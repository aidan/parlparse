I am satisfied that our acquisition process is appropriate to the task, and I concentrate on it as a high priority. Indeed, towards the end of this year I expect to get a clearer view of the aircraft&#146;s overall acquisition costs and, as important, of the sustainment strategy.

The fundamental principle of the collaboration was to find ways of working together to improve the effectiveness of the build, but that it must not come at a cost or delay to the British project. We have been able to meet that principle thus far and I will ensure that we maintain it.</p>

Is the idea now that the French will build the back half and we will build the front half of two carriers? Would there be a cost saving in that?</p>

My noble friend is right that the aircraft carriers are being built in sections. That is a modern shipbuilding practice that has developed over a number of years. We are confident that the blocks&#151;a total of four, rather than the two that he describes&#151;will be successfully brought together and assembled at Rosyth. The collaboration with the French explores opportunities to make savings in procurement, as there is obvious potential for economies of scale in buying three of everything rather than two, and then sharing the savings between us. The principle was formed on a one-third/two-thirds basis.</p>

The important principle behind the project is that building these carriers&#151;at 65,000 tonnes, the largest two ships that the Royal Navy has ever had&#151;requires the entire assets of the British shipbuilding industry. All of the yards have to work together. Our alliance approach has worked well in making the yards better at communicating and collaborating. There is still some way to go on change within the industry, and that needs to happen before we are in a position to order these two carriers, but it must not be at the expense of the build timescale.</p>

Under that definition, will not most of the taxes to which he referred have a pretty marginal effect environmentally? In practice, to have any substantial effect, would not green taxes, if that is what they are called, have to be pretty huge and raise little or no revenue in order to have any impact at all on these serious environmental problems?

What is important is that we condition and change public behaviour. Our taxation system is designed to reinforce those changes in public behaviour and she will recognise that we are having considerable success.

In Darfur, 107,000 people have been displaced since January, the total number displaced now rising to 1.2 million, and 4 million are dependent on aid. Insecurity, lack of access and a tax on humanitarian agencies continues to hamper severely the delivery of aid.

Can the Minister tell the House when the heavy-duty package which he referred to when we last discussed this issue will be put in place?

The problem will plainly not improve until not just the heavy support package but the whole of the hybrid African Union and United Nations force can be deployed. Discussions are proceeding on that but, I agree, far too slowly. It is a matter for businesses to decide whether they will impose sanctions; I hope that whatever sanctions they impose do not impact on the people of southern Sudan who are not guilty of any of the crimes that have been described by the noble Lord. However, each time one of those decisions is taken, it seems to reflect a very sound ethical principle.</p>

Does he agree that the object of international engagement should not be to enable one side to prevail over another but should be to promote political accommodation and power-sharing within Sudan?</p>

Atrocities have been committed by all parties fighting in Darfur; they are all violating ceasefire agreements and attacking civilians. None will escape with impunity from the consequences that the international community insists upon. Until there is a comprehensive discussion on a peace as well as a security solution, the prospects for ending the conflict are very poor.</p>

Since it has finally been agreed by the Government of Sudan, five months after it was mandated by the Security Council, what obstacles remain to getting the troops on the ground and getting the attack helicopters, which have been accepted as part of the package, deployed in Darfur? Will the noble Lord explain what difficulties have been raised by Chad and the CAR to deployment of the peacekeeping mission which would enable them to restore order and return hundreds of thousands of displaced persons in those countries to their homes?</p>

However, the logistic problems lie in making sure that there are adequate camps, clean water, munitions, and so on. That should be dealt with relatively quickly. The Government of Chad object to having other troops on its soil, much in the same way that the Government of Sudan object, but it is plain to me that, unless a humanitarian effort is mounted by the United Nations, the problems in Chad will not be resolved any more than the problems in Darfur.</p>

Is it not a fact that the Chinese supply much the largest proportion of arms to the Government of Sudan and are the major customers for its oil, taking 90 per cent? Are these not underlying factors which influence the situation? Would it not be useful, given our limited influence on this horrific situation, to press upon the Chinese leaders their responsibility in trying to ease the tension and reduce the atrocities?</p>

We have tried to explain in some detail that if insecurity in Darfur continues, as it will, it is likely to derail the north-south peace process for the whole of Sudan. In those circumstances, whatever the investment that the Chinese have made in oil in Sudan, it will not be worth anything.

Is her department not aware that in many cases when such ballots have been held there have been very serious allegations of irregularities, ranging from questions misleadingly framed to tenants being denied the right to vote, those opposing the council&#146;s position being denied access to the list of names and addresses of those entitled to vote, the council staff acting as both administrators of the election and advocates of one of the options and people other than tenants and residents who are entitled to vote&#151;including <I>Evening Standard</I> journalists&#151;being able to get hold of ballot papers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0704309000067"></a>In the light of these reports of cases, some of which have ended up in court, is it not necessary to have some establishment of the basic rules of democracy, whether through the Electoral Commission or some other body, so that these ballots are dealt with in the same spirit as the legislation covering national and local elections, referenda and trade union ballots?</p>

Very few indeed have raised any problems about the conduct or consultation or the ballot itself. I am interested in what the noble Lord said and would be very grateful if he could provide some evidence that we could look at. However, the process is safeguarded in two ways&#151;first, by the guidance in the transfer manual guidance that we put out, which sets out how scrupulous local authorities must be in involving and consulting tenants, including on the ballots. The ballots themselves are overseen by the Electoral Reform Society&#151;and there could be no more authoritative body than that. Tenants have to have knowledge about the options available; they have to have balanced information and be properly and fully engaged. Before any transfer is agreed, the Secretary of State has to be fully understanding of that, and there must be no evidence that tenants are opposed to the process.</p>

Is not the real answer to this to change the funding regime so that local authorities or housing associations can ensure that the housing stock is properly looked after?</p>

Since the decent homes programme was set up we inherited a &#163;19 billion backlog of 2 million homes that were below the decency standard. That is well on the way to being put right. We shall have &#163;40 billion invested by 2010, and we would not have had that amount had we not put the decent homes programme in place with the ability to transfer stock so that registered social landlords could borrow on the open market. That has made a huge difference to the number of people who are now decently housed.</p>

The ballots have been conducted by the Electoral Reform Society, which uses an extremely thorough process, with built-in safeguards on identity, balloting methods and procedure, and so on. We do not have the evidence that the noble Lord mentioned. Our evidence suggests that the ballots were secure and independent and that the procedures were as they should be.

One of the major differences is that they have voted in overwhelming numbers, because there is a higher turnout for these ballots than in local elections. The average turnout is over 70 per cent. Tenants now make up one third of the members of the boards that run those housing associations, giving them far greater involvement with and ownership of their terms and conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0704309000083"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 95. I have tabled these amendments to ask for further clarification from the Government about the process by which anti-fraud organisations will be specified under the provisions of this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70430-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0704309000084"></a>Clause 61(1) confers powers on a public authority to disclose information as a member of a specified anti-fraud organisation or otherwise in accordance with arrangements made by such an organisation for the purposes of preventing fraud. That is a complicated way of indicating that information is to be shared more widely, but among organisations that must meet specific standards if they are to take part in that exchange.</p>

<a name="70430-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0704309000085"></a>Between Committee and Report, I met representatives of both Experian and CIFAS. Noble Lords will recall that Experian is a leading UK credit reference agency. CIFAS is a fraud prevention service covering the United Kingdom. It was created in 1988 by a group of retail credit companies and now encompasses many types of financial service organisations including banks, building societies, insurance companies, credit card companies, share dealers and finance houses. The Minister referred to CIFAS in Committee.</p>

<a name="70430-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0704309000086"></a>I am grateful to both organisations for their helpful briefings. It was as a direct consequence of discussions with them that I felt that it was right to ask the Minister to set out more clearly today the process of designation that the Government expect to implement as a result of the Bill. The Minister gave us some assistance on these matters 26 March. I refer to col. 1513 of the <I>Official Report</I>. The anti-fraud organisations will be specified by order of the Secretary of State. As a result of a recommendation made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which was accepted by the Government in Committee, that statutory instrument will be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0704309000087"></a>It will be vital that the system of designating bodies is secure, effective and capable of withstanding attacks by criminals who would wish to gain access to or corrupt the information that they hold. The system of designating them must be right and those bodies that we designate must properly be able to deal with the information to which they will have access and hold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0704309000088"></a>What will be the criteria for the designation of anti-fraud organisation that will be specified under the provisions of the Bill? Who will make the decision about which organisations shall be so specified? At the outset, is it the Government&#146;s intention that at least two anti-fraud organisations will be designated, perhaps to include CIFAS, in order to avoid creating a monopoly position? Does the Minister agree with the view of the British Bankers&#146; Association, circulated to noble Lords, that the,</p>
<ul><a name="0704309000158"></a>&#147;likely outcome should involve more than one organisation ... and that if a single organisation only were to be chosen, then that could be open to monopolies&#146; challenge&#148;?</ul>
<a name="70430-0002.htm_para11"></a>

She has clarified that, in part, the amendment is intended to make clear that the provision applies to any anti-fraud organisation which may be specified under Clause 61 and that there is a prospect that more than one organisation may be specified. I am happy to affirm her assertion in that regard. I am glad to be able to confirm that because it has always been the Government&#146;s intention that no organisation should have a monopoly on being specified for the purposes of Clause 61.</p>

<a name="70430-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0704309000091"></a>As the noble Baroness indicated, I have already mentioned that CIFAS, the UK&#146;s fraud prevention service, is the type of organisation we have in mind. I can give the House reassurance, if reassurance is needed, that we would not intend that CIFAS, if it is specified, or any other one organisation should alone be able to benefit from the provisions of Clause 61. The Bill achieves that effect. Clause 61(1) refers to being,</p>
<ul><a name="0704309000159"></a>&#147;a member of a specified anti-fraud organisation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0704309000146"></a>I can assure your Lordships that this wording ensures that the number of organisations that can be specified is not limited to one. It follows that the additional words which the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Henley, seek to include in Clause 61(8) are unnecessary. I am happy to reassure the noble Baroness in that regard.</p>

<a name="70430-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0704309000092"></a>Amendment No. 95 changes the definition of &#147;specified anti-fraud organisation&#148; in Clause 62 by adding &#147;body corporate or not-for-profit organisation&#148; to the list of those who might qualify as the &#147;specified anti-fraud organisation&#148;. My understanding is that the definition of &#147;person&#148; already accounts for bodies corporate by virtue of the definition of a person in the Interpretation Act 1978. As a result, the amendment would not add substantively to the definitions in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70430-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0704309000093"></a>There is, of course, interest both within the House and outside about the process of designation of the specified anti-fraud organisation under Clause 61. I

The Bill deliberately leaves the question open. Subsection (8) simply says that,</p>
<ul><a name="0704309000160"></a>&#147;&#145;an anti-fraud organisation&#146; means any unincorporated association, body corporate or other person which enables or facilitates any sharing of information to prevent fraud or a particular kind of fraud or which has any of these functions as its purpose or one of its purposes&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0704309000147"></a>That is, I suggest, a very straightforward and open requirement. &#147;Specified&#148; means specified by an order made by the Secretary of State under the negative resolution procedure under Clause 76(6).</p>

<a name="70430-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0704309000094"></a>The detail of how the Government will consider which organisations to specify has still to be worked through. However, we envisage that the data-sharing by public authorities, which is enabled by Clause 61, will be made subject to some sort of code of practice&#151;a matter to which I intend to refer when we discuss Amendments Nos. 96, 97 and 98. The terms of that code would obviously need to be subject to prior consultation. An important test for any prospective specified anti-fraud organisation&#151;or organisations; there could be a number&#151;would be a willingness and ability to comply with the requirements of any code if public authorities were to disclose information to it for the purposes of preventing fraud. That could be a central test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0704309000095"></a>However, we would not want to go so far as to suggest how any specified anti-fraud organisation should go about its business. We would see that as a matter for the organisation and would not wish to impose any pre-set mechanism. I hope that that brief explanation helps to give the House some idea of how the Government envisage anti-fraud organisations being specified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0704309000096"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee report and the affirmative resolution procedure. She will know that the DPRRC said that the negative resolution procedure was an appropriate method of designating a body, and we accepted that assertion. The affirmative resolution procedure is appropriate for orders under Clause 62 but not under Clause 61. I hope that the noble Baroness will be content with that, and I am happy to have been able to put that explanation on the record for the purpose of clarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0704309000107"></a>I am grateful to Mr Vernon Coaker, the Home Office Minister, for arranging between the Committee and Report stages a meeting with the Information Commissioner, Mr Richard Thomas. The meeting was attended by my noble friend Lord Lucas and myself, and we both found it most constructive. I want to put on record that I found it invaluable to hear from the IC himself an overview of his position regarding the  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_877"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 877</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provisions of the Bill and his recommendations for improvement. His opinion has determined my approach to amendments at Report throughout the whole of Part 3.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0704309000108"></a>The discussions helped me to crystallise in my mind the core amendments that should be made to the Bill to make it work more effectively and fairly. The Government have already tabled some such amendments, which we shall reach later in the group beginning Amendment No. 105. Of course I shall not pre-empt that discussion, but there remains one issue that has not yet been resolved. It is covered by my Amendment No. 96. I believe that it is important for public confidence in the new proposals for data matching and data mining that the Information Commissioner should have the authority to initiate assessments. The Home Office Minister, Mr Coaker, made it clear at our meeting that he was prepared to take up this proposal from the Information Commissioner by way of an amendment. Will the Minister tell the House what progress the Government have made with their own amendment on this matter? Are they still committed to ensuring that it is inserted in the Bill, and do they believe that that will be achieved before the Bill leaves this House? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="0704309000109"></a><b><a name="70430-0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0704309000240"></a>The Earl of Northesk:</b> My Lords, it may be convenient if I take this opportunity to make a few comments about my Amendment No. 97 in this group. Unfortunately I was unable to attend the meeting arranged so helpfully by Vernon Coaker, and referred to by my noble friend Lady Anelay. Manifestly it was an extremely useful and constructive occasion for all those in attendance, not least because, as my noble friend said, it has inspired the Government&#146;s later amendments, which effectively make unnecessary the new clause proposed in my amendment.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0704309000110"></a>We shall come to those in due course. For the moment, and I hope as some measure of comfort to the Minister, I merely note that in these circumstances I see no need to pursue my amendment. Be that as it may, I hope that your Lordships will permit me to make just a few comments. I am both relieved and encouraged that in this instance the Government have recognised that the Data Protection Act does not necessarily offer adequate safeguards. It seems to me that across the piece, Ministers are too often tempted to suppose&#151;perhaps somewhat glibly&#151;that its mere existence is a panacea, and they therefore parrot the mantra that reliance on that Act provides sufficient comfort. However, as I sought to tease out in Committee, the technological landscape has changed dramatically since the legislation was enacted some 10 years or so ago and, in consequence, it is a moot point as to the extent to which it retains effectiveness and robustness. Quite apart from that, as the Minister freely acknowledged in Committee, the Bill limits its safeguards. She said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0704309000161"></a>&#147;Clause 64 amends the Data Protection Act to allow for sensitive personal data to be processed for the purpose of the prevention and detection of fraud&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/3/07; col. 1512.]</ul>
<a name="70430-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0704309000111"></a>That point was confirmed at paragraph 1.39 of the report on the Bill by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Moreover, having revisited our debates on the DPA, it is my impression that its drafting was left  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_878"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 878</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deliberately &#147;loose&#148;&#151;if I may put it that way&#151;in a number of areas in order to satisfy the expedients of future-proofing. In other words, it was recognised that special and/or exceptional circumstances would require specific legislative provision over and above and beyond the text of the Act itself. Dare I say it: the data-matching and information-sharing provisions of this Bill seem to be just such an occasion. Regardless, it is much to the credit of both the Government and the noble Baroness that the amendments have been brought forward.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0704309000112"></a>Indeed, while I am not holding my breath, I can hope that her welcome enlightenment on this issue may spread to other departments. That said, there is a tangential issue about which I hope the Minister might be able to offer me some information, if not comfort. The volume and spread of the Information Commissioner&#146;s responsibilities are extensive and growing. Consequentially, I am always slightly concerned as to whether his office is adequately funded and resourced. More specifically, having arrived at a set of circumstances where we are satisfied that appropriate checks and balances are pretty much in place, it would be regrettable if they could not be acted upon due to inadequate funding. I hope that the Minister can reassure me on that point.</p>

It was immensely helpful and clarified a lot of worries. However, it focuses me on my noble friend&#146;s amendment. We need the Information Commissioner to be proactive in order that the provisions in the Data Protection Act have effect, to ensure that proper records will be kept and that what is going on is entirely proper. I echo the last point made by my noble friend Lord Northesk. At that meeting, I discovered that my appeal, in my private capacity to the Information Commissioner, is the record outstanding Freedom of Information Act appeal, which has been running for over two years and is still unresolved. Therefore, more resources for such things in the future would be very welcome.</p>

The noble Baroness knows, as do I, that all Ministers are bound by others&#146; decisions before making any final decision. I understand why the noble Baroness teased me by phrasing it in the way she did. However, for the record, this issue is being looked at. Whether it will be ready by the time the Bill leaves this House is another matter. I hope that I will be able to respond more fully to the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns and those of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, who I thank for his helpful indication of how he intends to deal with his amendment. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0704309000116"></a>Amendment No. 96 inserts a new clause after Clause 63 which amends the Data Protection Act regarding the duties and powers of the Information  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_879"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 879</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Commissioner.

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0704309000117"></a>I would like to start by explaining the similar power already provided to the Information Commissioner in the Data Protection Act. The Information Commissioner can require the data controller of a body or organisation, through an information notice, to produce information for the purposes of determining whether the data controller has complied, or is complying, with the data protection principles.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0704309000118"></a>Any body or organisation dealing with or processing personal information will be registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner. This includes all bodies using the powers under Clauses 61 to 65. It is not in their interests to refuse access if they wish to satisfy him that their activities comply with the Act.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0704309000119"></a>Failure to comply with an information notice is an offence under Section 47 of the Data Protection Act. In addition, the Information Commissioner has the power to issue enforcement notices to enable the commissioner to investigate and rectify instances of non-compliance with any of the data protection principles and any requirements of the relevant regulations.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0704309000120"></a>We believe that adequate powers are already provided to the Information Commissioner in this regard, without further provision. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Henley, are willing to withdraw this amendment. I have already indicated how we are looking at this issue.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0704309000121"></a>Amendment No. 97 creates a provision for the Secretary of State to produce and disseminate guidance to all those using the data-sharing powers under Clause 61. It would require that the guidance be disseminated to all those involved in the data sharing, that it covers the type of sharing of information that can take place between and among themselves and the circumstances in which that sharing can take place. The amendment also provides that the guidance should be maintained under review and that the Information Commissioner should be consulted on its content. I see the noble Baroness&#146;s hand in that, because it requires that the guidance should cover the procedure designed to ensure accuracy and security of information being shared under the powers, the procedures to ensure co-ordination, procedures to govern the circumstances in which information can be shared and so on. The final requirements of this section of the amendment cover the procedure guaranteeing the rights of the data subject and those governing the period of retention.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0704309000122"></a>Amendment No. 98 of the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, adds to Amendment No. 97 with a further requirement on the Secretary of State regarding the destruction of data used in data processing. In Committee, I explained why I thought such a prescriptive and detailed requirement on the Secretary of State to provide information was unnecessary and unworkable. That is still the case. However, the Government understand what lies behind the amendment: providing some form of framework for the data sharing enabled by Clause 61.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0704309000123"></a>As the noble Baroness indicated, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, Vernon Coaker, hosted an informative and productive meeting with the Information Commissioner on 18 April. I was not privileged to attend that meeting, although the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, have indicated that they were. In the light of that discussion, we are now considering how best to provide a suitable framework. We are unlikely to come to the conclusion that such a prescriptive framework, as suggested by these amendments, would be appropriate. We are more likely to reach a view that these matters would be better addressed through a code of practice, which itself would contain the detail.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0704309000124"></a>We hope to return to the House with a more definite indication of our plans, if not their implementation, by Third Reading. In the circumstances, given the Government&#146;s further consideration of these matters, which can be further pursued in another place if necessary, I hope their Lordships and the noble Baroness will be willing to withdraw their amendments. I have found it helpful that we have been able to have these discussions and progress the matter in a collaborative way. We have done a great deal of work to obviate the need for more when the matter goes to the other place. We would have preferred to tie up all the loose ends, but I am not confident that we will be able to dot every &#147;i&#148; and cross every &#147;t&#148;. I suppose it will give the other place a little something to do.</p>

They are always proactive in looking at the detail of the application of data protection legislation. I make it a practice to go to them as my first port of call on any such matters coming before the House. My noble friend Lord Crickhowell asked me to give the noble Baroness his apologies.

That is why she says she does not wish to go ahead with my noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 97 and the system there. She says that she hopes to be in a position to give a better indication of the process by which a code of practice might be achieved and operate by Third Reading. That would be most helpful, but she also refers to the core issue, the substance of my Amendment No. 96: the position of the Information Commissioner. We agree with him that he ought to have a proactive role. The Minister is cautious in the language she uses; she said that the matter is being &#147;looked at&#148;, but that whether it will be ready for Third Reading is another matter. I am sure

This group includes government amendments in relation to England, to which my noble friend Lady Scotland will speak later. Our ambition is to create a system with safeguards that apply equally to all relevant audit bodies in different jurisdictions. The amendments will have the effect of amending not only the Audit Commission Act 1998 but also the relevant legislation in Wales and Northern Ireland; namely, the Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004 and the Audit and Accountability (Northern Ireland) Order 2003, as specified in Schedule 6, with respect to the insertion of new powers to undertake data-matching exercises. For that reason, Amendment No. 99 amends Clause 65 to reflect the fact that Schedule 6 to the Bill will make provision for data matching more generally, not just in respect of England under the Audit Commission Act.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0704309000134"></a>Amendment No. 103 governs the disclosure of information in order to allow the Audit Commission to disclose the results of data matching to local government auditors in Northern Ireland. This is consistent with the overall purposes of new Clause 32D(2)(b) and new Clause 32D(3) as they currently stand, where we have recognised that benefits may arise from sharing the results of data matching on a cross-border basis with the relevant auditors in the devolved Administrations. The amendment recognises that in addition to being able to share data-matching results with the auditor general for Northern Ireland, the Audit Commission should be able to share results with local government auditors in Northern Ireland. This reflects the audit arrangements in place in Northern Ireland and is a natural consequence of the extension of data-matching powers to relevant audit bodies there.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_882"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 882</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>new Clause 32D(3) are, strictly speaking, bodies but are office holders, such as the respective auditors general. The purpose of this amendment is to remove the potential for confusion.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0704309000136"></a>Amendment No. 115 to Schedule 6 amends the Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004 to grant the Auditor General for Wales statutory powers under which to carry out data-matching exercises and provides safeguards for the appropriate conduct of such exercises. It will ensure that data matching in Wales is conducted on a similar basis to that in England. The amendment is necessary to ensure that the national fraud initiative and the benefits it provides may continue in Wales with the necessary safeguards. The amendment includes provisions for bodies other than Welsh local authorities and Welsh NHS bodies to provide data to the auditor general for matching. Such participation will be on the proviso that the auditor general thinks it appropriate. He will have to satisfy himself that it is appropriate to accept the data and that it would meet the purpose of the data-matching exercise.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0704309000137"></a>It is envisaged that, in practice, the auditor general would co-operate closely with the Audit Commission, as he has done to date, to undertake the same national fraud initiative exercise in Wales that is undertaken in England. The most recent national fraud initiative cycle led Welsh public bodies to uncover fraudulent and erroneous payments totalling &#163;2.6 million and, as in England, the auditor general used the results of the exercise to help public bodies in Wales make their systems more robust in the protection of public money.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0704309000138"></a>The Welsh provisions will allow the sharing of data-matching information across the Welsh border. That is necessary to reflect the cross-border facility in the English provisions, and it is important as some fraud involves multiple claims of, for example, housing benefit from local authorities on both sides of the border.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0704309000139"></a>The Welsh data-matching provisions provide the same safeguards as those in the English provisions, including those added by later government amendments. The auditor general&#146;s data-matching activity will, as ever, be subject to the processing requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998. An additional safeguard is that the activity may not be used to profile individuals on the basis of patterns that suggest potential to commit fraud. The auditor general will have to prepare a code of practice for data matching, consult the Information Commissioner on it and lay it before the National Assembly for Wales. The conduct of Welsh data-matching exercises will have to have regard to that code of practice. Anyone disclosing data-matching information outside the permitted purposes in Schedule 6 will face criminal sanctions. In short, the amendment replicates for Wales the Bill&#146;s data-matching provisions for England.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0704309000140"></a>Amendment No. 116 extends the application of the powers we are creating for the Audit Commission in England to Northern Ireland and incorporates the same safeguards. It will mean that Northern Ireland&#146;s Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to use  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_883"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 883</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the powers to conduct data matching to assist public bodies to detect and prevent fraud in his jurisdiction. The proposals differ from the arrangements in England only to the extent that many of the functions provided by local government in England are provided by central government in Northern Ireland. That affects the range of bodies mandatorily required to provide data to the auditor general.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0704309000141"></a>The amendment will also enable cross-jurisdictional data matching and sharing of information between the Audit Commission and audit authorities in Northern Ireland. It is important that that should be the case because, as I said, fraud does not respect national boundaries. The amendment will enable a more proactive approach to be taken to fraud prevention in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0704309000142"></a>It is envisaged that the auditor general would co-operate closely with the Audit Commission to undertake similar national fraud initiatives in Northern Ireland to those in England, with the same potential to identify fraudulent payments and errors. The same restrictions and safeguards will apply to Northern Ireland audit bodies in applying these powers as apply in England, including compliance with the Data Protection Act. There will be criminal sanctions for disclosure of information outside permitted purposes, restrictions on the use of patient data and a code of practice governing the data matching on which the Information Commissioner will be consulted, which will be laid before the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0704309000143"></a>Amendment No. 129 ensures that data-matching provisions in Wales are in line with those in England, including those on the safeguards to ensure the appropriate conduct of such activity. It enables, in respect of Wales, the inclusion of an appropriate deterrent from disclosing data-matching information outside the circumstances set out in Schedule 6. The amendment would modify the saving provision that takes account of the need for Section 282(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to commence before a maximum sentence of 12 months can be given for the offence of unauthorised disclosure of data-matching information&#151;by virtue of Section 64D(8) of the Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0704309000144"></a>Amendment No. 134 to Clause 80 removes the confinement to England and Wales that would otherwise apply to proposed Part 3 of Schedule 6. It is needed to take account of the inclusion of data-matching provisions for Northern Ireland in Part 3.</p>

<a name="70430-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0704309000145"></a>Amendment No. 99 allows for the extension of the data-matching powers being created for the Audit Commission in England to Northern Ireland and Wales. Amendment No. 116 creates this power, under proposed Part 3 of Schedule 6, by inserting the provision in the relevant Northern Ireland audit legislation. The amendment simply restricts to Northern Ireland the extent of proposed Part 3 of Schedule 6. As this amendment inserts data-matching powers into the Audit and Accountability (Northern Ireland) Order 2003, it is necessary to restrict the extent of the provision to Northern Ireland only. I beg to move.</p>

It is absolutely right for Westminster to legislate for Wales on these matters, but has the Welsh Assembly been consulted? If so, what is the Government&#146;s response?</p>

First, although I appreciate that the amendments do slightly more than just extend the scope of the orders to Wales and Northern Ireland, it seems rather unusual to add something as basic as this at this late stage. Why are these amendments being introduced now? Perhaps it is as a result of the consultation that my noble friend Lady Carnegy has been asking about.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07050110000003"></a>Secondly, Amendment No. 103 allows information to be passed on from the Audit Commission to the so-called local government auditor in Northern Ireland even though there is no provision for data sharing at local government level in England or Wales. I hope the Minister can explain the Government&#146;s rationale for the extension of the sharing of matched data. Have the Government considered that widening the provision could endanger the security of such data? Not for one minute would I want to cast aspersions on local authority auditors; rather, I mean to note that the information systems to which they will have access for storing data may not be quite as secure as those at a higher level. Perhaps the noble Lord will give some thought to those points and explain the reason for these last-minute alterations to the Bill.</p>

I expected the Minister to comment on the report from the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Paragraph 1.37 of its 12th report refers to information sharing and expresses concern that,</p>
<ul><a name="07050110000137"></a>&#147;the power of public authorities to share information with anti-fraud organisations is drafted in terms too general to satisfy the requirement in Article 8 ECHR that interferences with the right to respect for private life be sufficiently foreseeable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050110000111"></a>The report continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07050110000114"></a>&#147;In order to make the effect of the new power more foreseeable, and therefore more legally certain, and to make it less likely that the power to share information will be exercised disproportionately, we recommend that the Bill be amended&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050110000112"></a>It makes a number of suggestions, including,</p>
<ul><a name="07050110000138"></a>&#147;to limit the width of the power, for example by specifying the kind of information which may be disclosed ... to introduce additional safeguards on the face of the Bill&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70430-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07050110000005"></a>Overall, the Joint Committee says,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="07050110000115"></a>&#147;In our view this amounts to an inappropriate delegation of discretion to anti-fraud organisations to decide to whom they will disclose sensitive personal data&#148;.</p>

Although the Government have significantly altered their stance on the scope of the orders, they nevertheless maintain their determination to cross-match people&#146;s personal data from all sorts of areas in an attempt initially to detect crime and fraud, but with a power to extend the purposes for which the matching takes place to further areas. I appreciate that, possibly as a result of some of the comments that we have already made, those powers are to be limited by another amendment, to be moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, in its place. Those provisions are already incorporated in the Welsh provisions. However, the power amounts to a typical and serious intervention in the private lives of the people of Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07050110000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked why we propose to amend the Bill now rather than perhaps adopt a different approach. There was consultation when approval for the provisions was sought. At that stage, it was understood that the Bill was intended to put the national fraud initiative on a statutory footing and include an order-making power for the Secretary of State to increase the jurisdictional extent of that initiative beyond England. Later instructions were prepared, in December, which changed the position so that the data-matching provisions should operate only in England. The change reflected recognition of the competence of devolved Administrations in public sector audit matters and data-matching exercises. Critically, however, it was also assumed that the devolved Administrations would consider the adoption of provisions equivalent to those being made for the Audit Commission to enable an extension of the data matching among bodies in their own jurisdictions. Given the importance of the issue, it was felt that there was a strong case for trying to resolve all these issues together and as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07050110000016"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment would prevent data in the children's index or the national identity register being shared or used in data-matching exercises for the purposes of identifying and preventing fraud or for such other purposes as the Government may choose. The purpose of sharing and using data is, at least initially, for the prevention and detection of fraud. It is not for the protection of children. It was for the protection of children that Parliament agreed to the legislation authorising the creation of the children's index. Providing in-depth access to the data in these databases for the purposes covered by Part 3 amounts to an unacceptable example of function creep. The Government say that they want to collect and retain our personal data for one purpose, but then seek to use those data for another, unrelated purpose in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07050110000017"></a>When it comes to the collection of data for the children's index, the Government have heard from these Benches on numerous occasions in the past few weeks, not least from my noble friend Lady Walmsley, about the sensitivity of this issue and how it is becoming increasingly obvious to parents that information which is given about their children may be used for purposes that they did not envisage.

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07050110000019"></a>The objective of the amendment complements the concerns that we on these Benches hold about the Government's policy of using individuals&#146; personal details, which seem to be filling Whitehall databases daily. We raised the issue of mining the NIR for data and came extremely close to protecting the electoral register last year from infiltration within the NIR during proceedings on the Electoral Administration Bill. Indeed, Amendment No. 99A in the name of the noble Lords, Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Dholakia, reminds me very much of the amendment that we brought forward in that Bill. I am sure that my noble friend Lady Hanham and others will be delighted that her amendment has been adopted and reincarnated in another Bill. Imitation is the best form of flattery.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07050110000020"></a>At that stage, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, stated that no dialogue could occur between the NIR and the electoral register unless the affirmative regulation procedure had been followed under the Identity Cards Act 2006. I ask the Minister whether the same procedural safeguard will apply when it comes to authorising the Audit Commission to conduct data-matching exercises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07050110000021"></a>When we debated my Amendment No. 116 in Committee, at col. 1579 on 27 March, I raised questions about the national identity register. As this is Report, I will not repeat all that. However, I asked the Minister to explain how the Bill would guarantee that the NIR could not be used for data-mining or data-matching purposes except in cases of serious crime. I reminded the Minister of our extensive debates on the Identity Cards Act and her assurances about using the NIR where serious crime was involved. She responded at col. 1583 and said that the assurances she gave during passage of the Identity Cards Act remained true. She went on to say that the intention would be to use the register only to identify crime where a specific provision was made in the law introducing it or where the Government had decided not to do so because its use would be voluntary. Does that remain the position today? If so, how, if at all, does it meet the objectives of Amendment No. 99A?</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07050110000022"></a>The Minister went on to give her opinion that the Audit Commission would wish to use the register only for serious crime in any event. Have the Government discussed that with the Audit Commission, and what is the basis for her opinion? How can we be sure that that will be the outcome given the drafting of the Bill, which refers to &#147;crime&#148; rather than &#147;serious crime&#148; in Schedule 6? I hasten to add that when we debate the drafting of Schedule 6, I shall not press for a definition of &#147;serious crime&#148;, for reasons that I shall adduce later.</p>

It is designed to facilitate a co-ordinated approach to providing care and services to children&#151;something which, around the House, we have emphasised and underlined as necessary. Its purpose, as set out in Section 12 of the Children Act 2004, is expressly linked to the duties in the Act on local authorities and their partners to co-operate to improve the well-being of children and to safeguard and promote their welfare. Access will be restricted to those who need it in connection with their work, including, for example, those in education, health, social care and youth offending. That is something which we have sought on all Benches to secure.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07050110000028"></a>Section 12 of the Children Act 2004 gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations governing the disclosure of data for the purposes of ContactPoint, in relation to both the bodies that must contribute data to this directory and the circumstances in which data from it can be disclosed. These regulations are due shortly to be laid before Parliament and are subject to affirmative resolution. That may satisfy the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07050110000029"></a>Given the careful policy considerations that underlie the drafting of the Children Act, in particular Section 12, and the deliberate decision to vest in the Secretary of State the responsibility for making regulations  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_889"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 889</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>governing the appropriate disclosure of information from this index, I am loath to pre-empt those decisions by making it impossible in this legislation for the Audit Commission or the specified anti-fraud organisation ever to have access to these data.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07050110000030"></a>For the present purposes, it is very difficult to see how the data contained in the ContactPoint would be relevant to the specific task of assisting in the prevention and detection of fraud. That is a criterion that has to be satisfied for data matching. We must remember what the Audit Commission will be able to do in obtaining data for data-matching purposes and that there are important limits on those powers. Even where the Audit Commission is able to require bodies to provide data on a mandatory basis under Section 32B, this must reasonably be for the purpose of conducting data-matching exercises that are designed to assist in the prevention and detection of fraud. So where data are provided on a voluntary basis, that must first be deemed appropriate for the purposes stated above, which will be a judgment that the Audit Commission as a public body will be required to make on reasonable grounds. I cannot see it but those would be the tests, and I think that how they would operate would be relatively safe and straightforward. On the basis of the regulatory framework already provided for in the Children Act and the limits on the Audit Commission&#146;s powers to obtain information, I do not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to make the further amendment that is sought.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07050110000031"></a>Let me take this opportunity to explore whether part of the impetus for this amendment is the fear that data matching might be used to profile the propensity of children to commit offences in the future. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, had that in mind. I see him nodding. It is the sort of issue that I anticipate might concern him. I can quickly put his mind to rest by saying that I have tabled the amendment that will prevent the Audit Commission profiling individuals, both adults and children. So we have got rid of that difficulty.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07050110000032"></a>I turn now to the national identity register, which, as your Lordships know, is not yet in existence but will hold identity information on everyone issued with an ID card. It is intended eventually to include everyone aged 16 and over who is resident in the United Kingdom. I should stress that this will be a register of identity&#151;information such as name, address, date of birth, nationality and so on. It will include photographs and biometric information such as fingerprints, but it will not be an amalgamation of every bit of personal data held by government. So there will be no criminal records, medical records or tax records.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07050110000033"></a>It is conceivable that under the Identity Card Act 2006 information in that register could be supplied to the Audit Commission under the statutory gateways already provided for in that legislation and subject to the terms of the secondary legislation. In particular, Section 20 of that Act would  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_890"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 890</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allow for the provision of specified information in the register to a specified public authority for a specified purpose. This would in theory enable identity information to be provided to the Audit Commission, but no information could be provided under Section 20 unless and until an order subject to the affirmative resolution procedure has been debated and agreed by both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07050110000034"></a>The national fraud initiative is one of the very tools that might in the future provide the basis on which provision of information to the Audit Commission might be necessary in order to confirm an individual&#146;s identity or provide particular information relating to a person, such as date of birth or address. Therefore, we can see no reason in principle why we should seek expressly to prohibit the Audit Commission&#146;s use of the register in the manner proposed.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07050110000035"></a>Similarly we believe it would be a mistake not even to admit the possibility that the national identity register could be effectively and properly used for the prevention of fraud within the terms of Clause 61. One of the statutory purposes of the register as specified in Section 1(4) of the Identity Cards Act 2006 is the prevention and detection of crime. So, at a general level, if one accepts that fraud is a serious problem&#151;the Government do, and the noble Lady opposite has said that she does too&#151;and a corrosive problem that undermines confidence and makes us all pay more for services than we need to, it seems unwise to block off the use of means that might, and I emphasise might, be used to help to counter it. But the amendment is saying that in no circumstances could these two databases be used under this part of the Bill to prevent and detect fraud. I do not know whether either of them could or would be so used. In the case of the databases made under the Children Act 2004, I have already said that it is hard to conceive of their use for preventing and detecting fraud, but it would be going too far to rule them out from the start. We are not arguing in this part of the Bill for a free-for-all in the sharing or matching of data; it will be allowable only for the prevention and detection of fraud and will be subject to the safeguards of the Data Protection Act as regards proportionality and the other conditions which it applies.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07050110000036"></a>I also indicated when discussing Amendments Nos. 96, 97 and 98 that we will be looking to introduce a code of practice for data sharing that would ensure that such data disclosure as takes place under Clause 61 is entirely correct and proper&#151;one already exists for the Audit Commissioner. The range of safeguards available is such that we think that fears over the national identity register, which have been echoed by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, will not prove well founded. We think that fears about databases established under the Children Act 2004, which are demonstrated by the amendment, are also unfounded.</p>

<a name="70430-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07050110000037"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, asked for a general comment about the JCHR report. We very much appreciate the concern raised by the JCHR on Clauses 61 to 64. We are considering these matters further and will return to them later; we have already committed to doing so, albeit in another place. We will seek to do this as soon as we can.</p>

I hope that on that basis, and with the assurance that noble Lords opposite have done so much to underline about the need for care, attention and scrutiny, that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, will think that he has done his valiant best and can rest content that his duty is done.</p>

She agrees that the identity card register, when it comes into being, is not to be used for data mining, but that it cannot be ruled out. I do not see that as a proper answer to the amendment and I feel it necessary, as a matter of principle, to seek the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07050110000047"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I invite your Lordships to consider further the Government&#146;s amendments on the data-matching provisions of the Bill. I should like to make it clear that although I will speak as though they affect only the Audit Commission&#146;s work in England they will similarly apply to equivalent exercises undertaken by the auditing bodies in Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07050110000048"></a>Your Lordships expressed concerns in Committee that the Audit Commission could use its new powers to profile individuals on the basis of their particular characteristics and behaviour in order to predict their future propensity to offend. The Audit Commission had, and has, no intention of profiling individuals in this way. Rather, as I explained in Committee, the purpose of including a power to identify patterns and trends is to enable the Audit Commission to identify where individuals may be working in concert to commit fraud or crime, or where organised crime rings may be operating across a particular geographic area. As drafted, the definition of &#147;data matching&#148; would allow the Audit Commission to provide its analysis of emerging trends and patterns to those participating in the exercise so that they can co-ordinate their efforts in tackling at its root cause fraud that is happening now.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07050110000049"></a>I understand from the demonstration of the national fraud initiative that the Audit Commission recently gave to some Members of the House that the noble Lord, Lord James, was anxious to know how the national fraud initiative would help tackle organised crime rings where a Mr Big was lurking behind a number of small operators. I do not see the noble Lord in his place, but I know that it is an issue of concern and so I am happy to deal with it. As I have explained, this is precisely why the Audit Commission needs the power to be able to identify patterns and trends that emerge from data matching.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07050110000050"></a>Your Lordships may also recall the point I made to the House earlier; the new power will enable the Audit Commission to identify emergent risks in areas where existing fraud is on the increase so that bodies can better target their resources. That said, I do recognise that legitimate limits need to be in place to ensure the protection of individual liberties, not least privacy and the presumption of innocence, that citizens in this country are entitled to enjoy.</p>

I can understand the noble Baroness&#146;s concern considering the particular nature and purpose of the national  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_894"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 894</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fraud initiative. As we have said all along, this initiative is designed specifically to detect anomalies without making any assumptions as to guilt. On that basis, I have tabled an amendment which I hope will meet that concern. It will impose a sensible limit on the extent to which data matching can be used for the identification of patterns and trends in the national fraud initiative. Specifically, the amendment will ensure that data matching cannot be used to profile individuals according to their characteristics or behaviour so as to predict the likelihood of future offending. I hope that that will provide the desired assurance about what the Audit Commission can and cannot do with the national fraud initiative tool and, at the same time, leave in place provisions which are essential in the fight against existing fraud. I hope that the noble Lords, Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Dholakia, will agree with that. I know that that concern was raised on the matter.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07050110000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, propose that the Audit Commission should not be able to obtain patient data from bodies that are under a mandatory duty to participate in the national fraud initiative. Patient data are already explicitly excluded from the data that bodies may contribute to the Audit Commission on a voluntary basis. Therefore, Amendment No. 102 would effectively mean that the Audit Commission would not be able to require patient data at all.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07050110000053"></a>I must resist this amendment on the grounds that, first, the exclusion of these data could severely undermine the value of the national fraud initiative to the &#147;mandatory bodies&#148;, particularly NHS trusts, and, secondly, there are adequate safeguards to ensure that this sensitive information is dealt with in an appropriate manner. I should say at the outset that the national fraud initiative does not currently use medical records or clinical data in its data-matching exercises, nor does it have any plans to do so in the future.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07050110000054"></a>The term &#147;patient data&#148; is, however, defined more broadly than that to include not just clinical information, which the Audit Commission does not, in any event, use, but also demographic data, such as a patient&#146;s name and address. Specifically, patient data for data-matching purposes mean data that relate to an individual and are held for &#147;medical purposes&#148;, as defined in the National Health Service Act 2006. The term &#147;medical purposes&#148; is, itself, broadly defined to capture information held for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis and research, the provision of care and treatment and the management of health and social care services, as well as information about individuals&#146; physical or mental health or condition, the diagnosis of their condition or their care and treatment.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07050110000055"></a>The Audit Commission may wish to use demographic data in data-matching exercises where they could indicate fraudulent activity, such as where practitioners either knowingly receive payments from NHS trusts for patients who are no longer registered with them or duplicate payments for those patients. NHS trusts will be mandatory bodies for the purposes of the Audit Commission&#146;s data-matching exercises, and these data will be obtained from those bodies.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07050110000056"></a>However, we recognise that patient data&#151;even just their demographic aspect&#151;are particularly sensitive pieces of information. For that reason, following consultation with officials at the Department of Health, voluntary bodies have been precluded from providing any patient data, both demographic and clinical, to the Audit Commission on a voluntary basis under these provisions. In our view, this achieves the correct balance between, on the one hand, using patient data for those bodies for which we have decided it is especially important, and therefore mandatory, to participate in the national fraud initiative and, on the other, bodies for whom it is merely optional.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07050110000057"></a>I also draw your Lordships&#146; attention to the specific protections that will apply with respect to the use and disclosure of any patient data used for data-matching purposes. Where patient data have been included in the national fraud initiative, the results of those matches will, under new Section 32D, be disclosable only if the purpose relates to a relevant NHS body or its auditor. A breach of these provisions governing disclosure will attract criminal sanctions. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will not feel it necessary to press her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07050110000058"></a>I turn now to Amendments Nos. 101A to 101C, tabled in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Dholakia, Lord Burnett and Lord Thomas. They would have the effect of amending the proposal that we have tabled with respect to the Audit Commission&#146;s power to identify patterns and trends from data matching. I shall address Amendments Nos. 101A to 101C together.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07050110000059"></a>Their intention seems to be further to limit the extent to which the Audit Commission will be able to undertake data matching, first, by removing the words &#147;nothing more than&#148; and, secondly, by adding another circumstance where the Audit Commission will be specifically precluded from using its powers.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07050110000060"></a>I am afraid that we must resist these amendments for the following reasons. I refer noble Lords to the proposal that the words &#147;nothing more than&#148; be removed. I understand that the amendment is designed to ensure that data matching cannot be undertaken to profile individuals who are likely to commit fraud in the future, even if there are ancillary benefits to be had. I appreciate the concerns that have been raised in this House regarding the extent to which data matching may be used to profile individuals. This is precisely why I tabled Amendment No. 101. However, this subsequent amendment goes too far. The words &#147;nothing more than&#148; have been deliberately chosen to target the specific mischief we are trying to address, without compromising the exercise as a whole. I hope we all agree that we do not want the Audit Commission to be able to use data matching to identify patterns and trends in individual behaviour or characteristics so as to predict future propensity to offend. However, by removing the words &#147;nothing more than&#148;, we run the serious risk of losing data matches that indicate fraud that is happening right now merely on the basis that they might also be taken as an indication of propensity

We are seeking to preserve not simply ancillary benefits but the integrity of the core exercise itself.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07050110000061"></a>Noble Lords have proposed an amendment that will insert a further circumstance in which the Audit Commission will be precluded from undertaking data matching. I understand that this is to make clear that the Audit Commission should also be prevented from using data matching in order to identify individuals who may fit a profile of those who might commit offences in the future. I shall start by reiterating that the Audit Commission has no intention of using data matching to profile individuals in the first place, much less to identify individuals who may fit these. In any event, the amendment that I am proposing will already prevent the Audit Commission creating such profiles in the first place. If this is the case, it must surely beg the question as to exactly what it is anticipated the Audit Commission will have available in order to achieve the mischief that is feared. On this basis, we hope that the House will be content with the amendment. We think that it is significant; it hones the issue finely; and goes further than the amendment suggested by the noble Baroness. The reason it goes further is that we thought it important to have the clarity that will prevent the Audit Commission doing that which none of us would wish it to do, and that which it itself asserts it does not wish to do. Our amendment gets it just about right. As your Lordships know, I claim no credit for the drafting because those who are really experienced and specialist in drafting have helped us to do this on behalf of the House. With that, I hope that the noble Baroness, the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and other noble Lords will be content. I beg to move.</p>

I do not want to confuse matters further but I should like to give an explanation about Amendment No. 100, to which the noble Baroness has referred. In advance of today, I gave notice to the Front Benches and to the Lord Speaker that I would not move Amendment No. 100. It was a procedural device to ensure that on Report the noble Baroness could open the debate on this group of amendments and have the opportunity to answer any questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07050110000066"></a>That did not mean that I had no faith in my amendment but I will immediately indicate that the objective achieved by the Government&#146;s amendment fully meets my objections in Committee. As the Minister has remarked, the government amendment is broader than mine and is thereby even more welcome. I was trying to prevent a situation where individuals&#146; details could be data-matched or data-mined and used improperly in profiling individual characteristics. I am grateful to the Minister for tabling her amendments.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07050110000067"></a>The Minister referred to Amendment No.102. It picks up on a theme that I explored in Committee about the kind of patient data that will be data-matched or data-mined. In Committee, the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="07050110000122"></a>&#147;Patients&#146; data are not disclosable beyond the National Health Service&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/3/07; col. 1537.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050110000068"></a>I wondered how that was guaranteed in the Bill. Today, the Minister has given a helpful and full explanation of how information will be disclosable, not only in a voluntary, but also in an enforced statutory way, and will involve the National Health Service trusts.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07050110000069"></a>I have a further question on that. I have followed the Minister&#146;s arguments today but it occurred to me during her explanation that National Health Service trusts do carry out work for the private sector. The private sector buys time in operating theatres and operations are carried out. There is a close liaison between the National Health Service trusts and the private sector whereby both clinical and demographic data might be built up as a result of that exchange.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07050110000070"></a>I wonder whether it is possible that information held in the private health sector may find its way through a gateway in the NHS trust into the demographic use of data matching and data mining in this Bill. That occurred to me only as the noble Baroness was speaking, so if she is able to respond today, that would be helpful. However, she may wish to write to me on that and we might be able to resolve that before Third Reading.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07050110000071"></a>I am trying not necessarily to prevent demographic profiling and use of information which may properly prevent or detect serious fraud but to ensure that there is none of the function creep to which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, rightly referred earlier, and that we do not allow the Bill to leave this place with an imperfect and incorrect understanding of what information might be properly matched and mined and which might not.</p>

<a name="70430-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07050110000072"></a>We must ensure that the public have confidence in the process by which all this takes place. All of us will be aware of the daily scandals about patient data held on the NHS supercomputer. I was looking at the BBC website on Saturday and read that the Government had closed down the job application website for junior doctors amid fresh concerns of security lapses. This is an area in which we are talking about the National Health Trusts disclosing and using information. We need to be sure that it is secure and to know whether information held elsewhere may also find its way into that database.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07050110000081"></a>It is already the practice of the commission to publish a report once the results of data-matching have been properly investigated by the audited bodies and the exercise has been completed. The purpose of these reports is to provide to the public an overarching summary of the exercise, including the amount of detected overpayments and fraud. The reports do not, however, identify individual data subjects, although the commission may, from time to time, identify particular audited bodies following consultation with them. That might arise in circumstances where a particularly significant fraud has been uncovered as a result of a

In this way, the public can keep abreast of the commission&#146;s activities and form their own view as to the gains achieved by the national fraud initiative.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07050110000082"></a>The amendment will place the commission&#146;s existing good practice squarely in the Bill. Although the commission will be able to identify those bodies which have provided it with data in its reports, it will not be able to identify the individuals, partnerships or companies to whom the data relate unless that information is already in the public domain. Accordingly, the provision strikes the right balance between ensuring transparency and accountability on the one hand while, on the other, ensuring that the appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07050110000083"></a>On Amendment No. 106, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, propose that the code of data-matching practice which the Audit Commission prepares, and any revisions to it, should be made subject to the approval of the Information Commissioner and then both Houses of Parliament by way of affirmative resolution. On Amendment No. 107, the code should, alternatively, at least be made subject to the approval of the Information Commissioner. I know the noble Baroness and noble Lord will not be surprised that I shall resist that amendment. I am grateful to them for tabling it, because it again enables me to explain our amendments. I first reiterate the comments I made in Committee: it is not the role of the Information Commissioner to approve codes of practice issued by public authorities. It would severely undermine the Information Commissioner&#146;s independence, and therefore public credibility, if the situation were otherwise. It is probably for this reason that there are no precedents in any other context of which we are aware where the Information Commissioner has been required to approve another body&#146;s code of practice in the way now proposed.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07050110000084"></a>As a matter of practice, the Audit Commission will also seek to consult the Information Commissioner in preparing and revising the code and I will shortly speak further on this point on a government amendment. The Information Commissioner will retain a statutory overview on the Audit Commission&#146;s activities under the Data Protection Act 1998, which gives him all the powers of supervision and intervention that he needs.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07050110000085"></a>It is also for that reason that the further proposal, to require that the code be approved by both Houses of Parliament by way of affirmative resolution, is excessive. It would not be good use of the House's time, or that of our colleagues in another place, if we were required to deliberate on a code in circumstances where the task will already fall within the general supervisory and regulatory remit of the Information Commissioner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07050110000087"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 109, we believe there is some force in the points that have been made concerning the visibility of the code, which will spell out the standards that members of the public can expect when their data are matched and the detailed safeguards that will apply to each exercise. The amendment places a duty on the Audit Commission to send a copy of the code to the Secretary of State so that it can be laid before the House. It also places a duty on the commission to publish the code from time to time. The Government tabled Amendments Nos. 108 and 109 in order to meet the concerns that have been raised. We believe that they strike the right balance between the exercise of efficient and effective data matching by the Audit Commission and the safeguards that should apply to it. In the circumstances, I hope that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord will not move their amendments. I thank them in advance for keeping the amendments on the Marshalled List as it has allowed me to explain them. I hope that has assured the House that all that should be done has been done and that we are all in agreement. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07050110000090"></a>Amendment No. 105 is most welcome. It allows the Audit Commission to publish reports on the data-matching exercises that it conducts. We think that is an essential part of public accountability and transparency. The Minister said that it is good practice put into statute.

That is particularly welcome and is a more proper way forward than the solution in my Amendments Nos. 106 and 107. Having had the opportunity to meet the Information Commissioner, I understand why he would say that the government amendment is appropriate whereas he might feel that my Amendments Nos. 106 and 107 would impose a duty upon him that would not fit with his independence of action. I accept that the Government's amendments are superior to mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07050110000092"></a>Amendment No. 109 is particularly welcome because it provides for parliamentary accountability&#151;to a limited degree, it is true&#151;by requiring the Secretary of State to lay the code before Parliament. The Audit Commission will have to publish the code from time to time, which is important because it means that this House and another place will have a continuing ability to exercise their scrutiny. Throughout our debates on the Bill, noble Lords have spoken about how information technology is developing. The Government often use that argument as a reason for wishing to have flexibility in legislation, but it is an argument for Parliament having continuing scrutiny of measures that may have to develop in different ways to meet new needs in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07050110000095"></a>These amendments give me the opportunity to make a brief point that arose from the presentation on the Audit Commission's current fraud initiative. At present, information is brought to the commission on disks, which are carefully stored and then destroyed once the information has been used so that the record is gone. I asked why the commission used disks when we are dealing with electronic information. The reply was, &#147;We find it easy at the moment but we might want to move on to different methods of providing information, using electronic techniques&#148;. The risks would be different in such a situation. It is well known that, although you can remove information from computers, it is left on hard disks and there are ways of getting at it.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07050110000096"></a>It is important that the Information Commissioner in his exchanges with the Audit Commission ensures that, as new techniques are adopted, the commission takes the same care to destroy information and render it secure as it has done until now. We enter into a period of new vulnerability. My noble friend referred to recent incidents that showed the vulnerabilities of computer systems. I hope that the Information Commissioner will pay particular attention to that in his discussions with the Audit Commission and when the codes of practice are being drawn up.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07050110000105"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, government Amendments Nos. 110 and 112 limit the further purposes to which data-matching exercises can be carried out to those already listed in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, propose that the Secretary of State's order-making powers to add to the purpose for which data-matching can be undertaken should be removed in their entirety. Amendments Nos. 113 and 114, alternatively, propose the removal of the words &#147;in particular&#148; from proposed new Section 32G(2) of the Audit Commission Act 1998 and the insertion ofthe word &#147;serious&#148; in order to clarify the nature of the crime for which data matching may be extended to prevent or detect.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07050110000106"></a>I am afraid that I have to resist all these amendments. In relation to the first amendment, I would be chary about confining ourselves at the outset to undertaking data matching solely for the purposes of preventing and detecting fraud in circumstances where we already know that there may be other public evils which could be greatly ameliorated through the use of these exercises. Proposed new Section 32G(2) does not provide the Secretary of State with a carte blanche to add further purposes at his whim. Quite the contrary, this can be done only with the approval of both Houses under the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07050110000107"></a>With respect to the proposed alternative amendments, I turn first to the suggestion that the words &#147;in particular&#148; be omitted from new Section 32G(2). I understand this amendment is based on the primary concern expressed by noble Lords in Committee that, because the current list of potential new purposes is non-exhaustive, this creates uncertainty and therefore unease as to the nature and types of purpose that might be contemplated. To put it another way, one might describe this concern  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_903"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 903</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as possible function creep I think that the noble Baroness has described it like that in the past. However, if that is the case, we cannot see how the omission of the words &#147;in particular&#148; will make any difference. The section will remain open-ended because of the continued presence of the word &#147;includes&#148;, which imports the concept that these are examples only and not an exhaustive list.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07050110000108"></a>I can deal with the further alternative proposal to preface the word &#147;crime&#148; with the word &#147;serious&#148; in relatively short order. The simple insertion of this word does not, in itself, provide any guidance in practice as to what would qualify as a &#147;serious&#148; offence. The amendment makes no attempt to define what would constitute a serious offence and for that reason it simply will not do.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07050110000109"></a>Moreover, it is difficult to limit the uses to which this tool could and should be put simply by saying that it must be restricted to serious crime. I gave the example in Committee that the tool could be used to identify registered sex offenders working in schools. This in itself might be a breach of the conditions placed on a sex offender but would not be a &#147;serious offence&#148; within the meaning of Schedule 1. However, data matching may prevent or detect the offence committed when a person on the sexual offences register slips through the net and is employed in direct contact with children. I would also offer the example of immigration offenders. Overstaying visas may not be considered by some to be a serious crime. None the less, it is something that the public would be keen to see the Government use every tool available to them to prevent and detect.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07050110000110"></a>On Amendments Nos. 110 and 112, notwithstanding the specific objections I have identified above, I thank the noble Baroness for letting her amendment stay because it gives me an opportunity better to explain how we deal this. I can see merit in the thinking behind these amendments to ensure that the prior definition of any new purpose which may be added appears in the Bill. On that basis, I have tabled amendments that will confine the potential extension of purposes for which data matching can be undertaken to those currently listed as examples in new Section 32G(2): namely, first, assisting in the prevention and detection of crime other than fraud; secondly, assisting in the apprehension and prosecution of offenders; and, thirdly, assisting in the recovery of debt owing to public bodies. I hope that these amendments squarely address the specific concerns that have been raised. I thank noble Lords for pursuing these matters, which enabled us to have a good discussion and, I hope, come to a solution which meets all our ends. I therefore beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07050111000002"></a>The government amendments go a long way towards meeting the objections that I raised in Committee on 27 March at cols. 1578 to 1588 of the <I>Official Report</I>. They reflected our lengthy debate on the central group of issues in Part 3. I was concerned about the open-ended  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_904"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 904</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>powers to be given to the Secretary of State in Schedule 6 to extend the purposes for which data matching may take place. He could have used delegated legislation to add any purposes to the list in new Section 32G. At present, as the Minister said, data matching is limited to the prevention and detection of fraud.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07050111000003"></a>Top of my wish list was a measure that would confine the purposes to those already in the Bill and a measure requiring further purposes to be added by primary legislation. My objections to the list of examples of purposes for future consideration set out in new Section 32G(2) were objections of principle and practice. I was unhappy that if we accepted a subsection that gave a list of particular examples, we could today be fettering the House when it came to decide in future on its view of delegated legislation brought forward by the Government to add purposes already mentioned in primary legislation. It could have looked as though we had already indicated that those purposes listed in new Section 32G were acceptable and we might therefore have been free only to express a view if the Government brought forward a statutory instrument that referred to new purposes not listed in new Section 32G.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07050111000004"></a>I was concerned also that the list refers to &#147;crime&#148; rather than to &#147;serious crime&#148;, which I would have much preferred. I shall return to that matter. The Minister has given some clear examples of where it would be dangerous to go down the line of referring just to serious crime.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07050111000005"></a>In Committee, my noble friend Lord Crickhowell spoke strongly against the use of the term &#147;in particular&#148;. The Government's amendment makes it clear that the potential for expanding the list of purposes for which data matching may take place is now to be confined to those currently listed as examples, so the examples become a closed list. That is exactly what I would have hoped for; I welcome the amendment.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07050111000006"></a>The amendment gives the House the opportunity to decide now, while it is considering primary legislation, whether that list is appropriate. It prevents other matters being added by delegated legislation. The letter that noble Lords received from the Minister appeared to imply that the Government would not consider bringing forward by way of primary legislation any further purposes in the future. If that is the correct interpretation of her letter, it would be most welcome in the year or two for which Mr Brown takes over the helm.</p>

<a name="70430-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07050111000007"></a>I would have preferred it if the new subsection had referred to &#147;serious crime&#148; rather than &#147;crime&#148;. I accept all the arguments against that which the noble Baroness has adduced today. In addition, the Minister and I had a meeting between Committee and Report where we discussed the matter. She put forward the argument that if one were to have a reference to serious crime, one would need a schedule to the Bill to list the involved. That is not beyond the wit of man and woman, because the Government have two schedules to the Bill, Schedules 1 and 3, where they have tried to list crimes to be taken into account. We now know that that is a defective list and that they are going to change it, so perhaps I was right all along.

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07050111000020"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, this amendment stands in the name of my noble friend Lord Glentoran, and I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, for adding her name to it. The amendment is the same as one moved in Committee. On reading the Minister&#146;s response, I am afraid that I am not entirely reassured that the concerns that we raised were unnecessary. I am still not convinced that a single designated officer will result in the Northern Ireland team being given the priority it deserves or the flexibility it needs to adapt its strategy to the unusual circumstances of the criminal community there.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07050111000021"></a>However, at this stage, I would like to look more deeply at the pratical implications of the restructuring. I am deeply sceptical of change for change&#146;s sake, and I remain unconvinced of the Government&#146;s deeper motives behind this clause. There are three potential uses of an effective asset recovery agency; the first two are the most acceptable. Confiscating criminals&#146; assets is an effective method of redistribution against criminals and acts as a means of deterring potential criminals by ensuring that neither they nor their families will enjoy the fruits of their crimes during or after any jail sentence. Of course, there is a third benefit to the Government. It provides a very useful source of income. Can the Minister confirm that the Government are not intending to use the assets that Northern Ireland asset recovery teams bring in for operations outside Northern Ireland?</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07050111000022"></a>I am also concerned about the cost of this restructuring. How much do the Government predict it will cost to incorporate the current agency into SOCA and how do they intend to pay those costs? How long does the Minister envisage this restructuring will take?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07050111000023"></a>There are also the costs that are far more difficult to measure but are just as crucial to performance&#151;the effect of the change on the performance and morale of the current employees. There is absolutely no demand for this change from those on the ground or from the police or anyone else involved in asset recovery in Northern Ireland. I cannot think that it is to the benefit of asset recovery to force such a change on them. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07050111000025"></a>We need an absolute assurance that the merger of the Assets Recovery Agency and SOCA will not diminish the excellent work already done by the ARA, which was referred to in Committee. The noble Baroness gave us some reassurance but, like the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, we still have some concerns. Following the Committee stage, is the Minister able to give us any indication of the numbers transferring from the Assets Recovery Agency to SOCA? I refer her to <I>Hansard</I> for 27 March, when she said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_155"></a><a name="07050111000245"></a>&#147;The agency will dedicate at least the same level of resource in Northern Ireland as the Assets Recovery Agency currently spends, and SOCA's presence in Northern Ireland will be at least as large as the current office of the Assets Recovery Agency&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 27/3/07; col. 1592.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050111000115"></a>That predisposes me to think that, if only one officer is being used for asset recovery within the new set-up, SOCA will consume what was a much larger assets recovery unit. Would the Minister be good enough to comment on that?</p>

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="07050111000026"></a><b><a name="70430-0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07050111000599"></a>Baroness Scotland of Asthal:</b> My Lords, I say to the noble Viscount and to the noble Baroness that I hope I can reassure them that their fears of significant change to the detriment of Northern Ireland are simply unfounded. There is common ground between us on the merits of merging the key functions of the Assets Recovery Agency with the Serious Organised Crime Agency. We are also at one on the excellent work that the Assets Recovery Agency has done in Northern Ireland, which is rightly held in very high esteem by both politicians and the general public.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07050111000027"></a>The Government&#146;s clear aim is for that success and for the current level of asset recovery activity against criminals in Northern Ireland to continue after the merger. To ensure that our aim is realised and in recognition of the high profile, public confidence and notable success achieved by the Assets Recovery Agency in Northern Ireland in tackling organised crime through the recovery of assets, we have made specific provision in the Bill requiring the Serious Organised Crime Agency to appoint and designate one of its staff as a person with responsibility for the agency's assets recovery effort in Northern Ireland. We do not expect there to be significant cost relating to that merger. That is the same requirement that was imposed on the director of the Assets Recovery Agency in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The 2002 Act did not require the director of the Assets Recovery Agency to set up a separate unit in Northern Ireland. Equally, we do not believe it  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_915"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 915</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be appropriate to make specific provision in this Bill for such a unit to be established by SOCA. However, I am able to give a specific assurance that SOCA will have an assets recovery unit in Northern Ireland for the foreseeable future. I believe that such a commitment deals with the essence of this amendment.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07050111000028"></a>The aim of SOCA is to reduce crime and harm from those who would seek to commit such crime in Northern Ireland and to seize and to confiscate the assets so obtained. That exercise cannot happen without efforts in the Province itself. There will be no reduction in the attack on organised crime in Northern Ireland through the recovery of assets. We have given assurances that the resources currently made available to the Assets Recovery Agency will be retained in Northern Ireland for the purpose of proceeds-of-crime work. There will be no change in the drive to make criminals pay for their ill gotten gains.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07050111000029"></a>I want to make it absolutely clear that assets recovery work in Northern Ireland under SOCA will take account of local priorities. Assets recovery effort will continue to be aimed at local priority targets in the community who, if they were in England or Wales, might be of lesser interest to SOCA but are very important in a Northern Ireland context.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07050111000030"></a>The close working relationship that the Asset Recovery Agency has established with the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau is very valuable in the pursuit of criminal assets on both sides of the border and we are committed to continuing the close co-operation when ARA and SOCA are merged. What we want to avoid is imposing on SOCA and locking it into a rigid operating model for the future of asset recovery work in Northern Ireland. This amendment limits SOCA's ability to change its structures to ensure they are as effective and efficient as possible as regards the recovery of criminal proceeds and in the light of possible future developments. For these reasons we find the amendment unhelpful and would have to resist it.</p>

I cannot give specific details at this stage but there will be a separate action plan on asset recovery for Northern Ireland and that plan will be published. All ARA staff, whether based in England or Belfast, will have the opportunity to transfer to SOCA or the National Policing Improvement Agency. Every possible opportunity will be taken to ensure that we retain the current staff and experience in ARA in Belfast. We cannot guarantee that some will not take the opportunity to leave, but it will remain business as usual. It will be a matter for the director-general of SOCA to determine how best to use his staff in Northern Ireland following the merger. No decisions have yet been taken about the exact shape of the new organisation in Northern Ireland or the total number of staff to be based in

Under the Cabinet Office statement of practice, staff will be offered appropriate opportunities in line with their competencies. All staff will be kept fully informed of the progress of the merger project and both organisations have well established mechanisms and are fully committed to engaging with trade unions regarding the merger. On the practicalities, a tripartite merger project has been set up with representatives of all three agencies to ensure smooth transition that maximises the expertise and best practice of each organisation.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07050111000038"></a>In 2005-06, there were 10,990 offences involving firearms other than airguns. In the same year, firearms were involved in 1,115 serious incidents of violence against the person, excluding homicide, and there were 46 homicides with guns. The Library has supplied a mass of press comment; from the heavy papers alone on gun crime in Britain in the past couple of months, I quote three very short extracts. The <I>Guardian </I>referred on 16 February to,</p>
<ul><a name="07050111000256"></a>&#147;three gun murders of teenagers in 11 days and five killings since February 3&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050111000117"></a>The <I>Independent</I> said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07050111000257"></a>&#147;it is abundantly clear to those who work in areas such as south London that the &#145;gun culture&#146; remains strong&#151;and among young men it is actually getting stronger&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050111000118"></a>The <I>Daily Telegraph</I> said on 26 February in an article by the Chief Constable of Merseyside, Bernard Hogan-Howe:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_160"></a><a name="07050111000250"></a>&#147;Most of the victims of gun crime to survive either do not want to make a complaint or give us information to enable us to track down their attacker. We have seen an increase in the number of teenagers involved in gun crime&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050111000119"></a>He referred to,</p>
<ul><a name="07050111000258"></a>&#147;the need to change the culture of young people who carry guns&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050111000120"></a>So I make no apology for reintroducing my amendment.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07050111000039"></a>The purpose of the amendment is very simple: it is to help to get guns off Britain&#146;s streets, and thus to reduce gun crime, which is causing misery not just to those who tragically get caught up in it but to the far greater number whose anxiety has been growing over recent years. Whether they are right or wrong, they perceive themselves as vulnerable. The amendment would give the police a simple and over-riding power which would enable them to make it far more risky for anyone to carry an illegal firearm. Ideally, I would like to make it as risky as it would be for any member of the public who decided to take a gun on an aeroplane from one of Britain&#146;s airports, but that, I fear, we will never achieve. Frankly, no gun-carrying mobster or terrorist would ever risk trying to travel by air with a firearm, but the risk of carrying guns in the streets in Britain today is far too small.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07050111000040"></a>Under the amendment, the police would have the power, as and when they felt it appropriate, to check anyone, in any area, for firearms. Obviously, modern technology makes this far more rapid and effective than it used to be. The primary instrument is the metal detector, in all its many and sophisticated forms. It enables the rapid scanning of large numbers of people in a non-discriminatory way; it is unlike searching for drugs, which is slow, intrusive and involves selecting individuals under the existing stop-and-search powers which, as we know, can cause resentment and problems with community relations.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07050111000041"></a>With metal detectors, you can scan extremely fast, either by putting up a temporary arch, as we know so well, or using hand-held machines. If I am asked to take my keys out of my pocket and the metal detector is used again, it will confirm that I have no gun and I can go through. It happens very fast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07050111000042"></a>I know that the Minister is normally briefed by the Home Office to say that the police neither need nor want these powers. That is not what I have found. I am particularly glad to have had an invitation from the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, to attend last Monday the graduation dinner of the police service parliamentary scheme in the Cholmondeley Room, when I was able to discuss the amendment with a number of very senior police officers. All those with whom I discussed it welcome the prospect of such a power. I particularly noted the enthusiasm of Assistant Commissioner Tariq Ghaffur of the Metropolitan Police, who has particular responsibility for safety on London streets.</p>

<a name="70430-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07050111000043"></a>I believe that the people of Britain will welcome the knowledge that the police have this new power, just as most of us are glad that the use of modern technology has made our airports safer&#151;and, indeed, the Palace of Westminster has been made much more secure. Those who will be most grateful will be those who live in areas in which the gun culture is strongest, who depend on the police to keep their lives secure. I previously tabled this amendment to other Bills&#151;the Violent Crime Reduction Bill in May last year and the Police and Justice Bill last October. Each time, the Home Office resisted it. I am tempted to say, &#147;Well, it would, wouldn&#146;t it?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07050111000044"></a>The Minister has said and perhaps will say again that there are already many different powers of search. I know there are&#151;I am sure there are. However, as I pointed out on 9 October last year, according to the Home Office&#146;s own website, firearms law is &#147;very complicated&#148;. Fighting crime today does not leave time for operational police officers to search the legal text books to ensure that they have cover for what they find that they need to do. I am asking that the police be given a wide and simple power, which they can use and which the public can understand. I am now giving the Government a third chance to take this step forward in the fight against gun culture. I beg to move.</p>

He is right to bring this matter before the House again and I hope that it may be resolved in his favour tonight. Illegal use of guns on some of our streets brings injury to some and misery to many; it is the scourge of the generation, in some areas. The considerable merit of my noble friend&#146;s amendment is the simplicity of the description of the powers that he seeks to confer on the police. I am aware, of course, that powers already exist that enable the police in certain circumstances to search people, but they are to be extracted from a myriad of legislative instruments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07050111000046"></a>After a spate of shootings in London earlier this year, the Prime Minister called together a gun summit in February. He brought together Ministers, police chiefs and community leaders for crisis talks on what he perceived himself as a growing problem. The media were told that there would be a review of gun laws to establish increased sentences for young offenders with penalties for being gang members. What has happened to that review?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07050111000047"></a>It was reported that at the summit Ministers were given clear warnings from senior officers who said that many shootings involved the same highly mobile criminals using the same stock of constantly circulating weapons. After the murder of one victim&#151;Billy Cox, aged 15, shot dead in his bedroom&#151;Cressida Dick, the Met&#146;s Deputy Commissioner, said that London offenders were now being caught in cities across the UK, either trying to take over the drugs markets or carrying out enforcement for local drugs barons. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_161"></a><a name="07050111000251"></a>&#147;We are dealing with greater mobility of the more serious and entrenched offenders. We are seeing firearms being used in several different crimes, and sometimes by different offenders. It is simple to hire a firearm for the night, give it back, and not be associated with it&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70430-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07050111000048"></a>It is important to take strong and effective measures against the illegal use of guns. If the Government want to give a clear message about their commitment to reduce the level of gun crime, they should accept my noble friend&#146;s amendment tonight.</p>

I have done so on three previous occasions&#151;and one thing you can say about the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, is that he has been consistent in his approach to gun crime. The Minister has said repeatedly that the Government have ample powers to deal with gun crime, yet the evidence is there before us to see that despite those powers gun crime is on the increase, too many innocent lives are lost and, more disturbingly, more and more young people, some of them children, carry or use guns.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07050111000050"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, was good enough to provide statistics. Gun crime has grown at an alarming rate in this country and has, overall, doubled since 1997. Crimes involving imitation firearms have quadrupled. The vast majority of people who legally own guns use them responsibly. The aim of further changes to the law must be to tackle the threat from weapons that are held or used illegally. Gun crime is a complex problem and tackling it requires a holistic approach. We need to use intelligence-led policing to attack the organised criminal gangs responsible for many of the shootings in some of our urban areas. To achieve better conviction rates, we need to encourage more people to come forward by improving the protection offered to vulnerable witnesses. It is also important that the Government support community groups that work with young people who are at risk of becoming involved in drugs and gun crime.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07050111000051"></a>We hope that the amendment will go some way in sending a signal that more needs to be done to tackle this problem and that the Government are not afraid to enact legislation of this nature. I am delighted, therefore, to support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07050111000053"></a>It was interesting that the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, mentioned the support that he received from senior police officers when he spoke with them. I have also spoken on this matter to serving police officers, who find it extraordinary that there has not been universal support for this measure and that it has not been introduced previously. One of them who served with me in Northern Ireland said that, in fact, there are more guns in this country than we were looking for in Belfast, when we had every available measure, such as metal detection and other methods, to help us and the police in searching for such weapons.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07050111000054"></a>I admit that it is extraordinary, given the level of this crime and the Government&#146;s keenness to act on many aspects of crime, that there is a sort of dilatoriness in dealing with gun crime, In addition to admiring the persistence of the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, in pursuing this issue, I point out that he has pursued the issue of a register of firearms; 11 years after Dunblane, one has still not been established. Extreme urgency seems to be attached to some other measures. I wish that the same urgency was put to the firearms issue, which is causing increasing concern among the people who suffer most.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07050111000055"></a>Last year, I went to a club in Moss Side, Manchester. There had been 15 or so murders around the club over the previous five years, all of which involved the use of firearms. I talked to a group of young people from a radio club called &#147;Unity Radio&#148; which was operated to provide these young people with information from the area. The question that came up over and over again was, &#147;Why can we not do more to rid this area of the guns that make our lives here such a misery?&#148;. We have here an opportunity to put in the police&#146;s hands something that would do that and which would therefore do so much for our people who are suffering from this problem.</p>

We live in a violent society. We have daily, or certainly weekly, reminders of the terrible use of violence to kill or wound people. The use of knives is one method, and brute force is another. People are dragged to the ground by a gang and kicked to death. Guns are a frequent method of inflicting death. That violence involves, among other things, rival gangs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07050111000057"></a>This House should be looking at ways to make the country safer. Today we are looking at firearms. We have a simple proposal to give the police the power to search people or vehicles for firearms. This is not indiscriminate stopping, there has to be a genuine belief. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, is founded on the proposition that a police constable or officer believes that firearms are being carried by a person or are in a vehicle. We are not dealing with something random. We are dealing with very serious crime. I hope the Minister, when she puts forward the Government&#146;s answer, will not resist it on technical grounds based on the language because the amendment could be redrafted in various minute respects and perhaps made easier to apply. One might have expected the amendment to be embraced warmly

Tonight we want to test the principle of whether this House is in favour of giving the police a simple method of trying to catch those who are carrying guns and to cut crime.</p>

As has been brought out in this short debate, we are facing a year-on-year increase of the gun culture. It is partly due to the complexities of the law surrounding the undoubted powers of the police to search for guns. The laws are proving less than satisfactory because they are so complex and, as we heard, because police officers are unwilling or at any rate reluctant to get involved in them.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07050111000059"></a>The Government have been charged with being dilatory by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham&#151;a less charitable word would be &#147;obstinate&#148;&#151;and taking refuge in the fact that there are many ample powers, as Ministers have said, to deal with guns. I think that my noble friend Lord Marlesford&#146;s proposal has this very strong beneficial effect: it is simple. Presentationally, it will be known in the circles where guns are carried that the police now have the power to seal off an area and search everybody and that you are more likely to be caught. That is the essence of the proposal&#146;s virtue. I hope the Government will cease to be dilatory and say, &#147;Yes, let&#146;s give it a try&#148;.</p>

Successive Governments have regulated the legal use of firearms to the point where many believe that the legal owner is over-regulated. Yet society as a whole has steadily lost control of the illegal carrying and use of firearms, particularly over the past four or five years. The growth is obvious. I will not weary the House with the figures because they are a matter of record. Guns are carried as a fashion accessory, as many of us know. They are carried illegally to further a turf war, often driven by the drugs trade.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07050111000061"></a>One of the more worrying factors about the current growth of illegal firearms is the quite awesome power of the weapons concerned. The low-velocity revolvers and sawn-off shotguns of the old days, highly dangerous though those two weapons were and are, nowadays have far been surpassed by the growth of weapons used by criminal gangs. They include military weapons or weapons that use Parabellum ammunition, very high-velocity projectiles and often fully jacketed bullets, and often they are fully automatic weapons with a staggering rate of fire. Young people&#151;they often are young&#151;are in possession of those sorts of weapons, so a largely unarmed police force is facing a highly dangerous situation on the streets.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07050111000062"></a>In passing, it is worth noting that the majority of patrolling officers know that they could very well meet someone with that sort of weapon in their possession who has a desire to use it in order to evade arrest, and those officers are continuing to patrol our streets. An amendment such as that proposed by the

It would give incredible courage and support to an overstretched police force; it would help to make our streets safer; and it would help to drive crime down.</p>

My noble friend Lord Marlesford has been raising this point for so long that I am beginning to wonder whether the Government have some sort of policy hang-up in this area. It is not possible to think of any good reason why this matter is still in limbo, so I ask myself whether there is a bad reason for it. If there is a bad reason, which I would define as a lack of commitment on this whole area of policy, perhaps we should know about it. The register is not the subject of the amendment, but the whole response of the Government on gun crime seems to be a little gently paced and I think that we need to see things moving rather more rapidly.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Dear, made the very important point that those who own guns legally are over-regulated and those who own them illegally are not caught.

As the noble Earl said, loyal and legal citizens have been penalised and yet criminals are walking the streets and carrying guns with complete impunity. I do not feel that the Government are in control. I echo the words of the noble Lord who said that there seems to be nervousness in this area, but perhaps we can keep it under the carpet, so to speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07050111000066"></a>I also have very much in mind the police officers, who have a myriad of possibilities regarding what they can and cannot do but nothing very simple.

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07050111000069"></a>As I read the Bill, the amendment would apply to Scotland. I talked to one or two people because the noble Lord is my noble kinsman, and I was especially interested in discovering whether it would go down well in Scotland. It was thought that its simplicity and the fact that young people would understand it would go down very well indeed. As noble Lords will realise, ever since Dunblane, this subject has been much discussed in Scotland. I enthusiastically support my noble kinsman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07050111000070"></a> My Lords, I join others who have commended the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, on his persistence. As he said, this is the third opportunity he has given me to respond. I have to say that my response will be similar in nature to the responses that I have had the joy of giving him in the past. Rarely are such compliments showered on the Home Office&#151;dilatory, obstinate, stubborn. Some more flavoursome adjectives doubtless could come my way. I would rather say that we are being proportionate and reasoned.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07050111000071"></a>I agree with all those who have highlighted the pernicious nature of gun crime, but we have dealt with this matter with a great deal of vigour and energy. We are reminded once again by the recent tragic shooting incidents in London and Manchester that we still have a way to go to win the fight against gun crime. The Prime Minister acknowledged that at his summit on guns and gangs on 22 February, which has already been referred to. However, the reality is that gun crime is falling. Figures released on 26 April for the 12 months to December 2006 show a decrease in firearm offences of 16 per cent. In London, figures from the Metropolitan Police for the 12-month period to the end of March 2007 indicate a reduction in gun-enabled crime of 11.3 per cent. To say that it is not being addressed and is out of hand is contrary to the facts.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07050111000072"></a>Nevertheless, we have already put in place substantial legislation to support the fight to drive down gun crime. For example, there is the five-year minimum sentence for those adults convicted of unlawful possession of a prohibited firearm and the new offence of using someone to mind a weapon, which came into force on 6 April. We know that gun crime affects some communities in some areas disproportionately. The measure, such as that suggested in the amendment, is likely to impact disproportionately on those communities.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07050111000073"></a>Of course, this is not the first outing for this amendment, and I make no apology for restating the other reasons it cannot be accepted, which have not changed. Legislation is already in place, providing a range of enforcement powers to the police under Section 47 of the Firearms Act 1968. For example, in the circumstances specified in this legislation, a constable can require a firearm or ammunition to be handed over for examination. The person can be searched and detained for the purpose of the search.  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_924"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 924</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>If a vehicle is involved, it may be searched and the person driving it or in control of it can be required to stop it. Furthermore, for the purpose of exercising these powers, a constable may enter any place.</p>

<a name="70430-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07050111000074"></a>The Government are absolutely clear that they are fully committed to tackling gun crime. We are also committed to ensuring that the police have sufficient and proportionate powers to help make communities safe. The existing legislation helps meet those objectives, and no purpose would be served by duplicating the powers already available under existing legislation.</p>

As a result of the anti-social behaviour legislation and other Bills that we have put through, we have now got a power that enables the local authority and the police to designate an area for a particular purpose, if they believe that is necessary. We have to look at whether this power is proportionate, because proportionality has featured high. I notice the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, smiling, if not laughing.</p>

The Minister has misconstrued my remarks. She has just argued that there are ways of designating areas. I was remarking to my colleague that designation cannot take place on the spot. My noble friend's amendment gives immediate recourse to the police to carry out a search where they have reason to believe that firearms are being carried. I would never laugh about that. I was merely smiling at the Minister trying to get out of a very deep hole that the Government have dug for themselves.</p>

However, the powers that I have just identified enable the police to take appropriate action in every case where they fear that there is a gun or there may be reason to look for it, as I have indicated, both in the car and on the person.

It is clear that if the existing power is too complex one would have to look at whether it could be simplified. On searches, the law is clear, straightforward and for once, simple. The police are familiar with the legal provision setting out the extent of their powers. The existing power to search is not overcomplicated. The police are content that it works in practice and they use and have used this power for many years. Although firearms legislation might be complicated in other areas, it is not in relation to the existing power to search.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_162"></a><a name="07050111000252"></a>&#147;a) there are sufficient powers already in existence to detain and search; b) the amendment as drafted would create a wide extension of police powers; c) the power has not been requested by the police, nor do they identify a gap in current legislation that requires such new powers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050111000121"></a>That is the ACPO position, expressed on behalf of the police force. In making these consultations, it is only right and proper that we go to ACPO, ask the police what its view is and then listen to it. That is its informed, current view of those who are responsible for carrying out these duties on a day-to-day basis now, as opposed to what may have been or will be their position. We take those views very seriously indeed. There is therefore a concern which has been dealt with. If other measures are necessary, we will come back to the House to ask for further support. The review that was mentioned is ongoing. The first meeting of a working group including community members will be held on 18 May, reporting back to the round table on 26 June. The issue is under active and vigorous discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07050111000082"></a>Of course we understand the great need to get this right, which is why a great deal of time and attention is being attached to it. The National Firearms Licensing Management System has now been rolled out to all 43 forces in England and Wales. The final data-cleansing work to connect the system to the PNC is under way. We have come a long way. I absolutely agree with those who say that it has taken a long time compared to the National Firearms Licensing Management System. That is wide of the amendment, and I am happy to give that indication, but these amendments on Report are about whether we need further legislation. All the indications are that we do not. I therefore invite the noble Lord not to press his amendment, although I am confident that he will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07050111000090"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 121. In Committee I moved several amendments concerning the new powers that the Bill gives Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. I was grateful for the fullness of the Minister&#146;s answer then and the comprehensive letter that I received late last week, following up the points that she made. The noble Baroness will see that I have retabled amendments on only one of the topics that I raised in Committee, in a form that I hope addresses some of the technical points that she made.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07050111000091"></a>The amendments concern the powers in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to allow HMRC to obtain an intercept warrant, under Section 5, and to carry out intrusive surveillance, under Section 32. The powers are available to use for preventing or detecting serious crime as defined by that Act. Amendments Nos. 120 and 121 do not disturb the effect of Schedule 11 to the Bill, which is to extend the use of those powers to all HMRC activities.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_929"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 929</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70430-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07050111000092"></a>My amendment would confine the use of the powers to the prevention and detection of serious crime, hence removing the possibility that HMRC might use them in other circumstances by relying on one of the other purposes for which they may be used under the Act. The two other purposes are the interests of national security and safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07050111000093"></a>In Committee, the Minister said that HMRC, which can currently use the powers for just its former Customs and Excise functions, only ever applied for the use of the powers to prevent or detect serious crime. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_166"></a><a name="07050111000094"></a>&#147;HMRC does not apply to use the powers for national security purposes or to protect the economic well-being of the United Kingdom as HMRC&#146;s functions do not include those purposes and an application would be inappropriate and no doubt unsuccessful&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 27/3/07; col. 1615.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="70430-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07050111000095"></a>The functions of HMRC are somewhat illusive. The Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 basically says that the functions are to collect and manage taxes and that HMRC has all the functions that the former Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise had. We never managed to get a full list of those functions when we debated that Bill in 2005. HMRC&#146;s website does not take one much further. It summarises what HMRC does by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_167"></a><a name="07050111000096"></a>&#147;We are here to ensure that the correct tax is paid at the right time&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70430-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07050111000097"></a>In Committee, I sought to argue that since the collection of taxes is a crucial part of the economics of government it was not difficult to see an argument that pursuing tax assessment and collection could be to protect our economic well-being. When pursuing taxes which are being evaded through serious crime, no issue arises. But I pose the question of the pursuit of tax avoidance&#151;a wholly legal activity which involves no crime whatever. However, tax avoidance reduces the tax take, sometimes very significantly, and has the potential to harm the economic well-being of our country.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07050111000098"></a>The Minister&#146;s argument was that safeguarding the economic well-being of the UK relates to activity that is similar to the security of the state and was, hence, not available to HMRC. The Minister said that the powers could not therefore be used for tax avoidance. I put it to the Minister that the Act does not place this restriction on the use of the economic well-being powers.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07050111000099"></a>I fully accept that the Minister does not believe that HMRC should use the powers other than in the context of serious crime and should not use them for tax avoidance. But I hope she will see that there is some ambiguity in the statute and that it would be better to remove that ambiguity in order to protect future generations.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07050111000100"></a>In her letter to me of 25 April, the Minister pointed to the provisions of the interception of communications code of practice which makes an explicit link between economic well-being and state security, but that is only a code of practice and not the law. In addition, the code of practice for covert surveillance does not make the same link for Section 32 powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07050111000101"></a>The Minister will know that my amendments would in no way affect the RIPA powers for any of the other agencies who might need to use them: we have no desire to do that. My amendments are modest, relate only to HMRC and would simply ensure that what the Government think should happen will in fact do so. I beg to move.</p>

The amendments would place restrictions so that HMRC cannot apply to intercept communications, or authorise intrusive surveillance, in the interests of national security or for the purpose of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07050111000103"></a>As the noble Baroness knows, under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, intercepting communications and intrusive surveillance are subject to stringent safeguards and controls and are possible only where necessary to prevent or detect serious crime, in the interests of national security or for the purpose of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. I am grateful to her for highlighting her understanding of that and setting out what we debated on the last occasion. However, national security and the economic well-being of the UK are mentioned in the Act as these powers are available to a number of law enforcement and security agencies, some of which may need to use the powers for those purposes. I understand that she is saying &#147;I'm not talking about them, I am just looking at HMRC&#148;. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs applies to use these powers only for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime, not in the interests of national security or for the purposes of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. I was trying to make a distinction about the different roles that the different bodies would seek to take in applying those powers.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07050111000104"></a>Safeguarding the economic well-being and national security are not part of the statutory functions of that department and noble Lords may know that it is unlawful for an agency to act outside its statutory functions, so an application would be both inappropriate and unsuccessful. In particular, the purpose of protecting the economic well-being of the UK is concerned with matters relating to national security and this was discussed when the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 was debated. The link between national security and the economic well-being of the United Kingdom is also recognised and reinforced by the code of practice on the interception of communications. As the noble Baroness has identified, that code of practice states that the Secretary of State will not issue an interception warrant unless a direct link between the economic well-being of the United Kingdom and national security is established.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07050111000105"></a>In addition, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ensures that an authority to intercept communications can be granted as necessary only in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom where

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07050111000106"></a>Amendment No. 121 may also have drafting errors. It would insert new subsection (3A) into Section 32 of RIPA, but there is already a subsection (3A) that was inserted by the Enterprise Act 2002. If it gives comfort to the noble Baroness, I am always grateful for having officials who will trawl through the minutiae to stop me entering into error and I understand the noble Baroness's acuity in looking at these issues and that she may not necessarily have the number of people to support her in that regard. In addition, the amendment refers to paragraph (m) of subsection (5) of that Section, but that paragraph does not exist so the legislation would become difficult to interpret and operate. The amendment is possibly intended to refer to paragraph (m) of subsection (6) of Section 32 of RIPA.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07050111000107"></a>Amendments Nos. 120 and 121 are unnecessary as Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs can apply to use these powers only for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime and not for protecting the economic well-being of the UK or in the interests of national security. I therefore assure the noble Baroness and the House that the situation will not be altered by Schedule 11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07050111000108"></a>In addition, the amendments would complicate what is already complex legislation and could make it more difficult to interpret and apply. For these reasons, I must resist them.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07050111000109"></a>The noble Baroness was in essence asking how we can be sure that HMRC officers will use these powers appropriately and will not misuse them. The training provided to HMRC staff who are investigating serious tax crime, and the stringent safeguards and procedures that come with these powers, will ensure that they are used appropriately. The procedures ensure that any possible use of one of these powers is subject to strict internal scrutiny before an application can even be made for their use. The powers are used only where other methods of investigation have failed or would clearly not succeed in obtaining the evidence or intelligence being sought. Many of the powers require independent external authorisation before they can be used; for example, a warrant must be obtained from the Secretary of State before communications can be intercepted. The use of all these powers is also subject to regular, independent external inspection to ensure that officers use them appropriately. We have spoken in the past about the procedures that we have followed in authorising interceptions. Therefore, I hope that the noble Baroness will see that, although I share her concern about getting this right and I understand her fear of the possibility of one issue bleeding into the other in a way that we would both regard as wrong, we have structured the Bill in a realistic way which prevents that happening. Having given the noble Baroness that assurance, I hope that she will feel able to withdraw her amendments.</p>

When one reads the legislation, one must look at the purpose which is likely to be addressed by this agency&#151;that is, HMRC&#151;what its function is and, therefore, how it will be used. One then looks at the codes of practice which apply quite directly to each.</p>

<a name="70430-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07050111000113"></a>I am happy to look again at whether the code of practice needs to be refined. I do not believe that the codes as they are currently structured need such definition, but I am happy to write to the noble Baroness if, on mature reflection, we reach the view that something may need to be changed. I do not believe that that will be necessary, but I am happy to see whether my assumption is correct.</p>

That is helpful. In her usual way, she has pointed out the technical deficiencies of one of my two amendments and for that reason, I shall withdraw it today. I shall carefully read her remarks on the way in which HMRC&#146;s powers can be used. I do not believe that it is clear beyond peradventure that HMRC could not be said to be protecting the economic well-being of the country by the way in which it prosecutes its activities in collecting and managing the tax system. I shall carefully read what she has said at the Dispatch Box to see whether it constitutes sufficient assurance for those who may come to use these powers in the future and who may look back at what she has said.

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07050113000069"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this debate was stimulated by the formation recently of an All-Party Peers Group for Yorkshire and Humber. Issues and priorities often look different across different parts of the United Kingdom and the group is seeking to connect the House better to those in our region. I thank all the people and organisations who have sent us briefing material for today&#146;s debate. It is deeply appreciated across the House. I must apologise on behalf of the many noble Lords who are not able to be here this evening, but who are staunch Yorkshire folk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07050113000070"></a>Yorkshire and Humber is a large region of 5 million people. It has a population similar to that of Scotland, larger than that of Northern Ireland and Wales and larger even than that of seven of the 25 member states of the European Union. While output per head in the region is below that of the national average, growth in output has been above the UK and European Union average for years now. The past 20 years have seen a transformation in the region. Previous dependence on textiles, clothing, coal mining, heavy industry, agriculture and fishing has been replaced by a diversified and vigorous economy. Advanced manufacturing remains significant and is predicted to grow by 12 per cent over the next decade. We have the country&#146;s largest concentration of food research and production, one of the fastest growing IT media and communications sectors in the UK and Leeds has the largest financial, legal and business services centre outside London.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07050113000071"></a>Hull and the Humber ports handle 22 per cent of England&#146;s sea freight trade, with 40,000 international shipping movements per year. Eighteen per cent of the country&#146;s electricity is generated in the region.  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_936"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 936</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Tourism is a regional strength too. National parks in the Yorkshire Dales, the North Yorkshire Moors and a small part of the Peak District comprise over 1,000 square miles in the region, or 21 per cent of the land area. In addition, the Yorkshire Wolds and other areas of outstanding beauty, stately homes, abbeys, priories, castles, York and the Bront" country all add to the tourist attraction. A recent study by the Council for National Parks found that the region&#146;s national parks did not just benefit tourists. Businesses in the parks and in nearby towns generate approaching &#163;2 billion worth of sales a year, supporting 34,000 jobs.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07050113000072"></a>The Yorkshire and Humber region is around 20 per cent urban and 80 per cent rural. Three of the largest UK cities are in the region: Leeds, Sheffield and Bradford. Then there are at least 25 other important towns and cities which you dare not forget, ranging from Hull to Halifax, Richmond to Grimsby, Barnsley to Bridlington, not to mention Wakefield, Beverley, Harrogate and York.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07050113000073"></a>What is striking about our region is that there is no massive urban sprawl. Our cities and towns are free-standing, with civic pride and loyalties and with beautiful countryside or coastal areas easily accessible. Yorkshire Forward was right to identify the need to ensure a vigorous future for our towns and cities, small or large, in its renaissance investment programme.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07050113000074"></a>Although our towns and cities are free-standing, they are increasingly inter-connected, as mobile people and mobile flexible skills integrate the regional labour market. I was pleased to note the move towards co-operation based on three city regions centred on Leeds, Sheffield and Hull and the Humber ports. These are the driving forces of sub-regional and regional growth and will pose new challenges for our civic and business leaders. At the same time, the rural areas in upper and eastern North Yorkshire must be properly served too.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07050113000075"></a>Culture plays a big part in the region. Opera North, Northern Ballet, Phoenix Dance and the West Yorkshire Playhouse are all based in Leeds. Alan Ayckbourn premires in Scarborough, and Sheffield hosts one of the UK&#146;s leading digital arts festivals. The International Indian Film Academy is holding the Bollywood equivalent of the Oscars in Yorkshire in June with 28,000 visitors expected into the region. The region is to be congratulated on securing this. Among other things, the National Media Museum in Bradford will host some key events, as will other towns and cities across the region.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07050113000076"></a>Yorkshire and Humber has eight universities, three higher education colleges and 42 further education colleges. York, Sheffield and Leeds universities have formed the White Rose Consortium with more research staff than Oxford or Cambridge working in departments graded at the highest levels, and the region&#146;s universities are leaders across the country in creating spin-out companies. The universities of Leeds and Sheffield have recently received national funding for an international centre of excellence on China and Japan, with the National Institute of

I declare an interest, having recently been appointed to the international advisory board of that centre.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07050113000077"></a>I have touched on some of the positives in the region, so perhaps I might just touch on some areas where improvement or comment might be needed. Transport spending remains firmly at the top of the region&#146;s agenda for business as well as for local government and the regional development agency. Transport is creaking in the region. The M62 is overloaded, as are parts of the M1/A1&#151;the north-south and east-west arteries. The railways are near or at capacity for passengers and freight on key routes. Transport links between Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester&#151;a crucial triumvirate, a triangle of energy and growth for the future of this country&#151;need to be greatly improved. Leeds and, I argue, the Leeds/Bradford conurbation need a rapid transit public transport system for the 21st century. Successive governments have ducked the issue for 20 years.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07050113000078"></a>The second area is skills. Those over 16 perform below average at GCSE, and the adult workforce is below national averages at higher level 4 skills. In parts of the region, more than a third of adults cannot read, write or count properly. Without wanting to sound harsh, I must say that the learning and skills councils, schools and employers have to raise their game, not just to help economic performance but to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared by all sections of society.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07050113000079"></a>The third area I wish to highlight is tourism. We have a large and diverse region, with national parks and a tourist board. Performance in attracting and bringing back visitors to the region has not been strong. Our tourist industry&#151;at all levels from bed and breakfast to four-star hotels, from bureaucrats in civic halls to tourist boards&#151;has been woeful in the past. There are real signs that the Yorkshire Tourist Board is at last moving in the right direction, with a new sense of focus and vigour. Our national parks are becoming focused on employment of business opportunities as well as, properly, their stewardship of national treasures.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07050113000080"></a>Finally&#151;perhaps more controversially&#151;I will say a word about housing densities. Our region has had very slow population growth in the past, and no growth is forecast for the next 10 or 15 years. Emphasis has rightly been put on brownfield site development as a means of sustainable regeneration, but there is no shortage of land in our region, which is one of our great assets. Yet, I see housing built at densities that are not sustainable, dwellings that will not be fit for purpose in many of our urban areas in 30 years&#146; time. Some high-density housing is needed for the changing population and household structure, but there is a lack of balance. Even family homes are being built at a density that reflects policies based on land shortages in London and the south-east. The region, to use a colloquial term, is missing a trick as well as failing its citizens. It has failed to build on one of its great strengths&#151;the ability to offer good housing, with plenty of space, in good surroundings.

He has spent much of his distinguished career in higher education at one end of Yorkshire, at the University of Leeds, latterly as dean of the business school. I, too, declare an interest in the region&#146;s higher education institutions, albeit at the other end of the region, as chancellor of the University of Hull. I am pleased that I no longer have to declare an interest as the sister of the chief executive of the Great North Eastern Railway and can now be unequivocal in my support for Hull trains without any domestic conflict. The noble Lord was right to emphasise the importance of transport to the region.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07050113000082"></a>The region is host to one of the highest concentrations of universities in Europe. That is a key asset which I want to discuss, especially when the universities in Yorkshire and the Humber act as such a potent economic catalyst in the region. This theme was explored in the excellent, well supported debate two weeks ago on the economic contribution made by higher education institutions in Britain. It was almost &#147;standing room only&#148; and was an example of the way in which all are working to integrate universities into the economic activities of different parts of the country.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07050113000083"></a>Let me add some further comments on the state of the economy in Yorkshire and the Humber. Undoubtedly, as the noble Lord said, the region has gone through significant economic changes in the past two or three decades. The old, heavy, secondary industries have declined; the cycle of economic change has often been painful, but the region&#146;s economy has emerged emboldened and now has a much more optimistic air. Manufacturing may not employ the numbers that it once did, but it remains a significant part of the economy, more so than in other regions. It is predicted that the manufacturing sector will grow by over 12 per cent in the next 10 years. The noble Lord referred to the importance of food production; in Hull and Humber is the largest concentration of food industries in the UK, employing around 48,000 people in that sector.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07050113000084"></a>Over the first half of the decade, the economy of Yorkshire and Humber was buoyant, with rates of economic and employment growth outstripping those of the UK as a whole. However, regrettably this performance is unlikely to continue for the next few years. Economic and employment growth rates are forecast to slip behind the UK average, partly due to the fact that manufacturing, which is not performing too well in UK anywhere at the moment, takes up a greater slice of the region&#146;s economic support. Here lies a threat but also, I believe, a significant opportunity. The threat is that without constant innovation the region will fail to prosper in the face of intense global competition, but the opportunity lies at  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_939"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 939</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the heart of my argument, in the crucial role played by universities in leveraging at innovation and facilitating its development and application. As the noble Lord and I stressed, the region is fortunate to have an incredibly strong network of universities.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07050113000085"></a>In Hull, there is a concerted and determined approach to economic regeneration, underpinned by recognition that a collaborative approach is essential. The university plays an integral part. Far beyond the estimated &#163;200 million contribution to the local economy, simply by dint of its presence it helps to analyse and shape regional economic development strategies, identifying and supporting sectors of greatest economic potential&#151;in our case added value manufacturing and logistics, biomedical healthcare and renewable energies. These play to the geographic strengths and economic traditions of the area. The House will be aware, for example, that the Humber ports complex is the UK&#146;s largest in terms of goods handled&#151;around 50 per cent of the UK&#146;s sea freight traffic. The regeneration process in the city of Hull is being led by the Hull city build initiative. The board comprises civic, business and academic leaders. By collaborating, the different sectors can gain the area a competitive edge and lever in more investment, both public and private.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07050113000086"></a>Last year the university&#146;s interaction with the local business community was worth more than &#163;14 million. This is exactly what Richard Lambert&#151;now, splendidly, director-general of the CBI, in which I should declare an interest as a head-hunter involved&#151;urged in his 2004 review of business-university collaboration. Businesses should look to collaborate with universities for research and development programmes. Universities must identify their areas of research strength and actively push for links with business.</p>

<a name="70430-0011.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07050113000087"></a>I suspect that the noble Lord has been an advocate for many of these policies for many years. What I believe is so exciting is how the policy has been taken to heart by universities across the country, but certainly at Hull. Lambert emphasised that, in almost every case, a business working with a university improves its performance, develops its products better, works smarter and sees an improvement in staff skills. This is especially true in the Yorkshire and Humberside region where less is spent on research and development than in other parts of the country.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07050113000088"></a>There are numerous examples at Hull of the mutual benefit of a close and productive relationship between industry, commerce and higher education. For example, Hull has developed two centres of industrial collaboration in engineering design and in environmental technologies. It supports knowledge transfer partnerships which simultaneously improve the competitiveness of the company partner and enhance the skills and experience of the graduate. A successful design enterprise centre has been developed, giving expertise and facilities to local industries. Pre-incubation facilities for student and graduate businesses will be accommodated in the new enterprise and innovation centre, greatly benefiting the economy and education. There is no ivory tower, but practical understanding and relevant and recent knowledge.</p>




<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_940"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 940</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70430-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07050113000089"></a>Two pioneering and pragmatic projects at Hull illustrate the economic potential of universities in regeneration especially well. The logistics institute, one of only five of its type in the world and the only such centre in the UK, will, through high-level education programmes, business-focused short programmes, workshops and consultancy have a major impact on business supply chains, always a key area of British competitiveness. Given Hull&#146;s history as a port, this is especially appropriate and, in time, will further boost Hull&#146;s business potential and competitive advantage. Secondly, the goal of strategic collaboration is splendidly exemplified by the Wound Care Institute, involving the NHS, the Hull York Medical School, the postgraduate medical institute and a major local employer, Smith &amp; Nephew. That has the potential to deliver benefits for all. The university has access to a diverse patient base and is able to deliver a strong foothold in R&amp;D. The company will gain excellent access to a local clinical trial centre and be able to accelerate its research and development and the NHS can build on existing services and provide a multi-disciplinary learning environment for staff. Patients have access to first-class local services.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07050113000090"></a>To consolidate and build on these success stories, there is a pressing need to guarantee financial support. The next few months are critical in determining the resources available for universities in the years ahead. As we approach the Comprehensive Spending Review, which determines the overall size of the resource cake, we must look carefully at how we can ensure that funding becomes consistent and predictable&#151;a point rightly emphasised in the UK&#146;s submission on the CSR. Secondly, it is vital to consider how the cake may most effectively be sliced. Funding received by Hull and other universities as a result of the RAE is key to the economic leverage that the university may gain for the region. As my noble friend Lord Norton recently pointed out in his authoritative speech in the higher education debate, there is considerable uncertainty on the future of the RAE, post-2008. Discussions between UUK and the Treasury are ongoing, and our vice-chancellor, David Drewry, is closely involved. I urge the Government to keep these economic benefits uppermost in their minds.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07050113000091"></a>I want to talk on a small point of concern. The recent CBI <I>Survey of Regional Trends</I> commented that one of the inhibitions on companies in the Humber region was the perception that the region has among potential customers. There are some who do not have an altogether positive view of Hull. They do not know about the city&#146;s recent rich and successful history and the recent commendable efforts that have been made to reclaim that vibrant past. As chancellor of the university, I am particularly committed to challenging ignorant assumptions about the realities of this historic city and its contributions today and tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07050113000092"></a>Hull is a fascinating place. As the House should well know, it is the birthplace of Wilberforce, who described it as the,</p>

There are many challenges for our region, but it has many splendid resources. My argument is that, by close collaboration with its rich universities, we will realise its potential as best we can.</p>

While it is run from the north-east, a large number of the companies operate from Yorkshire. The defence and aerospace industries contribute &#163;2 billion to the regional economy and we estimate that Yorkshire&#146;s share of that accounts for about &#163;1.2 billion and around 12,000 jobs&#151;a not insignificant number. They are mainly SMEs, and it has been my pleasure to visit a number of them since becoming the umbrella company&#146;s patron. NDI brings together all the companies which feed into the defence and aerospace industry and acts as a catalyst to inform and encourage companies to work together to offer economies of scale and innovation to the industry as a whole.</p>

The second area I want to talk about is the University of York, where I am a member of court.

They have created a genuine knowledge-based economy in Yorkshire. The University of York is one of Britain&#146;s top 10 universities and one of the world&#146;s top-ranking research institutions. It is a UK leader in a number of official performance indicators including research efficiency, research income per academic and low drop-out rates among students. It is the only university in the UK to have received three national Athena SWAN awards for supporting the career of women scientists. Perhaps I may give you one brief quote from the university&#146;s magazine. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_195"></a><a name="07050113000177"></a>&#147;York is working to attract women into science, both in academic and technical capacities. It is seeking to retain those women who might otherwise drift away by introducing more flexibility into the workforce and, at the same time, creating a better work environment for all staff&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050113000098"></a>The University of York and its science park contribute nearly &#163;200 million to the region and economy, a figure set to grow dramatically as they expand their research and knowledge-transfer and spin-out activity.</p>

Throughout the district, almost &#163;3 million has been identified to help various innovative schemes to come to reality.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07050113000101"></a>Public sector investment is therefore essential to help to develop the local economy. Catterick Garrison&#151;the largest Army base in Europe&#151;along with Richmond, its much smaller neighbour, is part of Yorkshire Forward&#146;s Renaissance Market Town programme, which helps to support the development of towns in rural areas. Indeed, Catterick Garrison is unrecognisable from the rather bleak Army camp that many of your Lordships may remember. They have many exciting programmes planned, and the RDA&#146;s investment is crucial to the survival and success of these townships throughout rural North Yorkshire.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07050113000102"></a>In Richmond alone, we have the station-building regeneration project, which will provide auditoria for meetings, exhibitions, a cinema and much more, together with office space and production units for locally made produce. This is a project dear to my heart and the hearts of the many hundreds of volunteers who have helped it along. It has generated a &#163;390,000 grant from the RDA, for which we are enormously grateful. We still have to find another &#163;129,000 but, because of the enormous generosity of many, many people, organisations and various funding agencies, we are nearly at the &#163;2.5 million mark that we need to pay for the rebuilding of this magnificent station. That is not bad for a small rural town in the heart of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07050113000103"></a>Of course, there are areas of concern, as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer. For example, much more needs to be done about tourism. Yorkshire Forward wants to maximise its investments on projects rather than on delivery and the projects are capital-led. We need to bring high spenders into our rural areas and the money that we are given needs to be flexible enough to deliver what those areas need. We need good market town managers to enable us to fulfil those aspirations and they must be supported by our RDA&#151;not just in start-up costs but in their sustainability.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07050113000104"></a>So there is a good story to tell about Yorkshire&#151;and, I hope, a continuing one. It is a wonderful place in which to live and we try to keep much of it a secret, because the county of broad acres should never become as overcrowded and overburdened as south-east England. You can breathe in Yorkshire.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07050113000106"></a>I add my congratulations to my noble friend Lord Woolmer. I know that he has done an enormous amount for Yorkshire and Humber, and his connection there goes back many years. However, I think that he has set us a bit of a problem. How do you speak up for Yorkshire and Humber without getting into a debate about regional policies? I want to speak up for Yorkshire and Humber because for 30 years my business was based in Leeds.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07050113000107"></a>It is very easy to agree that power needs to shift from Whitehall but it is equally easy to agree that there should be no widening of the inequality in this country&#151;the so-called postcode lottery. I suppose the answer is to recognise that we need national standards and rules for things which are national: the law, regulations, human rights and taxation. Nevertheless, each region has its own individual strengths and character, and that is why more citizens understand, and are interested in, what goes on at a local level. Indeed, it is their first port of call, which is local. This is why more people engage at a local level. Central Government can set basic standards but local councils can go further. That is what is reflected in the words &#147;Yorkshire Forward&#148;&#151;progress in Yorkshire beyond national standards.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07050113000108"></a>It is precisely that attitude towards progress and higher standards that is also reflected in the words used by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris: &#147;knowledge economy&#148;. Yorkshire Forward and the knowledge economy; of course they go together. I therefore agree with the noble Baroness that you will find that all the elements that go to make up a knowledge economy are being brought together in Yorkshire and Humber. Let me explain.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07050113000109"></a>In London, the emphasis is firmly on financial services and the ancillaries that go with it&#151;the lawyers, accountants, expensive homes and fancy restaurants. In Yorkshire and Humber there is a lot more balance. Yes, the financial services, the accountants and the lawyers are there, and so are the fancy homes and   


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_944"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 944</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>restaurants, but they are less dominant. They are there as part of the local business economy. Now add that to the manufacturing and the services which they need&#151;not only the skills training, the designers, the marketing, the universities and colleges that we have been told about, but the Design, Modelling and Simulation Centre that Yorkshire Forward has provided, as well as the Innovation Technology Centre at the Advanced Manufacturing Park and the manufacturing advisory services provided by the DTI.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07050113000110"></a>All those make the balance far more even. That balance supports and stimulates a modern knowledge economy. It is a modern type of cluster creating lots of new opportunities, yet structured so that the opportunities are not left to chance. All those elements need to talk to each other and work with each other. The manufacturers, universities, colleges, designers, marketing firms, training firms and the financial sector all need each other to create a successful knowledge economy. As the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, described, this is what modern knowledge transfer is all about. Indeed, this is what Materials UK does, and I declare an interest as the honorary president. And it works. As the senior executive of one of the well known Yorkshire food companies which we have been hearing about put it to me the other day, &#147;This cluster enables us to know what we did not know that we needed to know&#148;.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07050113000111"></a>As a result you have Camira Fabrics, a traditional furnishing fabric manufacturer in Huddersfield, working full blast because its manufacturing system has been modified to make it so environmentally friendly that every furniture manufacturer wants its fabric to be part of a greener economy. Next door there is another textile manufacturer working at full blast because it produces high-tech fabrics which monitor and control clinical conditions, minimise infection and which are themselves biodegradable.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07050113000112"></a>I mention these companies because they are ones that I know. I also point out that the textile industry in Yorkshire and Humber has not gone away; it has just gone technical. There are many, many more examples in other industries and services. Because of the ethos of enterprise and knowledge, and progress in Yorkshire and Humber, firms have reinvented themselves and their businesses, as my noble friend Lord Woolmer said. He reminded us of many things, such as rapid manufacturing and servicing, as well as advanced manufacturing, which are all taking place in Yorkshire and Humber. Some firms are scientifically growing things in factories now instead of making them. They are inventing composites to replace traditional materials. In Yorkshire and Humber innovation and commercialisation know no boundaries.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07050113000113"></a>So back to the question: what does Yorkshire and Humber contribute to the British economy? The answer is vigorously taking forward the modern knowledge economy to play an important part in improving the economic performance of the whole country. What does that tell us about regionalism?</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_945"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 945</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>am glad that he has been able to ensure this. It was just over a third of a century ago that county councillor Ken Woolmer and I first met. It is interesting that we are on similar themes a third of a century later.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07050113000115"></a>Yorkshire is big in the United Kingdom context. In many ways, that is easily understood. Perhaps there has been a bit of redrawing at the boundaries. Thornaby, Redcar and Saltburn have vanished somewhere up into the north-east and the coming of the Humber Bridge has brought us north Lincolnshire. However, if people were asked to name an area of England which appears to have identity, some might say Cornwall, but many would say Yorkshire.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07050113000116"></a>What is this identity? Is it about Yorkshire pudding cooked well? Is it about a dialect? I think the uniting feature might be the Yorkshire County Cricket Club. I see that it has started to do a bit better, which is helpful. However, as yet, there is no regional assembly. We hear of Yorkshire Forward and the Yorkshire regional assembly. These are names which are not regularly on many people's lips in Yorkshire.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07050113000117"></a>We know many organisations with the &#147;Y&#148; in front of them, such as the Yorkshire Tourist Board. There are several pan-Yorkshire organisations. It is important that there is a pan-Yorkshire identity, but there should be clarity of definition. It would be more helpful if there were. There are sub-regions&#151;west Yorkshire, for example&#151;and the body I spoke about with which the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, was involved.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07050113000118"></a>There are still many reasons why the former West Yorkshire authorities work together as a group. It has been just the same in south Yorkshire following the abolition of the county councils. However, we have now got city regions, which blur that which is Yorkshire.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07050113000119"></a>There is something else coming up and I am amazed how little I have heard of it. It appears that there is a proposal before the Government, which they encourage, for a north Yorkshire county council which embraces local government in its entirety. From Richmond to Selby, from Filey to Bentham, there are 580,000 people; substantial towns as in the geographical dissertation that the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, gave. Whether it is Skipton or Harrogate or Scarborough, the present thinking is to submerge this into a north Yorkshire which has an all-purpose way forward. When my noble friend Lady Harris mentioned the work in Richmond to redevelop the old railway station, it was interesting to hear that there seemed to be a unity of purpose with the community. Can that happen with a great body running from Scarborough to within 10 miles of Morecambe Bay as the only unit of local government? I have my doubts; I question that.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07050113000120"></a>It is important that there is not only a clear and proper definition of Yorkshire, but also a proper identity for the substantial towns and districts at local level. I have never been an advocate of reading the <I>Yorkshire Post</I>. It used to be owned by Yorkshire Conservative Newspapers Ltd, which still grates. On the front page on 24 April, however, a Mr Woolas says that Yorkshire must stop moaning and pestering. I hope that there are people in this House who can   


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_946"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 946</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>suggest that Mr Woolas pipes down a bit. Three times as much money is spent on transport pro rata in London than in Yorkshire. Bearing in mind the disposition of money allocation in the country and the limits on what can be raised locally or regionally, it seems proper for people in Yorkshire to make a case for transport investment.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07050113000121"></a>An interesting point about housing has been made by several noble Lords. I live half way between Halifax and Huddersfield, and positive reference has been made to textiles. Well, the story goes a bit the other way: there are a lot of empty mills. I used to make speeches saying that when I looked at an empty mill, it seemed as if one could make it into an office block. It seemed a good idea for some of these outfits with regional bases in Manchester and Leeds to shut them down and convert a mill in Calderdale. They would have had a wonderful office. Interestingly, it is now more difficult to say that, because other people now look at these mills and say &#147;What wonderful houses!&#148;. Many old textile mills are coming into housing, often in inappropriate sites for the weight of housing placed there, with infrastructure problems and so on.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07050113000122"></a>I have lived half way between Halifax and Huddersfield for 40 years. I previously lived between Leeds and Bradford. We should mention Bradford because the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, is not here and wants us to do so. When I was at primary school, the kids in the playground used to argue about whether it was better to go to Bradford or Leeds. You could have an argument. Today, it is a no-hoper, which is very sad. Coming back to another theme, it is a good job that we have a university in Bradford. If it were not there, it would be even worse.</p>

<a name="70430-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07050113000123"></a>When I first met the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, a third of a century ago, the county councillor was looking at what the county could do. He took the view that the might of the county could help the poorer places and those that needed it. For all this talk of Yorkshire Forward and the mighty Leeds, the idea that you can puff up Leeds and everything will somehow follow is not the right way forward. It may be one way forward, but work must be done in other parts of Yorkshire. Part of the job of government is to spread resources from the rich to the poor, which is equally important in regional policy.</p>

Since becoming a Member of your Lordships&#146; House, I have spoken in debates about the London economy but never before have I had the opportunity to speak about the contribution that Yorkshire makes to the overall UK economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07050113000125"></a>As one looks at the Yorkshire economy today, the first thing that strikes anyone who has known it for any length of time is the extent to which it has changed in a lifetime. There has been an almost total collapse of mass manufacturing and mining in much of Yorkshire. When I think of the journey I took as a boy from Rothwell into Leeds, a distance of five miles, virtually all the landmarks that I used to pass  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_947"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 947</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are no longer there: the pit, Skelton Grange power station, Yorkshire Copper Works, Hunslet engine works and the railway freight marshalling yard have all disappeared. Those institutions were huge employers, yet Leeds has never been as prosperous. As noble Lords have explained, the reason is the extraordinary rise of the service sector.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07050113000126"></a>We know that Leeds has been more successful than other places in Yorkshire. Bradford is a classic case of where, after the collapse of the monoculture of textiles, it has proved impossible to find a diversity of new businesses coming forward. In Leeds, there is tremendous strength in the service sector. As the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, said, financial services are now remarkably strong and are set to grow a lot more. I declare an interest as a director of Elmwood Design, a brand design consultancy based in Guiseley, which is growing quickly because it has an area of speciality that means that its intellectual capital is in demand around the world. A couple of years ago, it opened its first office in Australia. On good days, the other directors of Elmwood like to have the company motto as, &#147;The company from Guiseley that took on the world and won&#148;. To an extent, entrepreneurs in Leeds and in Yorkshire are taking on the world and winning, which is wholly good.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07050113000127"></a>Much has been made of the effect and impact of the universities in Leeds, York, Hull and elsewhere. I agree with my noble friend Lord Shutt that they have been key in driving forward the economy. They are huge exporters. One of my sons is currently at the University of Leeds, which is immensely attractive to middle-class young people from this part of the world. Leeds is exporting its education and people are coming to Leeds to buy it. The universities have acted a bit like self-raising flour in the economies of some of those cities by providing jobs, innovation and income with people coming in.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07050113000128"></a>There is a lot that we can be proud of in the region and there is a lot more potential. To take up the point made by my noble friend Lord Shutt about cricket, it used to be said that an England cricket team would succeed only if the Yorkshire team was succeeding, but we have had only a week of the season so far. It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that, given the size and importance of Yorkshire&#146;s economy, in order to have a successful UK economy, we need to have successful regional economies as well. We cannot rely on London to pull the whole country. Yorkshire has a major part to play.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07050113000129"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, mentioned two major areas of concern and two major constraints on the further growth of the region, and I shall return to them. The first is transport. We have heard about the problem of the low level of investment in transport. Congestion in the region, whether for commuters getting into Leeds or for freight trying to get to the Humber, is now a major constraint and imposes major costs. We need more investment.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07050113000130"></a>I, too, read Phil Woolas&#146;s comments last week. He basically said, &#147;Stop whining and sort out your own transport problems&#148;. I am afraid that that is a false hope, given the regions&#146; inability to raise their own  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_948"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 948</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>money. I hope that we and our colleagues in the other place will make representations in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review to secure more investment in transport in the Yorkshire and Humber region.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07050113000131"></a>Robin Hood Airport, in Doncaster, is a development that seems to have huge potential. It has very long runways and is in a part of the region where there is space but high unemployment. While other regions, not least those in the south, find it difficult to justify to their citizens any further growth in airports, Robin Hood is one of those rare things, an airport whose expansion is supported by virtually anybody who knows anything about it.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07050113000132"></a>The second, greater area of concern, a problem not limited to Yorkshire, is education and training. The figure for people in the region with few or no qualifications is alarming: a third of all adults. A higher than average proportion of 16 to 18 year-olds are not in education, training or employment, and there is lower than average attainment at ages 16 and 18. In West Yorkshire, within the next five years, 40 per cent of new entrants to the labour market will be of Pakistani origin, so the region has severe challenges.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07050113000133"></a>While I share the view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, about the difficulties of the Learning and Skills Council, Yorkshire Forward and the LSC have at least tried to get the bodies responsible for education and training in Yorkshire and Humber together, probably more so than in some other regions, although the figures do not reflect the extent of its success. The Learning and Skills Council, Yorkshire Forward, the Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber and the LEAs need to work hard to increase the proportion of school leavers with basic skills. We know from the chambers of commerce that over 50 per cent of businesses in Yorkshire find it difficult to recruit people with the relevant skills.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07050113000134"></a>The LSC&#146;s comments on the problems in adult education and the up-skilling of employees were very telling. In its briefing to us for this debate, it said that many employers are unwilling to spend money on employee training. It described the qualifications system as bureaucratic, complicated and not fit for purpose. The FE sector, it said, does not provide effective professional service to employers looking for courses for their staff. Those major problems, although not limited to Yorkshire, certainly constrain the region&#146;s economy.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07050113000135"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, raised the almost existential question of whether Yorkshire exists and, if so, what it means. I may not be able to answer that in the remaining two minutes of my speech. However, the paradox that exists is borne out by the <I>Yorkshire Post</I>, which has vehemently opposed any representative body for Yorkshire but whose masthead says, &#147;Yorkshire&#146;s National Newspaper&#148;. It is fighting a significant campaign, Road to Ruin, to improve transport across the region, yet it has sought to undermine any attempt to give Yorkshire a regional voice here, with the people who can decide whether money is spent on transport there.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07050113000136"></a>About a dozen bodies with Yorkshire in their title gave us briefing for this debate. With one exception, none of them is accountable to anyone and many are unknown to the population of the region. In the absence in the short to medium term of any likely degree of a regional elected body, it seems to me that Parliament and, possibly, this House, could play a part in drawing out what these bodies are doing and holding them at some level to account. I would suggest that, important though this debate has been, it has demonstrated ongoing issues relating to Yorkshire and the Humber which can be replicated to a different degree in other regions. Could your Lordships&#146; House not have a new committee of the regions which would enable us to discuss these problems in a slightly more discursive manner and help to bring the whole raft of regional bodies to account?</p>

I am also married to a Yorkshireman. Therefore, I can just about lay out my credentials for speaking in this debate, although I am bound to say that it probably will not be much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07050113000138"></a>I thank my noble friend Lady Bottomley for her contribution, which she made in her role as chancellor of Hull University. She and other speakers have nailed very firmly the educational successes in Yorkshire. The universities are spectacular and attract students from far and wide. York, Leeds and Hull are the first choice on many UCAS forms; each has its own specialities and some have an association with medicine which is very close to my heart. The educational attainments from Yorkshire which provide help across the country are very real.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07050113000139"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, sold his message extremely well. Having known Yorkshire for some time, one has seen enormous changes over the years and the change in manufacturing and industry is probably one of the most striking. I come from Northumberland, which is further north. The change from mining and the requirement to move from a very hands-on industry to a completely different way of life have probably been very painful for the people of Yorkshire and Northumberland. But they have come through, which is a remarkable aspect of the will, steel and grit in that part of the world. My father always used to say to me, &#147;You find a Yorkshireman and he&#146;ll tell you it straight: a spade is a bloody spade&#148;.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07050113000140"></a>No one has mentioned farming and agriculture in this part of the country, which is beginning to run into difficulties. There have been problems with foot and mouth and people do not want to stay in farming  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_950"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 950</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because it does not generate enough income and is a very hard life. Half the Yorkshire and Humber area, as well as my own region of Northumberland, is made up of hill farms. If they go out of business and do not exist in the future, the management of the land and of what we now know and love as the stone-walled countryside, as well as the crafts associated with agriculture on which villages depend and which bring people into the area, will be lost. I very much hope that efforts to ensure that people stay to farm are intensified. Perhaps organic farming offers hope. A lot of people are trying to develop farming and rear animals in a different way, and to do it on a smaller scale than previously. The countryside is a remarkable aspect of the region. It would be a crisis if all that farming were lost.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07050113000141"></a>I am sure that transport in the region is a nightmare. Not only are there few roads, but there is an awful lot of traffic going to an awful lot of places. The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, admitted that it was a problem. It certainly emerges from various reports on the area that something needs to be done. The A1 is still hopeless and needs more work to be done on it.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07050113000142"></a>Everybody has been very positive tonight. I therefore tread carefully in areas which are probably not quite so positive and which we ought perhaps to face up to. As I understand it, the region underperforms in employment. Unemployment has risen by nearly 1 per cent during the past year and remains a problem. The solution requires attracting industry and other employers, and skilling up local people in whatever is brought.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07050113000143"></a>Yorkshire Forward has been mentioned. I am delighted about the renaissance-market towns. Pickering is absolutely beautiful. The Catterick garrison has improved enormously. It was rather an outpost previously. My brother was based there, too. Few good stories about Catterick ever came out, but it has been an important military base for a very long time. Renaissance Market Towns is an important initiative.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07050113000144"></a>I was interested to learn that development is taking place in narrow south-east densities, which is ridiculous when one thinks of the amount of land available. People do not want to be shuttled into small-scale housing. The advantage for families of a region such as Yorkshire, once the employment is available, must be that it offers them the prospect of a house with a garden and open space in a beautiful and tranquil setting. However, as with everywhere else, I imagine that house prices in the region are going up and that, as elsewhere, the people who want to live and work in the area will find it extremely difficult to remain, although where else they are meant to go, after everybody has been pushed down to the south-east, is becoming quite a conundrum.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07050113000145"></a>An interim report of the Small Business Task Force, which was set up by my party, found, rather alarmingly, that more than 33 per cent of funding is lost in operating costs as the money is channelled through the regional development agencies. It is well known in this House that I am not keen on regional government and not wholly keen on the RDAs, but if the figure that I have been given is correct, it is worth pointing it out. If that amount of money is lost

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07050113000146"></a>The debate has been excellent. It conjures up such wonderful visions in one&#146;s mind. One can only hope that Yorkshire and Humber continues to develop in the way that it has. It has such good advocates in this House. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, again for giving us an illuminating debate.</p>

While listening to noble Lords this evening, I have been trying to think of how I could present my Yorkshire credentials. The only ones that I can offer are that I was married in Guisborough and my husband&#146;s family live in North Yorkshire. I spend quite a bit of time in Marske-by-the-Sea.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07050113000148"></a>I, too, congratulate my noble friend Lord Woolmer on securing this debate, which I see as further evidence of his outstanding and long-standing commitment to promoting the interests of the people of Yorkshire and Humber. I welcome the opportunity to discuss what assessment the Government have made of the contribution of Yorkshire and Humber to the United Kingdom economy.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07050113000149"></a>In preparing for this debate, I was particularly struck by the success of Yorkshire Forward, which has been referred to many times this evening. This is a good place to begin my remarks. I would like to pay tribute to Yorkshire Forward and its regional partners for working so hard and so closely together to produce and deliver the Yorkshire and Humber regional economic strategy. It is notable that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, who is in his place this evening, may even have kicked off the process when he chaired the conference, Shaping the Agenda, in Huddersfield in February 2005, where the regional partners met for the first time to consider key issues for the review of the Yorkshire and Humber RES.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07050113000150"></a>I am delighted that this revised strategy, which was launched last year, was endorsed by my right honourable friend Margaret Hodge MP on behalf of the Government. What a positive assessment this must be from the Government of the contribution that Yorkshire and Humber can make to the UK economy. I believe that the RES is unique in at least two respects. First, it is the only regional economic strategy that includes costings for its proposals. That is to be particularly welcomed. Yorkshire Forward undertook a detailed analysis which concluded that more than &#163;100 billion in public expenditure will be spent in Yorkshire and Humber over five years through to 2010.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07050113000151"></a>The independent performance assessment on Yorkshire Forward published by the National Audit Office last month highlighted the importance of this and noted that the costing analysis makes a valuable contribution to Yorkshire Forward's strategic leadership role. It will help the regional development agency (RDA) to,</p>
<ul><a name="07050113000181"></a>&#147;co-ordinate activities of partners and funding bodies to achieve common aims&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_952"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 952</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07050113000164"></a>Yorkshire Forward is setting an example to the rest of the UK.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07050113000152"></a>Secondly, it has a truly inspirational quality exemplified by the inclusion of a poem. It is the only RES with a poem dedicated to it. The poem <I>Northlands </I>is by Joolz Denby, a professional writer who lives and works in Bradford and is obviously passionate about her home in Yorkshire and Humber. I recommend that noble Lords add the poem to their reading list.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07050113000153"></a>However, the Government share the optimism of the regional partners that the Yorkshire and Humber economy is heading in the right direction and the optimism that noble Lords have expressed tonight. We support the vision in the regional economic strategy of Yorkshire and Humber as a great place to live, work and do business. In the seven years since the first Yorkshire and Humber RES was produced, there have been positive outcomes in the region. The economy has achieved faster growth than its European competitors and unemployment in the region is at its lowest consistent point for 30 years&#151;something that I am sure noble Lords will welcome. The economy contributed &#163;55 billion to UK productivity in 1999 and today the Yorkshire and Humber economy produces &#163;75 billion.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07050113000154"></a>As we have heard, the region has gained new businesses and jobs in industries such as digital media as well as in the thriving financial sector in the Leeds city region. Leeds University, an establishment well known and championed by my noble friend Lord Woolmer himself, has played a key role in helping businesses benefit from the world-class academic research and development support as part of the Centre of Industrial Collaboration network. The noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, has already spoken most eloquently of the contribution of the University of Hull.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07050113000155"></a>As I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, is aware through his close connections with Calderdale, the area is well placed to benefit from continued growth in the Leeds city region. It is estimated that that region will create a further 65,000 new jobs by 2015. As he said, however, it is not all about Leeds. As the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, stressed, York is also well placed to create jobs in growth sectors. Since it began in 1997, the Science City York initiative has created 3,000 new jobs. Over 9,000 jobs in York are now in science-related activities. As the noble Baroness suggested, that growth represents the growing international reputation of the University of York, working closely with existing businesses and potential entrepreneurs. I am delighted that it is also promoting the role of women.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07050113000156"></a>As my noble friend Lord Haskel pointed out, the region has been able to build on the past to create hope for the future. Sheffield city region retains its status as a strong manufacturing base and, as we heard, that is no longer dominated by traditional or old-fashioned methods of production that are vulnerable in a fast-moving, competitive, global economy.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07050113000157"></a>The Government recognise the importance of the Humber ports as the global gateway for UK businesses. That is why the Government announced earlier this  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_953"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 953</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>year an investment of over &#163;60 million to improve rail connections to the Humber ports. The Government will continue to work closely with the regional development agency and regional partners to realise the vision of Yorkshire and Humber as a great place to work and do business. Both the Government and the regional partners recognise the importance of skills, as noble Lords mentioned, to the future prosperity of Yorkshire and Humber.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07050113000158"></a>Noble Lords are aware of the importance of focusing almost &#163;30 billion of the estimated &#163;100 billion total public investment through to 2010 on helping people to develop the skills needed by businesses and employers. Government and regional partners also share a common agenda in wanting to connect people to good jobs, and I mean good jobs. Almost &#163;50 billion over the next five years is allocated to that aim in the RES. It is vital that we work together to connect people to these good jobs, particularly those from more deprived communities. Therefore, I am pleased that Yorkshire and Humber has done well in securing &#163;90 million over the next three years from the local enterprise growth initiative. This resource will help partners to target deprived communities in Bradford, Leeds, Sheffield, Doncaster and north-east Lincolnshire to unlock enterprise potential in these areas, something I am sure noble Lords will welcome. The importance of this was stressed today by the publication of the Joseph Rowntree report that I am sure noble Lords will have heard about. The Government are clear that we must avoid a two-speed economy developing in Yorkshire and Humber where prosperity and poverty sit alongside each other. This would not achieve the vision of Yorkshire and Humber as a great place to work, live and do business in.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07050113000159"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, said, transport is key. I know this view is shared by my honourable friend Phil Woolas from another place. Transport affects business success, quality of life and the environment. Good transport links are a key component of the government agenda for a prosperous and socially just society. We should not underestimate the task of creating a transport system that meets the needs of a successful economy, as the noble Baroness has already reminded us. It takes time and requires sustained investment. The Government will be spending &#163;155 billion on  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_954"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column 954</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>transport over the coming years to 2015. Government spending on transport in Yorkshire and Humber has increased more in percentage terms over six years to 2006-07 than in any other region; it has increased threefold to nearly &#163;500 million.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07050113000160"></a>In conclusion, both government and regional partners are right to be optimistic that the Yorkshire and Humber economy is heading in the right direction. We clearly face new challenges: the need to ensure that increasing prosperity and opportunity benefits all locations and communities across the region, including those rural communities so passionately described; the importance of developing and updating skills which are vital in a modern, competitive, global economy, encouraging innovation in both products and processes to maintain our competitive edge; and the need to balance economic growth with protecting and enhancing the environment. There are no easy solutions, no quick fixes. Government and regional partners must work together to deliver priorities in Yorkshire and Humber and to deliver the RES. This is not just another strategy document; it is a road map showing how partners can achieve high-quality sustainable growth with long-term benefits to people, business and the environment in Yorkshire and Humber.</p>

<a name="70430-0013.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07050113000161"></a>My noble friend Lord Woolmer raised a question about housing density. The Yorkshire and Humber housing strategy aims to deliver the right supply and range of housing in the right location to support economic growth and urban regeneration. I am very interested in the points that he has raised about density. I will look into this myself and write to him on that question. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has raised a question about the flow of moneys through RDAs and I will look into that and get back to her in more detail as time will not allow now.</p>

There has been a slight error in the grouping of amendments. Amendment No. 18, which is presently grouped with Amendment No. 12, should actually be in the group beginning with Amendment No. 14. If your Lordships are content, I suggest that we consider it in that group.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000008"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 1 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

However, my eye was caught by the provisions of Clause 1, and I find myself astonished that both Houses of Parliament appear to be settling down to pass without comment a provision that enables the Mayor and Members of the London Assembly to decide on their own severance remuneration when even Members of your Lordships' House have their remuneration or recompense, such as it is, settled by an independent body.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000010"></a>In an age when the public increasingly want the transparency and assurance of public finance being administered independently, it seems to me quite extraordinarily out of touch with our times that this clause should be put in the Bill without even contention. I did not want that to happen, and I make the comment, as an independent Conservative Back-Bench voice&#151;I am not voicing my party's policy&#151;that this is entirely wrong. If we were able to divide, I would be precipitating a Division at the end of this discussion, were I not satisfied, as I do not expect to be, by what the Minister is about to tell us.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000011"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0705019000171"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> It is always a pleasure to welcome the noble Lord, however fleetingly, to the debate. I hope that I can reassure him. As he pointed out, Clause 1 enables the Mayor of London and the London Assembly to set up and administer schemes that allow elected Members of the authority to receive a payment when they cease to hold office.  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Such a scheme can be established only if the Mayor and the Assembly act together to agree to establish it.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000012"></a>Far from being out of touch, this clause brings the GLA into line with other similar bodies. It is also a question of fairness and prudence, as I hope to show. There is currently no provision to allow the GLA to provide a payment to an elected Member who ceases to hold office, although it can provide pension arrangements when elected Members leave. This change, therefore, brings the GLA into line, first, with the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, and, secondly, with the 2005 recommendation from the Senior Salaries Review Body, which proposed that a severance scheme should be introduced for the Mayor and Assembly Members. This is not something that we have invented or that the GLA has pushed for in a cavalier fashion.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000013"></a>If the GLA chooses to set up a scheme, that scheme must be funded from its existing resources, and it will guarantee a transparent process. Therefore, the GLA will have to look prudently at what this will mean for finances, because it should not increase the council tax; we would not want to see that. This is fair and we hope very much that it is respected as the GLA grows and matures; it is a reflection of that growth. As I said, the change is made very properly, in relation to Scotland and Wales, and on the advice of the SSRB.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000014"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0705019000172"></a>Lord Elton:</b> Before the noble Baroness sits down, may I ask her to elucidate? She says that this must be funded from existing resources&#151;here, I declare an interest as a council tax payer in Greater London&#151;and that costs will not fall on the council tax payer. What existing resources does she have in mind?</p>

<p><a name="0705019000015"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0705019000173"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I cannot extrapolate from what I have said, because this will depend on the sort of scheme that the GLA chooses to establish. However, the precedent of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly might be useful, as they have used the level of resettlement grant payment. The figure has been calculated as a percentage of annual salary determined by age and length of service. We have some parameters there. Clearly, the result will depend on whether the GLA chooses to do this, but I reiterate that we do not expect or want to see any increase in council tax.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000016"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0705019000174"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I start by declaring the interest that I declared on Second Reading, which is a particularly large one in this connection: I am a serving Member of the London Assembly who, by choice, is not proposing to stand again. As a result, I may become entitled to a payment under whatever scheme is put in place. I well accept that there are distinctions between the different histories of Members and the ways in which different Members may lose office. The Mayor and the Assembly may well wish to consider that point when the time comes.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000017"></a>I know that my noble friend Lord Tope will want to declare the same interest and, so that it is all on the record, I will do it for him.</p>

That is no different from what happens with the remuneration for Assembly Members and, indeed, for the Mayor. Historically, the Assembly and Mayor have followed recommendations made by the Senior Salaries Review Body. The recommendations are therefore made by a third party, but the decisions are matters for the GLA, and the arrangements for the severance scheme will be no different.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000020"></a>As the Minister explained, this was a recommendation by the SSRB, which assessed the jobs of Assembly Members and&#151;less surprisingly, perhaps&#151;the Mayor as being full time. Your Lordships may want to consider issues relating to the position of local authority cabinet members, whose jobs are increasingly becoming full time. Perhaps this provision is leading the way on that, but it certainly has not sprung from any action taken by the GLA. As my noble friend Lord Tope whispered to me a minute ago, it would be much more comfortable if the scheme were simply imposed on us, rather than our having to take the decisions. I hope that that has fleshed out the position a little.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000021"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0705019000177"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> Perhaps I, too, should declare an interest, on the off-chance that the Mayor and the Assembly should make this payment retrospective to cover former Members who lost their position.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000022"></a>First, I believe that the proposal is consistent with what applies for a number of other public bodies, certainly in local government, where payments are determined by the local authority on the basis, usually, of independent advice. That seems to be the basis on which this should be done.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000023"></a>My second point goes back to my personal experience. When people hold an office on the basis that it is full time and remunerated as such, the loss of office, particularly when it is unexpected and unplanned for, will have a dramatic effect on them. In most other areas of life, there are arrangements for that to be managed, and I would have thought that that was behind the Senior Salary Review Body's recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000027"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment is unfinished business as regards the previous Greater London Authority Act and I pick it up on that basis. One should make it clear whether one is speaking about the current Mayor or the system. There are difficult crossovers, where either the impact of the current Mayor or that of the system itself has made   


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the tabling of amendments necessary. I should make it clear that I am talking here about the system, not the current Mayor. However, it seems to me an appropriate starting point for our wider consideration of the Bill and, in particular, the role of the London boroughs in the government of the capital. Our approach to the Bill is to oppose provisions that centralise too much influence with the Mayor and, as here, to balance as far as possible the power of the boroughs.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000029"></a>It is striking that the boroughs are not included among the primary bodies that the Mayor must consult. This amendment would rectify that position. It would include the body that represents the boroughs&#151;namely, London Councils&#151;and thus put it on an equal footing with the London Assembly as regards consultation. That is an important principle. It would be wrong for the Mayor not to take into account the views of the body of local authorities, London Councils, when devising or consulting on his strategies.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000030"></a>There are a number of reasons why we believe this to be the case. First, with equal democratic legitimacy, the boroughs would add an extra level of scrutiny to the Mayor's strategies. More pertinently, the councils themselves will be charged with carrying out the Mayor's strategies and ensuring that his duties are met. Therefore, to cut them out of the primary consultation process for those very strategies appears unjust. My honourable friends in another place, as well as many others outside Westminster, have raised legitimate concerns about the range of some of the Mayor's strategies elsewhere in the Bill. An easy way for the Government to allay some of these fears would be to ensure that the London boroughs had an explicit stake in the consultation process before these strategies are published.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000031"></a>This amendment would help to entrench the Government's original vision of the Mayor as someone who should perform only a strategic role. It would not add any powers to London Councils but would give that body a voice. We hope that the Government will respond favourably to this suggestion. The Minister in another place argued that this was an unnecessary change as such consultation ought to take place in any event. If that is the case, there can be no possible argument against formalising the relationship. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000032"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="0705019000179"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> It is important that the Mayor should have regard to the views of London Councils&#151;I wish that that body was still called the ALG, because that would have made this debate a great deal easier. The Mayor should have particular regard to the views of each London council. I distinguish them from London Councils, which cannot always represent all views and, indeed, is likely on some occasions to represent a majority view. What is important is the breadth of the consultation and what is meant in this clause by &#147;have regard to&#148; views. I do not know whether the Minister can assist me; I am not sure what more is meant by "have regard to" than is inherent in good consultation. However, that is not the central point of this amendment.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000033"></a>Individual borough councils are consulted on strategies&#151;or should be&#151;under the original Act. The Section 42 list includes &#147;each London borough council&#148;. I recall a debate in 1998 or 1999 about whether the Association of London Government, as it then called itself, should be included separately in that list-the converse, perhaps, of this debate. So the boroughs are consulted.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000034"></a>Most important are the provisions in the new section headed &#147;Consultation: supplementary provision&#148;. Those provisions are not the whole of it, by any means; they merely supplement Section 42. Subsections (2), (4), (5) and (6) spell out what the Mayor has to do in responding to comments made through a consultation process. He has to give reasons why comments are accepted or rejected, or, presumably&#151;although it does not say so&#151;why they are partly accepted or rejected. I see that feedback as important part of the process.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000035"></a>I do not suppose that London Councils, the organisation, would sit back during this period, but I think that the individual boroughs have a particular status in that part of the forest. This clause, in particular, would strengthen the role of the Assembly and its scrutiny powers by requiring the Mayor to spell out precisely why he does or does not accept comments made by the Assembly in contributing to the making of a strategy.</p>

However, if one adds the boroughs to the consultation, it raises the question of whom else one might add to the consultation. I should just say that I am chief executive of London First, which is a business organisation. I believe that the London business community would be another obvious stakeholder to consult.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000037"></a>I wonder why the provision includes the &#147;functional bodies&#148;, as it would seem a little odd if the Mayor did not have regard to his own functional bodies when developing strategies. I wholly endorse the view that he should have regard to the Assembly, as critiquing the strategies is core to its role. I also support the important point about transparency over why certain points in the consultation have or have not been taken on board, which is referred to in a later amendment. That is a more important provision than the one that we are currently considering.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000038"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="0705019000181"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss consultation, because it is so important. I am also grateful to the noble Baroness for making the distinction between the Mayor as a person and the Mayor as an office.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000039"></a>We all agree about the importance of public bodies engaging in proper, meaningful consultation as they develop their strategies. That is a crucial role in the process of making policy. I am very grateful that the noble Baronesses, Lady Hanham and Lady Valentine, have drawn attention to the strengthening that we have offered in Clause 2. The GLA Act obviously placed a very wide range of duties on the Mayor in  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>terms of consultation. Clause 2 takes the argument and opportunity for the GLA significantly further by these additional powers.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000040"></a>The provision strengthens the requirement on the Mayor to have an explicit regard to consultation processes. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked me about that. The key is the explicit &#147;have regard to&#148;. That is tied in with the requirement on the Mayor to write to the Assembly in responding to any recommendation that it makes explaining his reasons for not accepting it. That is an incredibly valuable power and I am glad that the GLA has welcomed it.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000041"></a>At the moment the Mayor must carry out two stages of consultation on his strategies. That is deliberately so, because a proper distinction has been made between the GLA family, which he consults at the first stage&#151;the Assembly and functional bodies that he consults on drafts for or revisions to strategies&#151;before moving on to consult more widely at the second stage. He is specifically required to consult the London boroughs during the second stage. This is where the consultation carries more force, given the breadth of experience in delivery offered by the London boroughs. We think that the two-stage process works well by allowing the Mayor to take full account of views within the family, as it were, before consulting outside.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000042"></a>The amendment would require the Mayor to have regard to comments made by any representative body of the London boroughs, such as London Councils, when he consults on his strategies. For the reasons I have just given, we cannot accept it. Such bodies make an important contribution to the development of strategies at the second stage, after the Mayor has consulted the Assembly and the functional bodies. Taking fully into account the responses made in consultation is an important new requirement in the sense that the Mayor has to respond explicitly and transparently; indeed, he has a firm track record of adjusting his proposals in response.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000043"></a>My final argument has already been made by the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, who said that, if one allows the London councils to have a role at the primary stage, one would need to ask who else might legitimately come forward speaking for London interests and say, &#147;Why not us?&#148;. The body so ably represented by the noble Baroness is London First, but that would not be the end of it. We would be opening up the first stage to another raft of potential consultees and thus diluting the distinction that we want to make between the GLA family in the first instance and the second stage of consultation. So, with regret, I have to resist the amendment.</p>

London Councils is the body that represents the democratically elected local authorities. London First, great as that organisation is&#151;I used to be on its board&#151;does a completely different job; it does not represent elected bodies. London Councils does, and every single action taken by the Mayor has an impact on local authorities. He is going to impact either on their

That represents an impact on aspects of the daily life of London that the Mayor does not implement, because the London councils, in their plurality, do.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000045"></a>This is a unique situation. The Assembly is elected but does not have representatives from every council in London. Given how the constituencies fall, there may not necessarily be one Assembly Member for each borough. That is why this is so important. I appreciate that at the second stage the London boroughs are consulted, but at the first stage, which represents the first understanding of the policy and strategies, it seems perfectly appropriate that the body which represents the London boroughs and which has on it representatives from each of them should be involved in the consultation and be able to give the Mayor its view. Indeed, it should be in the same position; that is, it should be able to require a written response to its representations.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000046"></a>I hope that the Minister will rethink this point in the light of my remarks, because London Councils is now an important and serious body of representatives of local government and the Mayor cannot replicate it in other ways. The consultation policy should be formulated so that London Councils becomes an authorised consultee at the outset. I do not know whether I am going to move the Minister now, but in view of my own argument&#151;with which I am becoming more and more compelled even as I speak&#151;I am bound to say that it is likely that I shall return to this matter at a later stage.

That was most colourfully demonstrated by the polling for the extension of the congestion charge. In that regard, I declare an interest as a member of the council of the Royal Borough of Kensington and

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000050"></a>Although a staggering proportion of local residents objected to the expansion of the congestion charge, the Mayor paid not the slightest heed. It is unacceptable to us that the Mayor can gain political capital by announcing that there will be formal consultation but subsequently turning an apparently completely deaf ear to the views expressed. The accusation that the Mayor pays lip-service to the idea of consultation but that the outcome has no bearing on his final decision is hard to shake off. It must be in the Mayor's interest that such accusations can be refuted. It is essential for the office of Mayor that the public can have confidence in the process behind decision-making; and it must be in the public interest that Londoners have the opportunity to voice their opinions and know that they will be listened to and not patronised.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000051"></a>It is against that background we propose that a consultation strategy should be produced. Various other strategies are coming up in the Bill, so this would just add one more. The strategy would set down clearly and indisputably the procedure for any future consultation. It would specify the individuals or bodies that ought to be consulted and the transparency of such consultation as well as the time frames, publicity and the right to participation. Those are all vital considerations that the Mayor should not be allowed to sidestep. The Government's position cannot seriously be to endorse rushed or poorly publicised consultations or ones with no realistic opportunity for participation, or to encourage a situation where a clearly relevant body is unnecessarily omitted.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000052"></a>We are not imposing restrictions; it would be the Mayor himself who would produce the strategy. That would have the advantage not only of ensuring that each consultation was procedurally correct and, importantly, consistent but, as the strategy would have to be published, the process of consultation as envisaged by the Mayor would be openly understood at all stages and open to challenge.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000057"></a>To suggest, however, that the mere presence of a consultation strategy will mean that a Mayor&#151;any Mayor&#151;is going to agree with the views expressed is clearly wrong. The purpose of consultation is to extend to the public, or to those being consulted, an opportunity to comment. It is incumbent on the person consulting to listen and consider those views. Ultimately, though, it is the responsibility of&#151;in this case&#151;the Mayor to make a judgment in the light of the views that have been expressed and of the view of the public interest that that person takes. That may sometimes mean going against the heavily expressed views from a particular area, because there is seen to be a wider benefit. A consultation strategy will not ensure that that does not happen; indeed, it should not do so. The whole purpose of electing people to hold office in public life is for them to exercise their judgment and subsequently to be held accountable for that judgment. Of course they should consult and of course they should listen and take note, but that does not mean that, because a majority of views expressed go against a particular policy, that policy should automatically be reversed.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000059"></a>Of course there should be a strategy, or maybe several strategies. The noble Lord said jokingly that there may be a series of them, but in fact different policy strategies require different forms of consultation and different exercises. I did not think in time to look this up, but I believe that there are Cabinet Office guidelines on this subject, which I suppose provide for a minimum of what is good consultation and how one deals with it. The Minister may be able to tell us about that.</p>

The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that the authority publishes consultation responses, the analysis of those responses and any reasons why representations that have been received have been disregarded.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000064"></a>The new amendments are straightforward. They are about openness, transparency, and providing additional checks and balances. Although this would not stop the Mayor proceeding with his strategies, such as the congestion charge extension, it would make clear the reasons why he had rejected second representations. It would also make clearer the opposition to his proposals, as in the case of the most recent congestion charge extension, and would provide much more public awareness of it. Requiring the Mayor to make publicly available the analysis, the responses and the reasons why he should act is another significant check and balance, which is required when we are talking about giving the Mayor additional powers. It would therefore be entirely appropriate to introduce additional checks and balances to ensure that his powers are exercised sensibly.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000065"></a>As I said, the amendment is simple, straightforward and clear. It would make publicly available much more information about consultation and the Mayor's reasons for accepting or rejecting responses to his proposals. Surely the Minister agrees that it is completely illogical that the Mayor and the Greater London Authority will be able to do things differently from any other local authority in England.</p>

We have all been in public life and local authority life for many, many years. Over the years, I have, as a chairman and a leader, had to give the outcome of consultations. Sometimes they were received well and sometimes they were not, but that is the name of the game. It would be new to me if the words used in the amendment assuaged feelings about an outcome with which we disagreed, because when people fully participate in a consultation and express a view, they rarely accept that the logic of what they have said has been considered carefully but rejected.

Someone may listen to another, opposing point of view but stick to his original point of view. He has not been moved. That does not mean that the other's point of view has been ignored. The painful fact is that you win some, you lose some; so I will be interested to hear the Minister's view of the amendment and whether it would eventually strengthen the general view that there should be the widest possible consultation.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000067"></a>It is right that there should be a strategy and an understanding. It is also right that the Mayor should accept responsibility for explaining in public and in consultation what moves the policy, but we will get nowhere by using a form of words that would make the Mayor bound to do certain things. The Mayor, of course, has powers, and provided that what he is asked to do within those powers is democratic and sensible, I have no objection to them.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000073"></a>I was involved in a discussion with a residents' association in Westminster for three months. I did much of the work on the half of the residents' association and I found the process of consultation with the GLA extremely difficult to understand. There was no master document. My son and I spent hours trawling the internet to find out how to make representations on particular issues. The information was not there unless you dug deep into the detail and looked at individual documents produced by the GLA on planning policy. Although the amendment may seem redundant to some of my noble friends, if it would provide for a single document that would set

As someone who tried to use the system and work out what were the rights for a council tax payer in London to make representations and be consulted, if they are as difficult as I suggest, something should be done.</p>

My noble friend has already declared my interest as a Member of the London Assembly. Through that, I am also a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority. Entirely unrelated to that, I am also a London borough councillor.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000075"></a>I have much sympathy with the wording of the amendment. It is a statement of good practice. It is a useful statement. I would hope and expect that every consultation would provide that information before it began. I fear that, all too often, that does not happen. As my noble friend said, I am less sure that we could have one strategy that covers every consultation in whatever circumstances. Rather, we should have a statement of good practice at the start of each consultation.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000076"></a>I am a little more concerned about some of the things that have been said in this short debate that seemed fundamentally to misunderstand the purpose of consultation. Consultation is not and is never intended to be a referendum. It may well be&#151;it often is&#151;that the greater number of responses comes from people against the proposal being consulted on. That is the nature of life. That does not necessarily mean that the decision taker has to abide by the weight of response. The purpose of consultation is to enable the decision-taker or takers to make better-informed decisions and weigh up all the pros and cons.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000077"></a>I do not want to go too far with this particular example, but I and my party happened to oppose the extension to the congestion charge. However, in considering that, the Mayor should have taken into account the interests of London as a whole, not just a particular area. The point of consultation is that it should better inform decision-takers. It should not be a referendum. The other point is that the word consultation is sometimes used too loosely to mean communication.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000078"></a>In any consultation we should be clear what is up with options for change, for variation or even for rejection and what is not. I am not sure whether it is legally possible for the Mayor to have done this in the example we were using, but let me use it as an example. The Mayor was clearly minded, rightly or wrongly, to extend the congestion charge. It would probably have been better if he had made that absolutely clear to start with and if he had had a consultation not on whether he should do it, but on how he should do it, and the details of how it should work. Whether that was legally possible is, in a way, irrelevant to the argument I am making.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>

I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Harris for opening it so widely and forensically and for the views expressed around the Committee.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000081"></a>A distinction is to be drawn about what we want from good consultation and good communication processes. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, made a very helpful point. So much of what has been said could be achieved by improved processes and improved communication strategies. That might address the point raised by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. But that is not what this amendment is about or what it would achieve. There are clearly issues that we hope the Mayor will listen to closely, and it will be fascinating as the ways of the Greater London Assembly are unveiled before us in Committee. Clearly, there are ways of doing things and it is very interesting to know, for example, that there are internal communication and consultation strategies.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000082"></a>The amendment would require the Mayor to prepare a consultation strategy, which would include, among other things, his procedures for consultation, persons to be consulted and arrangements for publicity and public participation. That is extremely prescriptive without being able to guarantee&#151;setting aside the debate that we have just had on outcomes&#151;that the processes would be better. That is why I think we have to resist it.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000083"></a>I take the point made by my noble friend Lady Turner. We do not lightly put bits of legislation into force, either because they are redundant because they are achieved by other means, or because we feel like it. If I had said that we can just add another strategy to the many strategies we are adding in, I think that the noble Baroness would have looked askance at me. Obviously, we want everything that goes into the Bill to serve its precise purpose.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000084"></a>Although the amendment has provoked a very useful debate, it would do nothing more than add to the bureaucratic burden. It has the capacity to be time-consuming and costly, and I do not think that it will bring about any improved processes. It certainly would not guarantee any more favourable outcomes in terms of any expectations that anyone might have.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000085"></a>I can see that one of the recurring debates that we will have is about the congestion charge and who will listen to whom. My sense is that when the Mayor decided to go ahead with the western extension of the congestion charge following public consultation, the exact nature of the zone and treatment of discounts were significantly modified in the light of consultation responses. So I do not think we can take that as read. Indeed, I could and probably would give different examples at different times of our debate. Also, I do not think it is true that the Mayor ignores the views of consultees, not least because he has already published summaries of public consultation processes on a voluntary basis for several statutory strategies.</p>

If an ordinary mortal citizen of London faced some complication and wanted to know what the role of the Mayor was in terms of consultation and which bodies had to be consulted, where would he look? Is there a rule book somewhere? Is there something published which he could find or which is made available whereby he would know exactly what actions he should take and how to proceed?</p>

I take the point the noble Lord makes, but I do not think that will be solved by the amendment. Clearly there are issues around how to access information about how to take part in a consultation process. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, said that much of what is being proposed might serve well as the preamble to any consultation process or paper; such a preamble could give this information. That is a matter for the Mayor.</p>

She said that people should refer to the Act. The kind of people I am talking about have probably never handled an Act in all their lives; they probably do not even know what one looks like, and would not know where to find it. They would not know that you could get it in a public library, and if they went to a library they would probably have difficulty getting access to it. They would probably have to go to HMSO, although they probably would not know what that was anyhow. The point is whether a simple source of information is available. That was what happened during our argument with the GLA; no one knew what the rules were and how to proceed.</p>

I accept the difficulties there are in accessing legislation, and I do not have a complete answer for that. My instinct would have been to suggest that the Mayor's office should be rung and discussions had directly with his staff who are there to inform the public about access. We know that the Mayor is open and that he takes the process of democratic engagement very seriously&#151;and I would have thought that was a place to start. I will write to the noble Lord, because he is making an important point.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000090"></a>A question was asked about the nature of consultation and what guidance there may be on it. Cabinet Office guidance is issued on consultation processes. Although those are essentially government processes, the guidance creates a framework of expectation about what should go into making a thorough and meaningful consultation. That is a useful framework in itself.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000091"></a>I reiterate that I appreciate the opportunity to have this debate, but I am afraid we cannot accept the noble Baroness's amendment.</p>

There is no question that this consultation should take place with anyone else. There is no suggestion there that there should be a consultation process for discussing and conducting a consultation with&#151;good gracious&#151;members of the public, the electors who are affected. There is nothing in the clause that widens the process out to the public.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000093"></a>I used the congestion charge as an example simply because it still rankles, firmly and squarely, in my borough. Yes, modifications were made, but they were marginal and simply stopped people being trapped in a no-man's-land. So there were reasons behind that.</p>

Is it not also the case that there have been a number of legal cases about whether or not consultation has taken place properly? I refer the noble Baroness to the case of Agricultural, Horticultural and Forestry Industry Training Board v Aylesbury Mushrooms in 1972, heard by Lord Justice Donaldson, which set out clearly that,</p>
<ul><a name="0705019000162"></a>&#147;the essence of consultation is the communication of a genuine invitation, extended with a receptive mind, to give advice&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0705019000131"></a>or to a case that both of us probably remember more directly: R v Secretary of State for Social Services ex parte Association of Metropolitan Authorities in 1986, where Lord Justice Webster said,</p>
<ul><a name="0705019000163"></a>&#147;in any context, the essence of consultation is the communication of a genuine invitation to give advice and a genuine consideration of that advice&#148;.</ul>

Indeed, I was interested in the account of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, of his experience of trying to access anything to do with finding out about the strategies of the Greater London Authority. The validity of consultation is accepted by the public if they know what it is about, what is happening, and why. I cited the introduction of the congestion charge as an example of how things should not be done, whatever the outcome. It would therefore be extremely helpful to have a proper

In relation to the question of requiring the Mayor to consult with the general public, I should like to put on the record the fact that, under Section 42 of the Greater London Assembly Act 1999, the Mayor should, before he implements a major area of policy, consult the Assembly and the functional bodies first, and in consulting more widely&#151;including the London boroughs&#151;he must also consult any other body that he considers appropriate.

The amendment would assist the Assembly in planning its business so that no consultation is sprung on it. Subsection (3) is to provide for feedback. Increasingly, I realise how important it is that there is an organised method of a consultor recording how and why a decision was taken and what the response is to consultees. That cannot always be done on an individual basis, but it is important for public authorities to set out extremely clearly and accessibly, taking that point, why they take a decision.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000108"></a>This is proposed as a new clause after Clause 2. It is not intended to diminish consultation undertaken under the new provisions, which are very specific about the Assembly's role, or to suggest that Section 42 of the 1999 Act is in any way diminished. Taking the points that have just been made on the previous amendment, if I thought that Clause 2 in any way diminished Section 42, I would be very concerned indeed.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000109"></a>No doubt in a moment the noble Baroness will speak to her Amendment No. 71, which requires that mayoral strategies be subject to the Assembly's approval. While again I have sympathy with the notion, from this side we have pretty much accepted that this Bill does not fundamentally change the structure of the GLA and the executive/scrutiny split. For the Assembly to be able to veto strategies&#151;there have been occasions when I have wished that we could&#151;it would probably need a more thorough revision of the 1999 Act. Over the years, it has been suggested, particularly by academics, that the Assembly might be given the opportunity to veto mayoral strategies on the basis of a two-thirds majority and that that would be in practice rather more useful than the two-thirds majority that is required to block the budget. Many members of the public think that the Assembly has the power to block the Mayor, but that is not the case. My main concern about Amendment No. 71 is that, whatever we end up

<p><a name="0705019000111"></a>It seems to us that any strategy that the Mayor puts forward has to have some approval from someone. He is quite on his own up there, and it makes sense that, if you have an Assembly that you can consult and make sure that it thinks that something is a good idea, that should be what happens. Even if it happens in the breach at the moment, perhaps it ought to happen with a bit more authority.</p>

To reiterate, Clause 2 strengthens further the requirements on the Mayor to respond to consultation on his strategies. In future, he will be subject to an explicit duty to have regard to any comments from the Assembly and the functional bodies in response to consultation. He must also respond in writing to the Assembly to any recommendation that it makes, explaining his reasons. We believe very strongly&#151;I sense that the Committee does, too&#151;that this change will sharpen up the Assembly's contribution to policy development, and sharpen and deepen its influence. It will, for example, be much more transparent where the Mayor agrees with the Assembly's view and where, and why, he does not. The Assembly itself has said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0705019000153"></a>&#147;This will strengthen the Assembly's role in the development of the Mayor's strategies, by introducing a greater degree of transparency into the process by which the Mayor considers the Assembly's comments and makes decisions on the contents of his strategies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000113"></a>These are sensible, incremental changes. I was very grateful for the way in which the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, explained the importance of the distinction in the mayoral role model between the scrutiny function of the Assembly and the executive arm&#151;the Mayor&#151;and why the Mayor should have the final say over the content of his strategies.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000114"></a>Do Amendments Nos. 3 and 71 improve the processes? I reluctantly conclude that they do not. I shall discuss Amendment No. 71 first. I agree entirely with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that it would not only blur the clear lines of responsibility that were laid down in the Act and that work well, but overturn the settlement between the Assembly and the Mayor. We believe very strongly that preparation and the revision of strategies is clearly an executive function in the GLA model, and is rightly the responsibility of the mayor. The Assembly's primary and legitimate role should be to scrutinise content and implementation, while also being able to recommend to the Mayor how they might be improved. That is why we have strengthened the Assembly's powers in this regard; namely, to expect answers when its recommendations have not been accepted.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000115"></a>Amendment No. 71 would completely overturn the requirement on the Assembly to approve mayoral strategies. The Mayor would have to seek Assembly approval. The very least that the amendment would do would be to add confusion and uncertainty about the Mayor's policies about what would survive and what would be in the interests of London. It would be much more difficult for an elected Mayor to implement his manifesto commitments, which Londoners have elected him to deliver. I am therefore afraid that we resist the amendment.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000116"></a>We also resist Amendment No. 3, which would require the Mayor to notify the Chair of the Assembly of any consultation that he intends to undertake on the use of the authority's general power. It would also require the Mayor to publish a statement about the responses to consultation before implementing any proposals. I understood the noble Baroness to say that there was no problem with the large, formal consultations and that she was more concerned about the smaller, more informal ones. That, however, is exactly where the problem lies. The amendment would create a cumbersome, bureaucratic and costly procedure that would not improve the authority's efficiency. The Mayor is already required to consult bodies or persons whom he considers appropriate before exercising the GLA's general power. Quite rightly, however, this is not necessarily a formal process. It might be a meeting with interested parties or a series of phone calls. We have entered into very difficult definitions here. Requiring the Mayor to notify the Assembly each time he does so and, even more onerously, requiring him to produce a written statement setting out each response that he accepts and each response that he does not is impractical and unworkable.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000117"></a>The noble Baroness raised the question of what is good practice in this field and what is an exceptional request. This goes well beyond accepted good practice, because when the Secretary of State responds to a consultation, he is required to publish a summary of responses to each formal consultation. I understand that that is also the standard practice of the Mayor. To require him to publish a statement on all responses to all types of consultation on his general power is excessive. Sensible changes are made by Clause 2 in making the whole process stronger. It delivers what the Assembly and the Mayor want; it bolsters the Assembly's contribution. I do not think that the amendments add anything, and I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I did not mean informal or smaller consultations; I am sorry that I was not clear. When I said that there has not been a problem so far, that was in terms of the Assembly

That relates to subsection (2) of the amendment. Subsection (3) of the amendment is almost a coda to Amendment No. 2, which we debated, and is not intended to add to the bureaucratic burden, because the last thing that one would want is for a Mayor not to be throwing out ideas and listening to people. Any Mayor has to be clear about what is a formal consultation and not get people alarmed that he might take steps that he is not going to consult on properly. We had the debate mostly on the previous amendment. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000122"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is where we enter back into the principles rather than the personalities, and I say that very clearly because again this is an area of unfinished business from the previous Greater London Authority discussions and the previous Bill. The purpose of the amendment is to set a maximum of two terms of office for the Mayor of London. That is an established model, which is widely used for equivalent positions in other parts of the world&#151;for example, the mayor of New York, who is always cited as one of the examples for the Mayor of London. It is also used more generally by many other constitutions and is certainly something that we ought to consider mirroring here.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000123"></a>Our national situation elucidates some of the main arguments in favour of a two-term limit. I am sure that no one in this Committee would credibly argue that third-term Governments have particular success. Both parties would probably agree that you get tired towards the end. Two years on, the Government still regularly refer to the parochial achievement of having won three successive elections whenever they are on the defensive. That in itself presents an argument in favour of the amendment. Success should be measured in terms of actual government. It is a sad but undeniable fact that after two terms the incumbent often runs out of fresh ideas or motivation. The Administration can stall through a lack of direction or become complacent under a leader who is beginning not to have good ideas.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000124"></a>We are to some extent creating a cult of personality with the Mayor of London, whoever that might be. There is an extreme possibility that a Mayor could end up almost in the role of dictator by being elected time after time and with very little opposition from the Assembly to what he is doing. As we have heard, the Assembly has power of scrutiny; it does not have sufficient power to hold the Mayor to account on all occasions. We will also propose in an amendment in a

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000125"></a>Our only reason for preferring our amendment to Amendment No. 37, which was tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is that this is a matter of fundamental significance, which we feel should be reflected earlier in the Bill. A two-term limit will become an even more important safeguard after the Bill is enacted, given the increased powers that the Bill gives to the Mayor's office. Some form of restriction is necessary to temper the office and to ensure that it is accountable, and not only between elections. The Mayor should have a limited amount of time to do what he wants to do. We believe that that time is eight years. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0705019000126"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0705019000210"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I support Amendment No. 37 in the name of my noble friends Lady Hamwee and Lady Scott of Needham Market. My noble friend Lady Hamwee began by saying that we must constantly remind ourselves that we are talking about the office and not the office holder. That is certainly the case here, although it is rather difficult when there has only ever been one holder of that office and when all the experience that we have of it is based on that experience. Incidentally, I do not seek to argue with the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about where this should be in the Bill. Indeed, I believe that we are both seeking to achieve exactly the same objective and establish exactly the same principle. I can do no better than to quote the present incumbent of the office, in his previous incarnation as the honourable Member for Brent East, when he responded to the Government's original White Paper, which proposed the establishment of a strategic authority for London. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0705019000158"></a>&#147;The government should also reconsider its decision not to have term limits for the mayor. So much of the American experience of directly elected mayors shows it gets progressively more difficult to defeat a well-dug-in incumbent who has been able to establish extensive systems of patronage. As recent experience in Paris also shows&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0705019000133"></a>he was speaking in 1998&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0705019000164"></a>&#147;corruption tends to flourish the longer an incumbent is able to hold onto power.</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0705019000159"></a>In a city that changes as rapidly as London it is hard to believe that a mayor who has served two terms will have the freshness of approach that is required to stay abreast of such a dynamic city. I therefore recommend that no mayor should serve more than two terms&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000127"></a>Incidentally, he went on to say in the next sentence:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0705019000160"></a>&#147;If I am lucky enough to be elected as London's first mayor and bearing in mind I have already served 5 years as leader of the GLC, I would not seek to serve more than one term&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000128"></a>I recently read that he has an ambition still to be Mayor in 2016, so presumably he has changed his view on at least part of this submission.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000129"></a>The important point is that we are talking about a mayoral system&#151;a presidential system. Although it is not universal, it is certainly quite normal throughout the world&#151;it is certainly quite normal throughout Europe and the United States&#151;to have term limits.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0705019000130"></a>The normal limit is two terms, although those terms may be of differing lengths. That is particularly

If that power extends and is held for too long, as indeed Mr Livingstone said in 1998, the tendency to corrupt&#151;I do not mean financially&#151;and to become tired is that much greater.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000001"></a>Therefore, I strongly propose that we should have a term limit for the Mayor and, indeed, for any other executive office held by an individual, as is often the case. I should point out too that it is very much in accordance with the Nolan principles that there should be a term limit for such public appointments for exactly the same reasons. I hope that the Government will now do as the then honourable Member for Brent East suggested back in 1998 and give very serious consideration to a term limit&#151;we suggest two terms&#151;for the Mayor of London.</p>

However, I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I refer to it as the Greg Dyke amendment because we seem to have an attempted agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Parties, which are clearly faced with a situation in which they are not confident that they could defeat the current incumbent. While no doubt they would argue that this is not about the current office holder but rather the office, I suspect that the opposite is true.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000003"></a>Having said that, I wish to address the principle of the amendment. I am not sure that it is correct that mayors of New York are limited to two terms. I can think of a number who have served more than two terms but the arrangements may have changed since then so I am not sure whether that is accurate. However, I am conscious that there are no such precedents in this country as regards elected office. That is a very important point. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, referred to the Nolan principles with regard to public bodies. However, those principles apply to people holding responsibilities by virtue of appointment and patronage. That is the distinction. In this case, if there is patronage, it is the patronage of the electorate. I wonder about the arrogance of saying to the people of London that they cannot choose to re-elect somebody for a third term if that is what they wish to do.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000004"></a>The points made about people becoming stale and less responsive may or may not have been directed at the present incumbent. However, they imply that winning a third term is probably more difficult than winning a second and that winning a fourth term is certainly more difficult than winning a third. But the point is that the people of London should decide whether they want a Mayor to serve for three consecutive terms, or for a third term having served two terms earlier. I wonder whether the parties opposite are suggesting not so much that there should be term limits for the Mayor of London but that the same should apply to elected councillors, London Assembly members or Members of Parliament.

That seems to me an unfortunate combination of circumstances. On the other hand, applying this measure to the current Mayor would be entirely inappropriate, particularly as we are about a year ahead of the elections for the GLA. It is an interesting proposal. I am not worried about precedent because the previous GLA Act was all about setting new rules and stretching the envelope.

<p><a name="07050112000010"></a>As my noble friends said, there is ample precedent of the matter not applying in all other democratic bodies, especially those involved in national and local government. It has always been left to the party concerned. We have all had experience of colleagues being deeply distressed when they have been deselected. They are deselected by their party caucus or ward. They cannot understand it because they had done a good job. Painful as it may be, it is decided that they should step aside for somebody else who is anxious to become a councillor. Or it may be decided that their time is up. However, that decision is taken democratically by the people who are as close as possible to the action.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000011"></a>If this measure becomes law, the decision will be democratic but, frankly, we are meddling here with a fundamental point.

<p><a name="07050112000014"></a>My only interest in this is as someone who lives in London, at least occasionally during the week. It always strikes me that, contrary to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, it does not become harder for an incumbent to win. The weight of the machinery&#151;including that magnificent publication, the <I>Londoner</I>, a sort of Ken Livingstone propaganda machine that is doled out to us all&#151;influences and affects the democratic process adversely, because the power of incumbency is enormous. We have to be honest about what we have: a presidential system in London. If the Government have their way, we will have the same system throughout England, so we must take heed of the lessons we learn from what is happening in London, because soon we will have it everywhere else.</p>

It has been said often that, if we limited the term for the Mayor, we should do so for council leaders. In the United States, there are state governors&#151;you can only have one term as Governor of Virginia&#151;but local government is exactly the same as here. There is no limit to it. We go back to the point&#151;and I support what the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, has just said&#151;about vesting all this power in one person. That is what happens in the United States, and it is what is happening here with the Mayor. That is why we are talking about limiting terms as they are limited in the United States. It is nothing whatever to do with local government.</p>

New York, where they have a fixed term, is one example, but I read here that Chicago does not. We had better be careful about drawing these parallels.

<p><a name="07050112000020"></a>I take issue with the idea that somehow after two terms, let alone three, you run out of steam. I can only refute that; we have an example of a third-term Government who are boiling over with new ideas and energy.

<p><a name="07050112000021"></a>In this eloquent debate, the most important point has been exposed by many noble Lords. If we were to accept Amendments Nos. 4 and 37, that would have fundamental implications for the post of Mayor. It would set a precedent, and not only for the relationship between the electorate and everyone who is elected. It would raise a fundamental question about the best way of getting rid of people in office. Ultimately, it has to be for the London electorate to decide who should be Mayor; they must have a choice over whether to re-elect an incumbent. Yes, incumbents have an additional benefit, but they also have longer track records that can be held up to the light. When we see the charismatic Conservative candidate who eventually emerges, we look forward to

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000022"></a>We must be careful not to look to the Bill to do something so radical and create such an upheaval. Obviously, fundamental changes in the GLA constitution can be made only when there is a clear and overwhelming case and when there is a consensus. No one would want to move on the grounds of political expediency on such an important matter. The White Paper in 1998 made it clear that there should be no limit on the number of terms of office that either the Mayor or the Assembly Members could serve, and that is in common with other categories of elected office across the country. I found it slightly surprising that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, put this amendment forward; in Committee in the other place, the Front-Bench Conservative spokesman clearly expressed his opposition to term limits.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000023"></a>Nevertheless, this has been an interesting and, in some ways, entertaining debate, and I look forward to the noble Lords not proceeding with their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000024"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07050112000249"></a>Lord Tope:</b> I shall respond first to the noble Lord, Lord Harris and help with the situation in New York. In fact the mayor of New York is now limited to two terms, I accept; otherwise I suspect Mayor Giuliani might still be mayor&#151;but that is another issue. Incidentally, the city councillors in New York are also limited to two terms. There is much debate in New York about whether that term limit should be removed, and considerable public opposition to the removal of that limit.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000025"></a>The Conservative amendment is moved because of the present incumbent, but on our part that is not the case; our amendment has the same intention as the one we moved at the time of the original Bill. At that time Mr Livingstone agreed with us. We have always believed, and still do, that there should be a term limit for the Mayor of London. If the amendment were to be accepted, there might then be a question about when it was implemented&#151;I accept that to bring it in with less than a year to go before the election is capable of misinterpretation, as we have heard today&#151;but the principle remains the same.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000026"></a>The suggestion that we cannot change this because it was not in the original Act flies in the face of the precedent quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, about the American Constitution, which the Americans changed. President Roosevelt was the only president to hold office three times; Mayor Livingstone might well be the only Mayor of London to do so. With the Bill we have an opportunity to change the system.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000027"></a>Several noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, asked: what is the difference? As my noble friend said, the crucial difference is between a parliamentary system where power is shared&#151;although perhaps sometimes more in theory than in practice&#151;with a Cabinet Government, with a Parliament or with a local  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC27"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>authority with a number of councillors, and a presidential system that puts executive power in the hands of one person. That is why we are moving an amendment to this effect. It is outside the purpose of the Bill to apply to all elected mayors, but London was the first place in this country to have a directly elected Mayor with executive powers. Personally I would extend a term limit to all other elected mayors for exactly that reason.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000028"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07050112000250"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> With the ending of the committee system in local government and the creation of cabinet members, is it not true that cabinet members in many local authorities effectively have quasi-executive power within those local authorities, and their positions are very similar?</p>

<p><a name="07050112000029"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07050112000251"></a>Lord Tope:</b> In most cases they have shared executive power. Again, it is a shared executive of up to 10 members. It is not personal power. That may change when the local government Bill is enacted, but we can deal with that when we get to that Bill. The principle is the difference between a presidential and a parliamentary system, and most UK local government still has a parliamentary system. When and if that changes, this is one of the implications that we will have to deal with. London was the first place to have an elected Mayor, and we have a Bill that enables us to deal with this issue. Whether the Government and legislators choose to follow that precedent is a matter for elsewhere and for another time. This is an opportunity that I believe quite strongly that we should take. When I speak to colleagues, not particularly in America but on the Continent, they are surprised that we have a Mayor of London with no term limit at all. That does not mean that we have to follow what others do, but we have to learn and think carefully about the reasons why others do as they do. That is why we tabled the amendment. As I did not move the lead amendment, I cannot withdraw it. I will leave that to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000030"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07050112000252"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Tope, for saying almost exactly what I was going to say. It is an extremely difficult debate to have without being accused&#151;as we were by the noble Lord, Lord Harris&#151;of having other alternatives behind this. That is exactly what I expect from him, in his usual kindly way, as he smiles over his glasses, but it is not true.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000031"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Tope, said, there has been no opportunity to revisit this since the Greater London Authority Bill became an Act. In the light of thinking about it further&#151;I suppose in fact in thinking of the lack of control that there is in the system on the Mayor&#151;we believe there is nothing else in our local government where there is one person who is all-powerful. There is no one but the electorate, once every four years, who can stop the Mayor in this system or can do anything to stop the policies. The Assembly can scrutinise, as we have now put aside the amendment that the Assembly should have to approve strategies. There is not even that power. The Assembly has a scrutiny role. There is nothing

If you had a Mayor who had even more ambition than the current Mayor, no one could stop him. The Government could not stop him, and the Assembly could not stop him. There is no control at all on the Mayor. There should be a limitation on the amount of time for which he holds power; that should be the way that things develop.</p>

He has to behave sensibly. He is there at the mercy of the electorate. Surely, there is not any more powerful sanction than that.</p>

I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000036"></a>Clause 4 [<I>Confirmation hearings etc for certain appointments by the Mayor</I>]:</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000038"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are also in this group, and the noble Baroness has tabled Amendment No. 6 in this group. This group of amendments takes us to confirmation hearings, which are dealt with substantially in the schedule, although these amendments are to the main part of the Bill and deal with the offices to which the new arrangements will apply.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000039"></a>It has been said to me that a lot of people are waiting to see the Assembly playing silly buggers with this new power, and I said that I would repeat that, not only as a challenge to <I>Hansard</I> but to refute it before the accusation is made. The Assembly will put standing orders and protocols into place, as it has in connection with all its other responsibilities. The Assembly, of which I have had experience&#151;that personalises the debate&#151;is entirely capable of exercising common sense. It has plenty else to do with its time, and I do not see any Assembly wishing to spend all its time holding confirmation hearings. I was interested to see the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, turn to her officials. I do not know whether she is taking any advice on the term &#147;silly buggers&#148;. Perhaps she is. The bodies to which the Mayor makes appointments&#151;existing bodies, as well as the new ones, fall within this&#151;will be able to exercise considerable responsibility. Some of these bodies have enormous budgets, so this is a very serious matter.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000040"></a>At any rate, the Bill provides, before the Secretary of State makes a further order, that these officers are chairs and deputy chairs. I doubt that any Mayor would be so crass as to appoint as chair or deputy  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>chair an individual who is clearly within his own pocket. However, a Mayor might well appoint someone who has expertise in a subject but who is not terribly strong and is possibly a little nave and without the political nous that these positions require, and who would be unlikely to be able to resist a cabal among other board members. It could be quite difficult to point to why the appointment of a slightly nave chair was not desirable. I should make it clear that I am not referring to any current or past office holder. Questioning prospective board members more widely might well bring issues into the public arena, which is what these confirmation hearings are about. The Assembly will make recommendations, but that is as far as it goes. It is the potentially public nature of the event that will be all important.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000041"></a>Would the Assembly want to question all candidates? Frankly, as I have said, I do not see it: the Assembly has plenty of other work. If it did go ahead and question all candidates for all board positions, the hearings would very quickly lose the attention of the public and the media. As I have learnt in the past seven years, we are more dependent on the media than I wanted to think when I was first elected. I do believe, however, that the Assembly should have the right to question more widely.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000042"></a>The Government say that they want the process to &#147;bed down&#148;&#151;that is the term that is used. It would be much less controversial if, at this stage, the Government allowed for a range of appointments to come within this procedure, rather than make an order to extend the range after encountering difficulty. So far as I can see, the Government have not yet in Parliament given any reason, other than that of bedding down, why they are not willing to extend this to appointees who, they must accept, could outvote the chair.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000043"></a>I was interested to see that London First broadly supports the principle of confirmatory hearings extending to all board members. I do not know whether I am stealing the thunder of the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, if I quote from its briefing, but it says that that will be a useful tool for establishing in public the basis of an individual&#146;s appointment and whether they are appropriately qualified. London First expressed concern about the delay that there might be in establishing a new board at the time of a new mayoralty. That is a fair point.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000044"></a>However, in balancing the concerns, I come down very firmly on allowing the Assembly to judge the reasonable way to proceed. Amendment No. 5, as the other amendments do in slightly different ways, broadens the scope of this provision. I beg to move.</p>

We will have fuller debates on health strategy later and on the role of the health adviser and his or her deputies. That is part of consideration of the Bill. </p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000047"></a>The amendment would include the health adviser and the deputy health adviser on the list of individuals whose confirmation is required by the Assembly. As will become clear from our forthcoming debates, the position of health adviser could potentially have great influence over the health service in London. Sweeping changes that impact on all Londoners could be made under the health inequalities strategy. In those circumstances, we do not believe that the health adviser should have an automatic appointment from within the Civil Service&#151;and we propose another amendment to that effect later&#151;nor do we believe that the appointment should be without scrutiny approval. Therefore, we propose Amendment No. 6.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000048"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0004.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="07050112000258"></a>Baroness Valentine:</b> I should probably speak for London First myself, but I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. She has more or less summarised our views on this. I just want to say that in the interests of transparency it is entirely appropriate that confirmatory hearings should be for the full board. I am more worried about time being consumed, particularly with a new Mayor coming in, and whether it is really necessary to interview the entire board. What we seek is possibly some way of selecting, say, three people from the board, which could include the chair, to hold hearings, with something that makes this a slightly less onerous-sounding amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000049"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0004.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="07050112000259"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> Amendment No. 5 is perfectly sensible, but I am not sure that it is necessary. I have long felt that it is an important role to give the Assembly more and appropriate powers in respect of some of the activities of the Mayor and the functional bodies. This would be an area where it would be useful for the qualifications and experience of individuals appointed to certain offices to be exposed and perhaps challenged and questioned by members of the Assembly.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000050"></a>Therefore, I have no particular problems with Amendment No. 5; my only question is whether it is really necessary, given the power at Clause 4(1)(5) enabling the Secretary of State to extend the section by specifying further offices. It is really a question of whether that should be done by extending the list at this stage or whether the Secretary of State should be given that option at a later stage. Certainly, the principle of enabling the Assembly to question potential appointees is valuable.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000051"></a>I do not want to start another debate about the American experience. However, without ever getting to a point similar to where Congress votes on some presidential nominees, some nominees may decide that they are perhaps not as suited as they perhaps thought they were for the offices concerned and decide to withdraw. I suspect that we might see that process without ever getting to the stage where the Assembly had to take a view on some of the individuals concerned.</p>

The Government believe that the new confirmation hearings will provide an important and potentially very exciting new role for the Assembly. As my noble friend Lord Harris has just picked up, this is a key area where an extension of the role of the Assembly could work very well. They would enable the Assembly to undertake thorough and public scrutiny of the key appointments the Mayor is required to make&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, stressed the importance of the public nature of the confirmation hearings and the potential role of the media&#151;to establish the scrutiny and to scrutinise the suitability of a candidate for the appointment, and, most importantly, to challenge an appointment if necessary before the Mayor takes his final decision.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000053"></a>The list of offices to which confirmation hearings apply are set out at Clause 4. The process for undertaking the hearings, which I expect we will discuss further in a moment, are set out in Schedule 1. That creates a robust framework for the Assembly to really make a success of this new role. That is the key point for the Government. They believe that these provisions provide the right framework and balance of discretion and prescription to ensure the success of the confirmation hearings process.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000054"></a>The amendments tabled by noble Lords opposite, in contrast, cut directly across what we see as the key principle that underpins the new process&#151;that confirmation hearings apply to the key appointments the Mayor is required to make, and that this is the right place to start. The Government, therefore, wish to resist the amendments. I should like to explain in perhaps a little detail why that is so.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000055"></a>Amendments Nos. 5 to 8 would extend the list of offices to which confirmation hearings would apply. Amendment No. 5 extends the list to include any statutory appointment the Mayor makes. Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 would include the GLA&#146;s health adviser and deputy health adviser and the Mayor&#146;s appointments to the Board of Governors of the Museum of London respectively. Amendment No. 8 seeks to include mayoral appointments to the London regional council of Arts Council England, the English Sports Council, London regional sports boards and Archives, Libraries and Museums London. For technical reasons, Amendment No. 8 does not achieve that, but we understand where that amendment is coming from.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000056"></a>The amendments would extend the number of offices to which confirmation hearings can apply to well over 100 in total. I fully appreciate the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that this would not necessarily mean the Assembly undertaking over 100 confirmation hearings and that it would be able to pick and choose which prospective appointments would benefit most from a confirmation hearing being held. We cannot agree that that would be a better approach than what is outlined in the Bill.</p>

<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lady Hamwee, about media interest, it would be a disappointment if these confirmation hearings were not to attract considerable interest and attention and therefore to focus on the greatest influence over delivery and the appointment of chairs and deputy chairs of the functional bodies; that is, to the boards of Transport for London, the London Development Agency, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and the Metropolitan Police Authority. Extending the scope of the Assembly&#146;s role to any mayoral appointment risks spreading the net too widely before the Assembly has been able to make a real success of this new role.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000058"></a>The question was asked whether it is more than encouraging the Assembly to allow this to bed down. There are some complicating factors in enabling confirmation hearings to apply to all mayoral appointments. For some organisations, such as the Metropolitan Police Authority and the Museum of London, the Mayor appoints only a proportion of board members. These amendments would apply the confirmation hearing process to some of the board members but not to others. Other mayoral appointments are subject to the approval of the Secretary of State; for example, members of the new London Skills and Employment Board. We do not believe that confirmation hearings would be appropriate given that line of accountability.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000059"></a>Confirmation hearings should apply to the most important appointments the Mayor is required to make. These appointments are set out in the Bill. This is a new and potentially very important and exciting role for the Assembly. We would like to see the process bed down and for the Assembly to make a success of its new role before considering the case for increasing the number of mayoral appointments, to which confirmation hearings apply.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000060"></a>As my noble friend Lord Harris pointed out, Clause 4 includes provision for the Secretary of State by order to specify further offices which may be subject to confirmation hearings. That provides sufficient flexibility to amend the list of offices in the future, should that be required. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will feel able to withdraw the amendments.</p>

The noble Baroness actually made the point for me. We very much feel that the status of a health appointment should be raised because of relationships. I know from my own local government side, with the local government Bills coming up and the relationships between local government and health, how they might co-operate to save money and make the health service better. It is the same in London. Therefore, the status of the health appointments should be raised, so the noble Baroness has made my point for me. She has said that they are important posts. These are very important posts, and that is why they should be included in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000078"></a>I have one question, which I hope will not be regarded as entirely frivolous. In new Section 68(3) we have &#147;chairman&#148;, &#147;chairman&#148; and &#147;chairman&#148; until we come to the cultural strategy group, where the Bill refers to a chair. I am not one of those who takes all references to a chair of a meeting as an example of furniturism, although I have heard that said, but I am inquisitive why that particular post is referred to as the chair when all the rest refer to the chairman. I have always taken the view that it is open to the holder of the office to decide how he or she wishes to be referred to. Was it thought at one stage that this particular cultural strategy group would always have a lady chairman? If so, that seems jolly unfair on the men because there are some very good cultural men about. I do not count myself as one of them, but I would be interested to know why this particular one is referred to as a &#147;chair&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000091"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to remove the Mayor&#146;s power to appoint himself without Assembly oversight. Under the Bill, most proposed appointments by the Mayor must pass through confirmation hearings held by the Assembly, as we have just talked about, but extraordinarily, as the Bill stands, there is no such requirement when the Mayor wishes to appoint himself to a position. The amendment seeks nothing more nefarious than to subject the Mayor to the same process as all other appointees. It has already become a familiar refrain, both at Second Reading and in our opening exchanges this afternoon, that the Mayor  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>faces precious little scrutiny by the Assembly. That position is only exacerbated by the Bill. This is another striking illustration of the complete lack of accountability for the Mayor&#146;s actions. We debated that earlier. Leaving aside for now the complaint that the confirmation hearings themselves do not give the Assembly much real influence, it is remarkable that the Government are proposing to allow the Mayor not only to take up a new post without any form of approval but to make this very similar appointment himself without any formal safeguard. I beg to move.</p>

Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 prevents the Assembly holding confirmation hearings for offices to which the Mayor appoints himself. I disagree with the noble Lord; the Assembly already has ample time to question the Mayor, for example, at the 10 Assembly meetings held each year that he is required to attend. It is unnecessary to add to the frequent meetings between the Mayor and the Assembly. There is also the risk of a confirmation hearing involving the Mayor becoming overtly political and about the person rather than the office, with all sides adopting entrenched party political positions. The purpose of the hearings is to establish the calibre of the candidate and their suitability for the office in question. With regard to the debate that we have just had, naivety is very much something that the confirmation hearings would identify. The purpose of the hearings could be lost in the welter of predictable political exchanges. Therefore, we resist Amendments Nos. 9 and 10.</p>

However, say he wanted to appoint himself to something that the Assembly felt needed a different approach because of the dual nature. Surely there should be some ability for the Assembly to question that, whereas there is no ability for the Assembly to question the appointment of the Mayor in any position, as it stands, even if the Mayor goes to all the meetings.</p>

Although the noble Lord envisages a confirmation hearing, perhaps that power could be used to have the kind of exchange that he is thinking about. Maybe that would satisfy his perceived need for the amendments. I see no reason why the Assembly cannot use that power.</p>

Paragraph 3 of the schedule lists the limited amount of information required: the candidate&#146;s name, address, the office and the reasons for the proposed appointment. The last requirement in the list sounds fine, but it could be quite glib. The Mayor could give very little information about the basis for the appointment. He could say that the candidate was a jolly good chap who had done well in the past. In order to make the confirmation hearing a sensible process, the Assembly needs information on which to base its questions. The application therefore seems a convenient way of providing it. It should give all the necessary background information and would be an easy thing to provide; it would not add to the bureaucratic burden, about which we talk so much and keep saying we shall try to avoid.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000103"></a>Perhaps I may explain the amendment by way of setting out a comparable situation which arose last autumn. In September, the Mayor&#146;s office consulted the Assembly chair about a proposed appointment to the board of the London Development Agency. There is currently a limited requirement for some consultation on such an appointment. The Mayor&#146;s office required a response within 12 days. No meeting had been arranged during the period in which the appointment could be considered. As the then deputy chair and the chair of a relevant committee, I wrote to the Mayor&#146;s office seeking information about the individual. I also googled that individual and got quite a bit of information from the website, but frankly that is not the way one should find out about these things: it was more about experience rather than

<p><a name="07050112000106"></a>It might be said that all that information would come out during a confirmation hearing, but it would be much more sensible and efficient to have to hand the basic information before the hearing begins in order to allow questions to be designed to meet the circumstances and to enable the candidate to give of his or her best instead of the rather scatter-gun approach that must be taken if one starts without adequate information. I seek the Government&#146;s understanding that in proposing to add this requirement, there is nothing sinister or bureaucratic about it. It would be a straightforward way of assisting the Assembly to do a good job. I beg to move.</p>

It is of course vital that the Assembly has sufficient information about the office in question and the candidate whom the Mayor proposes to appoint in order fully to scrutinise the role, but we do not agree that requiring the Mayor to provide the Assembly with a copy of the candidate&#146;s application is the best way to achieve that objective. An application form may include personal information that the candidate may not want to be disclosed - especially given what we hope will be the extremely public nature of these confirmation hearings. Paragraph 6(4) enables the Assembly to request that the candidate produces any document in his or her possession. It should be for the candidate to decide whether to provide the Assembly with their application, if the Assembly requests  it.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000110"></a>Given that they want to be appointed to the post in question, I would expect any candidate to be keen to comply as far as possible with any request made by the Assembly for information. Equally, the Assembly should be able to draw its own conclusions, should the candidate refuse such a request for information. I do not want to comment on the individual example given, but I remind the Committee that we are talking about a public hearing. From my point of view, this is a key representational test for any candidate. The information that they choose to share and the information that the Assembly chooses to request will form part of the assessment that the Assembly will want to make of the candidate. Withholding  that information will no doubt be taken into  account.</p>

I presume that, under the provision, the Mayor goes through some kind of selection process for which he must presumably have an application form or a CV. Hopefully, a number of candidates will apply. If the candidates know that if they are successful, that application form will be given to the Assembly, as it ought to be, surely that would be sufficient. In due time, if the candidate was successful, some of that information should be available to the Assembly. To ask an adjudicating body not to have that information before it starts and to rely on having to ask the candidate for it seems to me to be making the way to appoint people by ways as bizarre as the medical route.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000128"></a>The Bill provides that the Assembly can hold confirmation hearings into proposed mayoral appointments. In doing so, it gives the Assembly no real power to confirm or reject an appointment. Instead, all that the Assembly can do following a confirmation hearing is make a recommendation that the Mayor may either accept or reject. They are confirmation hearings in name only. The amendments will create the entirely logical position that the Mayor would require the approval of the Assembly for appointments by giving the Assembly the power to reject proposed appointments. The amendments do not unreasonably shift power away from the Mayor, who would still propose appointments and still be able to proceed with an appointment if the Assembly did not make a decision. This would create a satisfactory and balanced process where appointments could be approved without a hearing but could only be rejected following a request to attend a hearing. If the Bill does not give the Assembly proper scrutiny of the Mayor&#146;s

This seems to me to go to the heart of what I suspect will be a series of debates that we will have during the course of the Committee and in due course in later stages of the Bill about the balance of power between the Assembly and the Mayor. Essentially, as I understand the amendments in this group, and Amendment No. 13, which is not grouped, they would give the Assembly a power by a majority vote not to approve a particular nominee. That may or may not be an admirable solution, but it is one that changes the nature of the mayoralty system.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000131"></a>The whole structure of the Greater London Authority Act has been devised as a &#147;strong mayor model&#148;&#151;to use the academic jargon&#151;of a fairly weak Assembly but with some powers. The amendments tabled at various stages shift from a two-thirds majority to a simple majority the powers of the Assembly, while this one introduces a new power for the Assembly with a simple majority. I suspect that they will raise some really big issues about how we see the relationship between the Mayor and the Assembly.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000132"></a>One could devise a perfectly acceptable mayoral model with a different balance between the Mayor and the Assembly. What you cannot do, without a radical look at every single aspect of the Greater London Authority Act, is change some aspects of it by giving the Assembly greater powers to act with a simple majority, as opposed to the enhanced majority which already exists for the budget.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000133"></a>I am sympathetic to the idea of having confirmation hearings with the possibility of the Assembly doing more than simply saying, &#147;We do not recommend this appointment&#148;, or, &#147;We do recommend this appointment&#148;. However, if it is to be consistent with the rest of the Greater London Authority Act, with a strong mayoral model, it should be on the basis of a qualified majority of perhaps two-thirds voting not to approve a particular nomination. If you go down the route of saying that there can be a vote by a simple majority, you are essentially undermining the power of the Mayor and his ability to act in the way envisaged in the rest of the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000134"></a>For those who say that confirmation hearings would have no relevance unless there is a power to reject, I would argue that the significance of the Assembly, even by a simple majority, recommending to the Mayor that an appointment should not proceed, will be very damaging to the authority of nominees. It is not something that I hope the Assembly would do lightly, but it is something where the nominee would want to consider very carefully his position. He may feel that the Assembly was acting on a party political spasm whereby two parties combine to create a majority, or whatever the numbers would require, and therefore that it was not relevant. However, it is clearly something that they would consider.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000135"></a>The power as currently envisaged in the Bill, whereby confirmation hearings would take place and the Assembly would either support the nomination or recommend to the Mayor that it should not be proceeded with, but the Mayor would still have the power to continue, puts a significant constraint on the power. It is a significant constraint on the individuals because they would be made to think again if the Assembly said, &#147;You are not acceptable to us&#148;, but it does not alter the fundamental constitutional relationship between the Mayor and the Assembly. If we agree these amendments, we will alter the fundamental constitutional arrangement, and that would require a rethink of the whole GLA Act.</p>

I do not support these amendments or, indeed, Amendment No. 13. I agree that the amendment changes the principle of the strong mayor model. It does, however, argue very strongly for some of the argument we have just had on previous amendments, which is that the process of confirmatory hearings needs to be thoroughly professional and transparent. I would like to put some emphasis on our earlier conversations.</p>

It is no secret that Amendments  Nos. 12, 15, 16 and 19, which have the effect of requiring the consent of the Assembly before the Mayor is able to make an appointment, would overturn the present balance of power.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000138"></a>As my noble friend said, this is the beginning of a debate that we will have in relation to the budget, for example, and other aspects where we are considering what it means to have a strong mayoral model. While confirmation hearings are a very important addition to the Assembly&#146;s scrutiny role, and certainly important in assessing the calibre and suitability of candidates, it is absolutely right that the Mayor, as the executive of the GLA, should retain the final say on the appointment. It is a confirmation hearing. Therefore, the Assembly needs to think about how to focus on what it is there to do, which is to scrutinise. We would not want to see any open conflict between the Mayor and the Assembly over who should be appointed by putting the nature of these appointments into the political arena.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000139"></a>Amendment No. 17 would enable the Assembly to proceed with a confirmation hearing where the candidate does not attend. We cannot accept this amendment, as it is wholly unnecessary. The Bill defines a confirmation hearing as a meeting at which the candidate is requested to appear to answer Assembly Members&#146; questions, but the Assembly is not required to hold a confirmation hearing before making a recommendation to the Mayor. It is of course free to meet without the candidate to discuss his or her nomination. Such a meeting would be an ordinary meeting or an ordinary committee of the Assembly; we see no reason to call it a confirmation hearing. We have before us a large issue and a smaller, more technical, issue. I am afraid that I have to resist both amendments.</p>

It can do all sorts of things: it can scrutinise till its head drops off but it will not be able to do anything about what it scrutinises. If the Assembly cannot make a decision on a confirmation hearing other than to say, &#147;That was very nice, thank you very much, now go away&#148;, there seems no point in having confirmation hearings at all.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000141"></a>The Assembly has to come to a conclusion about what these hearings are about and what and who they have been listening to.

<p><a name="07050112000147"></a>Under the Bill as drafted, the Mayor notifies the Assembly of a prospective appointment or appointee and the Assembly has to decide whether to hold a hearing. That will require the Assembly to meet, which requires notice of a meeting. Under the Local Government Act, which applies to Assembly meetings, five clear days&#146; notice has to be given. I have referred to the Assembly, but it could be the full Assembly or a committee of the Assembly. In either case&#151;and I say this from experience, some of which has been quite bitter over the past seven years&#151;  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ensuring that there will be a quorum available for a full Assembly meeting or for a committee if it is called at short notice is not as straightforward as those who do not know about these things might think.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000148"></a>We are already about a week into the three-week period. Then the Assembly decides to hold the hearing, for which it has to notify the candidate. To do that, it informs the head of paid service, who has to send a registered or recorded delivery letter giving at least a week&#146;s notice. We are now probably beyond the second week of the three-week period.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000149"></a>Heaven forbid that the Assembly might want to seek some further information or a period to reflect on it. But what we have at the moment is a three-week period with all these constraints; everything which has to be done before the Assembly makes its recommendation to the Mayor. I absolutely accept that it would not be desirable to prolong this process any more than is absolutely necessary. That would not be fair to the candidate and it would simply not be good practice.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000150"></a>The amendments are designed to retain what I suspect the Government think is most important in all this. Amendment No. 21 seeks to shorten the first leg of this by allowing a single member to decide whether to hold a hearing. That might sound rather dramatic, but the Assembly&#146;s practice has developed in a way which almost invariably seems to satisfy everybody, with conventions in place whereby decisions are frequently delegated to the Chair in consultation with the Deputy Chair and the leaders of all the political groups on the Assembly. That works well. If it did not work well in a particular instance, the Chair would be open to being questioned in public. I believe that the Standing Orders and the Act provide for this. At the extreme end, there could be a motion of no confidence in the Chair. Therefore, Amendment No. 21 seeks to change the restriction regarding what can be delegated to a single Member.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000151"></a>Amendment No. 18 would shorten the period of notice to a candidate. Again, we have practical experience in this regard because on a number of occasions the Assembly has, under the terms of the Act, summoned people to appear before it. The practice that has been developed is to seek a convenient date and as soon as possible to start discussions with the person you are summoning or requesting to appear. Again, there is plenty of experience of this. Therefore, reducing the period from one week to three days is not proposed with the expectation that something would be banged off in the post and the candidate would have to turn up in very short order without any practical notice.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000152"></a>Amendment No. 14 deals with a different situation. After a mayoral election, there is likely to be a raft of new amendments. Protocols will be put in place in the authority on how this will be dealt with, but a new mayor flexing his muscles might not be enthusiastic about prolonging a process. However, he might be very enthusiastic about making new appointments. To allow the Assembly to deal with new appointments in an ordered fashion and not try to get a whole lot done in such short order that the hearings are not held in a proper manner, I propose to

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000153"></a>Amendment No. 20 builds on something that the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, said. It concerns the answers that a candidate should give in response to questions. She expressed an expectation that a candidate would answer questions and that, if that were not the case, the Assembly could draw its own conclusions. The schedule does not require a candidate to answer questions. The additional words that I propose in Amendment No. 20 come straight from the existing Act and are used in connection with the questioning of certain office holders which the Assembly is currently entitled to undertake. It would require oral answers to be given at the hearing so far as that was reasonably practicable, and if that was not reasonably practicable it would require a written answer to be provided within a time limit.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000154"></a>I hope that the Minister will understand what lies behind all this. We in no way intend to subvert or alter the character of the Government&#146;s proposal; we wish to assist the process to be more effective and to achieve the very interesting arrangements that the Government are proposing. I beg to move.</p>

One cannot but have some sympathy with Amendment No. 14 in particular, because it seeks to extend the length of time in which the Assembly can make a recommendation to the Mayor from three weeks to six weeks following an election. It is understandable that the Assembly might wish to take longer to consider recommendations following a GLA election. We all know the upheaval that elections bring about. The trouble is that we must ensure&#151;this is equally important&#151;that confirmation hearings do not add undue delay. The noble Baroness said herself that it was not desirable to prolong processes. The point, however, is that these processes are about appointing candidates to senior posts, and there is a clear risk, should a vacancy arise during an election period, that a Mayor would reasonably wish to delay making an appointment until after the election; so there is already some delay built in. Extending the period in which the Assembly may make an appointment would add further delay.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000156"></a>We have been looking at the prospect of an extended vacancy right at the heart of the key service delivery organisations, such as TfL or the LDA. The noble Baroness took us through some of these processes, and it is interesting to hear how the Assembly works, but we see no strong reason why, immediately following an election, the Assembly could not convene a committee to undertake a confirmation hearing and make a recommendation. There may be better ways of doing this than the way proposed by the noble Baroness, which would lead to undue delay. We therefore cannot accept Amendment No. 14.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000157"></a>Amendment No. 18 would reduce the notice period given to the candidate before a confirmation hearing from one week to three working days. That strikes us as unreasonable in relation to general practice. It is a very short notice period. One week is a reasonable notice period, as it enables a candidate to prepare for a hearing. Three days is not long enough for a serious experience that can be rather formidable.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000158"></a>Amendment No. 20 would place a duty on the candidate to answer the Assembly&#146;s questions at a confirmation hearing or, if this is impractical, to provide a written answer within three working days of the hearing. We consider this amendment to be unnecessary, because, irrespective of what the previous Act provides, the Assembly can surely draw its own conclusions in the event of a candidate refusing to answer certain questions or their inability to provide sufficiently robust answers. I would have thought that that was pretty central to any appointments procedure. We do not want to place unnecessary burdens on candidates, only to deter them. Therefore, we cannot accept Amendment  No. 20.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000159"></a>I am, however, more sympathetic to Amendments Nos. 21 and 22, which would enable a single Member of the Assembly to decide whether a confirmation hearing should take place. The Bill currently provides for only the Assembly or an ordinary committee of the Assembly to undertake functions in relation to confirmation hearings. There is a good argument in favour of ensuring that a group of Assembly Members decide whether to hold a confirmation hearing, only because it could have such great media interest. It may be appropriate in such circumstances for a group of Assembly Members, rather than a single Member, to decide whether a confirmation hearing should take place. We accept the argument that, in certain circumstances, the Assembly may be best placed to delegate that decision to a single Assembly Member. We therefore welcome the opportunity to take away Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 and think about them further.</p>

I am happy either to meet the Minister myself or for officers from the GLA to meet with her officials in order to discuss the fine-tuning. One cannot expect anyone from outside an organisation to understand the detailed requirements that we either have been lumbered with or, indeed, have lumbered ourselves with. The Minister began by talking about &#147;undue delay&#148;; I emphasise the word &#147;undue&#148;. My amendments are neither intended to have nor would have the consequence of creating undue delay. I say that because the word &#147;delay&#148; has the connotation of being undesirable whereas what it really means is that taking longer would be the desirable thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000161"></a>After a mayoral and Assembly election&#151;there might be a by-election, but let us assume the normal term of four years&#151;I am not sure how an Assembly would deal with a mayoral proposal that arrived on the desk at lunchtime the next day. Given that the election of the Mayor was declared at around one

The Assembly is not required to hold its annual meeting, when appointments are made, for  10 days after the election, so there is already a problem built in. That is my instinctive concern about the comments of the noble Baroness. However, I do not want to prolong our discussion in Committee because there may be room for us to come closer together in the detail of what the Minister has indicated. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000168"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 24 and to the whole of Clause 7. This clause concerns the appointment of staff to the Greater London Authority; that is, those staff who, apart from the 12 direct appointments the Mayor can make, implement the Mayor&#146;s policies and put together strategies, as well as the Assembly staff. When the original Act was designed, two checks and balances were written into it. One was that staffing arrangements would be a matter for the Assembly. Staffing issues cover not only the terms and conditions for individual members of staff, but also the size of the establishment; that is, the number of posts in the authority. Putting on my current hat once more, given that we are governed by local government access to information provisions that allow access to meetings, the current practice is for the Assembly to hold committee meetings with agendas published in advance in the usual way, and for the views of staff, both as a result of direct individual staff consultation and as expressed through the union, to be reported. The committee meets in public and its meetings are webcast and minuted. I say all that because transparency is important in all this. The Assembly very much follows a local authority model where there is openness about how these things are arrived at.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000169"></a>No one has convinced me, or has even found an example that convinced me, of what is wrong with the current position. I have seen no example during the consultation on changes to the Act, or in discussion about it, nor from what I can see from reading <I>Hansard</I> for the debate in the Commons. The Minister in the Commons talked about anticipating potential tensions between the Mayor and the Assembly. He talked about this being potentially subject to the, &#147;disagreements, rows, trade-offs and arguments that inevitably take place between them&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Greater London Authority Bill Committee, 9/1/07; col. 36.] I am not sure that any of that is necessarily a bad thing in itself, but that is not really the point. After seven years, we are told that a  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC49"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>change should take place to avoid a &#147;potential&#148; problem. I would not characterise this clause as being, &#147;not a major change, and it will not cause problems or substantial difficulties in any quarter. It is a relatively sensible, not hugely interesting change that will improve support for the GLA staff&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Greater London Authority Bill Committee, 9/1/07; col. 39.]</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000170"></a>It has been put to me that terms and conditions of employment are really a matter for the officer head of an organisation, not for Members in this case or the board, if we were talking about a private company. Certainly, the Assembly has almost invariably followed the recommendations of officers as regards terms and conditions. This is completely off the top of my head, I did not bother to go back and look through our agendas, but examples that occur to me of matters that were discussed in public are, for example, when there was a change in the salary structure. That was not an easy process. Of course, a lot of work was undertaken before it came to committee, but it was right that staff heard that debate as well as being able to take part in an internal consultation.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000171"></a>Very recently, there was a discussion about maternity policy and the amount of statutory maternity pay paid to women opting for different periods of leave. Our debate brought out an aspect that required further officer work and clarification. We regularly consider publicly the numbers of staff employed from different minorities and the number of women employed, including at different grades, to see whether we are doing enough to assist different groups of staff to progress up the organisation. For instance, we have discussed the mechanisms to attract more candidates from certain communities, and I do not just mean &#147;the BME community&#148; as if it were one community, but all the communities within that.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000172"></a>There have been tensions, and one would expect that, because of the number of staff employed and because what they do is a politically contentious matter. It seems to be the view that only the 12 mayoral appointments are sensitive appointments, and as regards who is appointed that may be so, but the number of points is an issue. Everything that the GLA does is politically an issue. I have never heard of a row over the number of security staff, but there could be one on political grounds, because the number of security staff engaged directly reflects the activity that the politicians carry out within the building, such as the number of events sponsored by the Mayor.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000173"></a>For the first time last month the Assembly rejected or deferred a handful of proposed posts, but out of full-time equivalents totalling forty-two and a half the rejections were seven, and the deferrals, which were related to matters arising from the Bill&#151;deferred until we see whether planning powers in particular are agreed, because there is no certainty that they will have an easy ride&#151;were five; so there were seven and 5.5 out of 42.5. I can characterise the posts that were rejected as relating to mayoral promotion. The building was designed for 426 staff and is now carrying an establishment, not all of whom require desks, of about 770.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000174"></a>My view is that this is not at all a straightforward matter for the head of paid service. Once the Mayor  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has got his budget, what is the head of paid service to do when presented with proposals for extra posts except, in a fairly gentle manner, to query whether the building can accommodate them and so on? The head of paid service cannot be as robust as is needed in that situation.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000175"></a>That is mainly about the clause itself, but my Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are specific safeguards which, if the clause remains, the Assembly considers should be applied. That is the unanimous view of the Assembly across all the political groups, and they speak for themselves. I believe that in practice a requirement for consultation would be carried out, but it would be appropriate for it to be in the Bill. There are then some procedural matters about notice to enable the Assembly to carry out its scrutiny role, a role that is different from this one.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000176"></a>I appreciate that I have spoken in fairly robust terms, which is quite uncharacteristic of the way that staffing matters have been dealt with in what I will describe, having heard the term used of another Foster building, as &#147;up the Fosterista&#148;. I beg to move. </p>

I endorse what the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said: so far the Government have failed to offer any satisfactory justification for weakening the Assembly&#146;s scrutiny powers. The existing position, as she said, seems to be working very well and without complaint. In another place the Minister was unable to offer a single example of the current powers being abused in any way. There is not a single incident mentioned when the process has had unwelcome consequences, and the Government could not reveal any representation made by any professional body that this was an area of the law that needed review. Perhaps, now that three and a half months have elapsed since that debate first took place, the Minister will be able to give us some examples today.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000178"></a>The current position gave the Assembly a vital role in staff appointments. It was able to determine the overall complement, and to take an active role in various key appointments. Obviously it was not involved in all appointments, as has been suggested in the past, but the changes proposed in the Bill do not do the Assembly any favours at all, and it is fatuous to argue that they do.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000179"></a>The real benefit of the existing position was that the staffing discussions took place, as the noble Baroness has said, transparently, on a cross-party basis and not hidden from the public gaze. Full reports made to the Assembly are in the public domain. It seems that now the Mayor will be able to make these same decisions in private without scrutiny. This is a retrograde step, and we therefore support the amendments put forward by the noble Baroness.</p>

Section 67 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 provides for the appointment of three categories of employees of the authority and allows them to be appointed to the authority in different ways. First, as noble Lords know, the Mayor can appoint two political advisers. Those are personal appointments made by him alone; they do not need to be advertised or subject to competition and they can extend beyond the term of office for which a Mayor is elected. Secondly, he is able to appoint not more than 10 other members of staff; those posts are open to competition, and appointments are made on merit. Thirdly, the Assembly now appoints all other staff for the authority after consultation with the Mayor, and those appointments are made in similar terms to the appointment of local authority offices under local government legislation.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000181"></a>I reassure noble Lords that we are not making these changes with the Bill out of perversity, nor to somehow diminish or cripple the powers of the GLA. We are doing this for rational reasons, of which I hope I can persuade the Committee.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000182"></a>Clause 7 amends Section 67 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 to provide for those staff who are currently appointed by the Assembly to be appointed in future by the authority&#146;s head of paid service. He is the most senior GLA official. He must consult the Mayor and the Assembly before making appointments. He must have regard to available resources and the priorities of the authority in making them. The clause also amends Section 70 of the 1999 Act to allow the head of paid service to set the terms and conditions of the staff he appoints, again after consultation with the Mayor and Assembly. The appointments and terms and conditions of the existing staff have effect as if they had been appointed or set by the head of paid service. </p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000183"></a>Clauses 8 to 10 amend the 1999 Act to enable the Mayor and the Assembly, acting jointly, to appoint the authority&#146;s three statutory posts&#151;the head of paid service, the monitoring office and the chief finance officer&#151;and to set their terms and conditions. Holders of those posts cannot also be members of the authority staff. Clauses 8 to 10 also provide that any appointment or terms and conditions of existing holders of these posts have effect as if they were made under the provisions, as amended by Clause 8. That clause also allows the head of paid service to delegate any of his staffing functions to a member or staff of the authority other than to staff appointed by the Mayor.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000184"></a>The arguments that noble Lords have put forward are three: that &#147;The system isn&#146;t broke, it works well, don&#146;t try to fix it, it doesn&#146;t need it&#148;; that the Assembly has important levers in controlling the number and grading of staff and expenditure on staff by having this power; and, implicitly, that it keeps the Mayor under control. We are not making these changes because we think the Assembly has failed to carry out its functions effectively. They are no more than a timely, straightforward and sensible change. The organisation, which has been there since 1999, is maturing and developing, and it needs a clearer set of administrative arrangements that are fit for purpose  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and appropriate for its tasks. This is a sign of the Assembly growing up. It provides a clear separation between the administrative function of appointing staff and the Assembly&#146;s core functions of scrutiny. It is those core functions that we are seeking to build up with the Bill.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000185"></a>My experience, not least in the voluntary sector, is that organisations grow, and that as they mature, they must change. They must take on different functions, and they separate functions so that they become more appropriate. Clarifying and separating the functions in this way is a sign of credit to the organisation, in focusing on what it is there to do and can do best. The change gives the Assembly an opportunity to move forward; it gives it extra space, and I hope it gives it extra energy, in the sense of focus.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000186"></a>I hear what noble Lords said about the exchanges in the other place, but there is a serious argument here about taking these appointments out of the political arena. They inevitably become part of the political discourse. This change makes for a more objective and more appropriate system, and I am surprised it is not more welcome.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000187"></a>There are two anomalies in the present system; one is internal, the other comparative. The changes get rid of the first by focusing the staff appointments role at the official level. That takes away the anomaly of most GLA staff working to support the Mayor, yet relying on the Assembly for terms and conditions. It brings the GLA into line with other organisations in terms of good organisational practice, particularly local authorities; it is as simple as that. We would not expect the trustees of a voluntary body&#151;and I think that is a proper analogy&#151;to make staff appointments. We would not expect local councillors to appoint the staff of a local authority. We would expect authorities&#146; overview and scrutiny committees to maintain oversight, just as the Assembly does. I was searching for a comparison, and I think this is correct: we would not expect a Select Committee of this House or the other place to appoint parliamentary staff.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000188"></a>The argument that &#147;it ain&#146;t broke&#148; is right, and we are not proposing this change because we think it is; on the contrary, the current system has provided a steady hand on the staffing tiller, but it has also presided, as the noble Baroness said, over a significant growth in staff numbers as the authority has settled into its role. It is possible that there will be less scope for similar rates of growth in the future, and there is therefore an argument that we should move this out of the political arena to a more orthodox way of appointing GLA staff.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000189"></a>The noble Baroness put forward a robust argument that the Assembly&#146;s control of the staffing is a vital way of keeping control, as it were, of the organisation and even of the Mayor&#146;s ambitions. But the Assembly retains that power; what else is that power other than its ability to continue to debate, scrutinise and influence the GLA budget and the corporate plan? Those are the key mechanisms for determining the GLA&#146;s overall staffing position. It ensures a more strategic role for the Assembly.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000190"></a>The head of paid service will have to consult the Assembly and of course the Mayor, and, in relation to the Assembly&#146;s own staff, there will be for the first time a discrete Assembly budget. I hope the head of paid service, when he reads our proceedings in Committee, is not too disappointed by the expectation that somehow he will not be able to stand up to the Mayor. There were great compliments paid in the other place to the existing office-holder about his overall competence and ability. I have no doubt that he will be able to do the job extremely effectively, and I hope he will not be too dismayed by what the noble Baroness has said. These changes help to put the staffing role on a more strategic footing. I am not being disingenuous here&#151;I genuinely think they help the Assembly to concentrate on its strategic role.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000191"></a>I turn to the amendments, which I am afraid I have to resist. I was a bit unclear at first what noble Lords opposite intended with Amendment No. 23. I am clearer now, and I am grateful to the noble Baronesses for that. The amendment enables the head of paid service to determine any matter affecting the establishment of the authority following consultation with the Mayor and the Assembly. In fact, the Bill already gives the head of paid service this power in similar terms. New Section 67(2) allows him to appoint such staff as he considers necessary for the GLA to do its job. I assure noble Lords that we expect the head of paid service, in exercising his new power of appointment, to be responsible for all matters relating to the GLA establishment, including the total numbers of posts and the terms and conditions and grading of post holders, but he will have to consult the Mayor and the Assembly before deciding the overall staffing provision, set out in the authority&#146;s corporate plan, and so on. Amendment No. 23 is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000192"></a>Amendment No. 24 requires the head of paid service to give the Assembly a minimum of 28 days&#146; written notice before each decision he makes about the number of grades, numbers or function of posts or terms of employment. The Mayor and the Assembly can offer comments within that 28-day period, and on making a determination the head of paid service must make a written statement explaining why he has not accepted any of those comments. These are wholly impractical arrangements.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000193"></a>The noble Baroness has already explained some of the ways in which the processes of the GLA are somewhat protracted, but this would introduce even more delays and bureaucracy into the system. The amendments would lengthen the period for appointing the authority&#146;s staff, and, crucially, would put the GLA at a real disadvantage when it came to recruiting new talent. The London job market is hugely competitive. If we introduced a delay of  28 days, I dread to think of the number of good people who would have drifted away or found other jobs&#151;because people apply for more than one job at a time, as we know. Organisations need to act quickly, and adding a month to the process of identifying and filling posts would not help the head of paid service to recruit the staff he needs. He already has to consult the Mayor and the Assembly. I would expect him to

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000194"></a>I know that is a disappointing response for the noble Baroness, but it is a sincere one, and I hope that on that basis she will feel able to withdraw her amendments.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000195"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07050112000315"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I might say that the robust Members on the Minister&#146;s side have disappeared because they knew they would not be able to resist my arguments, but that is not very likely. The Minister&#146;s argument&#151;that this is to assist the Assembly to spread its wings, concentrate on scrutiny and so on&#151;is very seductive, but I am not actually seduced by it. If the Assembly needed the space it would have said so, rather than expressing its concerns, as it did, over these arrangements. There are a number of points where I am referring to the total number of posts, while the Minister is referring to individual appointments. The number of staff is a political matter. The GLA is not the same as other bodies, for reasons we debated earlier today, so it was a deliberate check that was designed.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000196"></a>The head of paid service, as other officers do, has the unenviable task of having to support and sometimes act as a go-between between the Mayor and the Assembly, and he has a responsibility facing both ways. He has to achieve a balance in the work he does. As on other occasions, I am making absolutely no comment about the current post-holder, who, much as many of us might wish to see him there for a long time, will not be there for ever.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000197"></a>The Minister seems to have said, and she might be able to confirm this now, that the new subsection (2), which she quotes in Clause 7(1), is about the overall establishment&#151;the overall number of posts&#151;and not just about individual appointments. I think I see nods coming from that direction.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000200"></a>Amendment No. 24 was one of those points that was answered as if it were about individual posts. It is not. It is intended to be&#151;and I apologise if this is not clear from the drafting&#151;about the establishment, not about individual posts, which might assist the Minister to look at it a little favourably.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000207"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07050112000320"></a>Baroness Hamwee</b> moved Amendment No. 25:</p>

<a name="70430-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000208"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 26 and to Clause 8. This need not detain us for as long and I hope it will give  the Minister an opportunity to explain the need for the clause, which concerns the mechanisms for the appointment of the head of paid service. If I were a conspiracy theorist, which I am not, I could construct a scenario in which the Mayor might use a veto over the appointment of a particular candidate and by those means eventually get a head of paid service who would either do the Mayor&#146;s bidding or not be very strong. It is therefore appropriate to ask the Minister to justify the clause.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000209"></a>In particular, I refer to the issue of delegation which the head of paid service can undertake. Amendment No. 26 would provide for the unanimous view of the Assembly. The Committee will not need to be reminded that a number of the Assembly are of the Mayor&#146;s party. None could be described as biddable, but they would tend to support the Mayor as a sort of default mode. They are also responsible for the role of the Assembly and, along with all other Assembly Members, they agree that if the head of paid service is given these new powers, he should exercise them personally and not be able to delegate the power to create or delete posts from the establishment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000210"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07050112000321"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> We have just had a long and detailed debate about the current staffing arrangements in the GLA, so I shall not go over that ground again. Clause 7 provides for the head of paid service to appoint the majority of the GLA&#146;s staff and set their terms and conditions following consultation with the Mayor and the Assembly. Clause 8 allows the head of paid service to delegate any of his staffing functions to a member of staff of the authority other than to staff appointed by the Mayor. These are sensible changes which separate the administrative function of appointing staff and the Assembly&#146;s primary role of scrutinising the Mayor.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000211"></a>Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 would place restrictions on the head of paid service in relation to his staffing role. The problem is that they are unworkable. Amendment No. 25 would prohibit the head of paid service from delegating his staffing function. This would have the unfortunate and impractical effect of requiring the head of paid  


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC56"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column GC56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>service himself to appoint GLA staff. That would not be the best use of his time, but that is the effect of the amendment. I can assure noble Lords that any delegation by the head of paid service in terms of appointments means a delegation of action, not of responsibility or accountability. He will remain responsible, but he would delegate the actions necessary to allow decisions to take effect. The head of paid service will remain responsible for overall GLA staffing provision irrespective of him delegating specific staff appointment responsibilities to other GLA officers.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000212"></a>Amendment No. 26 would prohibit the Mayor from delegating the duty set out in Amendment  No. 24, to give the Assembly 28 days&#146; written notice before he takes decisions on staff appointments. I believe it is reasonable to allow the head of paid service to be responsible for the administrative functions of the authority and to free up the Assembly&#146;s time. If the head of paid service is to take on this role, one that is analogous with what happens in other local authorities, it seems only sensible that he is able to delegate the function of making appointments while remaining responsible and accountable for the overall GLA establishment.</p>

<a name="70430-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07050112000213"></a>I hope that this explanation is of help to the noble Baroness. If not, or if I have missed something, I will be happy to write to her in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="07050112000214"></a><b><a name="70430-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07050112000322"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> Again, this is a matter of distinguishing between the size of the establishment and the making of individual appointments. One would not expect the head of paid service to carry out every interview, but delegating decisions about the number of posts is a different matter. Those dedicated Members of the Committee who have stayed to this point may be relieved to hear that I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="07043011000077"></a>The Ministry of Defence has agreed to lower the threshold for the advertising of MoD contracts.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="07043011000079"></a>The changes to this will be phased in. On 30 April 2007, the threshold for &#147;warlike&#148; requirements will be lowered to &#163;93,000. On 30 June 2007, this threshold will be lowered once more to &#163;40,000. The threshold for &#147;non-warlike&#148; requirements will also be reduced to &#163;40,000 on 30 June 2007. Furthermore, from 30 June, MoD project teams will be encouraged to consider advertising requirements with values as low as &#163;20,000.

The cost payable is that charged by Royal Mail Group to carry postal packets from local post offices to the British Forces Post Office depot at Mill Hill, London. This means that the overall cost of postage to operational theatres is fixed at the standard UK inland rate for packages up to 2 kilogrammes (currently &#163;5.31 for a 2 kilogramme packet), which are dispatched by surface mail; an air mail service is also available. However, for operational reasons an airmail-only service is operated to Iraq and Afghanistan. The cost of this service is currently &#163;6.50 for a 2 kilogramme packet, which represents only 38 per cent of the Royal Mail Group

When the provision of goods and services in Iraq reached the required standard, the decision was taken to end the scheme on 8 April 2004. It was later reintroduced for a period of one month before Christmas 2004, and subsequently confirmed by the then Secretary of State for Defence, prior to Christmas 2005, that the government payment of Royal Mail Group charges in the pre-Christmas period was to become a standard element of the operational welfare package. The centrally funded posting dates for Christmas 2006 were 10 November to 8 December inclusive, for which Royal Mail Group charged the Government &#163;577,000; this sum does not include the costs for additional air transport and onward distribution that were also paid for by the Government.</p>

This figure does not include the cost of providing RAF transport, which delivers the majority of BFPO mail to operational theatres and permanent bases by air, or the costs incurred in distributing the mail to the individual addressees in theatre.

<a name="70430w0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a><a name="07043025000061"></a>The questions for the 2007 test were developed based on consultation with users of census data. The census test provides the opportunity to test new and updated questions and the test questions are not necessarily those which will be included in the census in 2011. It is apparent that demands for information from the census are greater than are likely to be able to be accommodated and difficult trade-offs will need to be made.</p>

<a name="70430w0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a><a name="07043025000062"></a>After the 2001 census there was strong demand for information, especially on Welsh identification&#151;and a national identity question was introduced into government surveys such as the labour force survey from 2001 onwards. National identity information is used to measure identification with different countries of the UK, as well as nations outside the UK. The question being used for the 2007 census test specifically lists the national identities of the UK and Ireland in order to meet specific user requirements and also to harmonise with proposals for the question   


<notus-date day="30" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WA175"></a><b>30 Apr 2007 : Column WA175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be asked in the Northern Ireland census. Other national identities are able to be recorded using a write-in box. We know that the question requires more development before it can be included in the 2011 census. However we need to know now that it would meet the user requirements before carrying out further question testing.</p>

<a name="70430w0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a><a name="07043025000063"></a>Another reason for measuring national identity is to separate it from ethnic group, to make it possible to record national identity as &#147;British&#148; at the same time as recording ethnic group as, for example, &#147;Pakistani&#148;. There was criticism of the 2001 ethnic group question because the only category for British was listed under the heading &#147;White&#148;.</p>

<a name="70430w0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a><a name="07043025000064"></a>A question on ethnic group was first asked in the 1991 census for the prime purpose of identifying areas with high levels of ethnic minority groups in order to help provide valuable information for planning and provision of services and monitoring racial disadvantage and social exclusion.</p>

<a name="70430w0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a><a name="07043025000065"></a>The categories identified in the current ethnic group question being used in the test have been developed from the frame of the 2001 census question which itself had resulted from an extensive programme of research and development. The question has adopted that mix of geographic origin and colour characteristics that testing had shown to be publicly most acceptable and from which the most useable statistics could be obtained. A separate &#147;Irish&#148; response category was included in the 2001 census ethnic group question as a result of representations made by census users, particularly from Irish community groups, for information to help monitor discrimination and measure health inequalities among the &#147;Irish&#148; population. Whilst ethnicity is clearly a dynamic characteristic when considered nationally&#151;and the census must seek to reflect this as much as possible&#151;an equally important criterion is the ability to compare the results from one census to another&#151;and to that end the question must retain a degree of comparability over time.</p>

<a name="70430w0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a><a name="07043025000066"></a>We have recently conducted further consultation on user needs for information on ethnicity, national identity, and also language and religion from the 2011 census in England and Wales. This has focused in particular on assessing public acceptability of the descriptions of the ethnic categories. The relevant documents are available on the National Statistics website (see www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/cn_ 155.asp).</p>

<a name="70430w0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a><a name="07043025000067"></a>It is likely that the ethnicity classification will be updated for the 2011 census but it is not possible to confirm what questions and response categories are to be included until the consultation and testing programme is complete and formal approval is given by Parliament in 2010. A White Paper setting out the Government's proposals including the wording of any questions about ethnicity and identity is scheduled to be published in 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_16"></a><a name="07043025000072"></a>This target is unlikely to be met. In a recent communication, the Commission announced its intention to require industry to meet an efficiency target for 2012 through legislation. This would entail a target of 130g/km through improvements to the main structure of the car itself, and several other measures (for example, tyres with lower rolling resistance, and use of biofuels) contributing further savings, to make the target an equivalent of 120g/km.</p>

The Commission's proposal is still in its early stages: further detail on the mechanism of the target and how it would be implemented is yet to be decided. While we believe that the target is at around the right level, clearly this is a matter that will need careful thought and will involve much discussion with stakeholders. We have already started engaging with the key industry body in the UK, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and will continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_156"></a><a name="07043025000232"></a>In the March 2005 Budget, the Chancellor announced the establishment of the UK Stem Cell Initiative (UKSCI). A task force led by Sir John Pattison developed a vision and costed strategy, covering the period 2006 to 2015, to make the United Kingdom a global leader in stem cell research. The UKSCI report was published in December 2005 and made 11 recommendations. In their response, the Government accepted the recommendations in full. As a result, the Government have allocated an additional &#163;50 million, bringing total investment up to &#163;100 million, for stem cell research between 2006 and 2008.</p>

It also noted the potential concerns over the safety and efficacy of other types of stem cell therapies and recommended specialist research ethics committee oversight of pioneering trials of stem cells. Some stem cell clinical trials will already fall under the remit of the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee. Its membership has been strengthened to provide oversight of other relevant stem cell clinical trials and to act as a source of expert advice to researchers and other research ethics committees.</p>

In the consultation document <I>Building a Greener Future</I> issued on 13 December 2006, the Government proposed improvements in the requirements by 25 per cent in 2010 and of 44 per cent in 2013 leading to a zero-carbon standard in 2016. The response is still being analysed. Before any amendment is made the detailed proposals will be subject to formal consultations, and they will include a review of the provision for works on existing homes as well as new construction. The building regulations do not address fuel poverty.</p>

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's global opportunities fund currently disperses around half a million pounds under its Reuniting Europe programme in Ukraine, including to projects that support Ukraine's policy of EU integration, particularly in the field of improved governance. The Council of Europe supports Ukraine's democratic development through regular monitoring of its obligations and commitments.

PCBs are practically insoluble in water. Available data for aquatic life indicate effects on mortality, growth and reproduction at concentrations of 8 micrograms/litre. There is little information on the effects on sheep or cattle, nor on the endocrine-disrupting effects of PCBs on aquatic life. A single oral dose of 1 to 1.3 grams of Aroclor 1254 per kilogram of bodyweight has been reported as sufficient to kill half a group of treated rats.</p>

The TDI is based on the most sensitive end-point and will protect against the risk of other adverse effects.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_185"></a><a name="07043025000311"></a>After reviewing the animal toxicity data on commercial PCB mixtures, COT concluded that the most critical effects&#151;that is, those seen at the lowest level of exposure&#151;are those on the skin, the immune system, reproduction and postnatal behavioural development. It was not possible to derive no adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for these effects from the available data but it is possible to derive lowest observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) by means of tests on animals. A LOAEL of 5 micrograms (micrograms)/kg bw/day for Aroclor 1254 was identified for effects on the skin and on the immune system, while the effect on the reproductive system was considered to lie in the range from 5 to 30 micrograms/kg bw/day.</p>

Since then, the phase-out of any remaining uses has been of PCBs sealed in older equipment and phase-out by 2010 is required by EU legislation. Action has been taken at both national and global level; the UK is a signatory to the Stockholm convention, a global treaty signed by 151 countries with the objective to protect human health and the environment from a range of 12 chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants including PCBs. Under the convention the use, manufacture, import and export of the 12 listed substances including PCBs is banned.</p>
