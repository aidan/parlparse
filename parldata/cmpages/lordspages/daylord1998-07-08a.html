<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Quirk </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80708-01_para0"></a>Whether they are satisfied with progress on improvements in teacher training.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80708-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  My Lords, the Government continue to attach great importance to raising the standards of teacher training as this is a key element in raising standards in our schools. We have introduced new standards and a national curriculum for initial teacher training. Ofsted will be inspecting providers to ensure that our requirements are being met and that all training is of a high standard. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools will be reporting on the effectiveness of those measures. At least a third of the &#163;505 million 1998-99 Standards Fund is for expenditure on in-service training, in recognition of teachers' crucial role in raising standards.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. If it is a truth now universally acknowledged that no one forgets a good teacher, is it not also unfortunately a truth that no teacher can forget a bad teacher trainer? Now that we have from the TTA these admirable teacher-training programmes, does the Minister agree that a great deal still depends upon teacher trainers delivering accordingly? Is the Minister confident that teacher trainers have the ability and, indeed, the willingness so to do?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Quirk, that to deliver this ambitious new programme it is vital that teacher trainers are able to rise to the challenge. I believe that they are anxious and willing to do so and welcome that challenge. Of course, the training programmes will be regularly inspected by Ofsted. They will also be monitored by the TTA, which accredits all institutions which provide initial teacher training.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Macleod of Borve: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say how many men are being recruited to teach young children? In view of the fact that there are so many single parents, many children miss out on having a father. It would be helpful if there were more male teachers at the lower age level.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I entirely accept that it is desirable that we try to increase the number of men who teach in our primary schools, particularly at the lower age level. I believe that approximately <P>


<a name="column_1226"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1226</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>20 per cent. of primary teachers and a rather higher proportion of primary head teachers are men. However, we must do all we can to encourage young men to enter what is an enormously worthwhile profession.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Chelmsford; </B>   My Lords, I believe the Government accept the importance of teaching information and communication technology to teachers, not just so they can handle it, but also so that they can pass the benefits on to pupils. Can the Minister offer us any information on how that is moving forward?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, ICT--information and communications technology--is one of the subjects that will be taught from now on to all intending teachers. That is part of the reform in the curricula of teacher training organisations. Both primary and secondary school teachers will be expected to do an ICT course and that will start from this September.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for her earlier reply to the noble Lord, Lord Quirk. Many of us are concerned about the lack of liaison between training colleges and commerce and industry. We are now bringing more such liaison into partnerships with schools. Are we doing the same with the training colleges?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, there is increasing contact between the institutions responsible for training teachers and local commerce and industry. That is something the Government welcome and encourage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, in view of the continuing, worrying shortage of good teachers, have the Government given any further consideration to allowing mothers with good A-levels and degrees to teach with only a minimum of teacher training?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the Government are anxious to encourage mature people, whether men or women, into the teaching profession. Clearly, mothers whose children are old enough to allow them to work full time are in a category that we should be encouraging. But it is the Government's view that they should be properly trained before they become registered teachers working in the classroom. That would require them to take a one-year course. The Government are encouraging the development of more part-time PGCE courses, again to support that category.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, a long time ago I recall being surprised and somewhat disturbed to read advertisements for people to become lecturers in teacher training and to see in the advertisement that "teaching experience is not essential". Can my noble friend assure the House that those who are to be involved in this ambitious and necessary programme of teacher training are themselves able to show successful teaching experience?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that question. It is essential that those <P>


<a name="column_1227"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1227</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>involved in the training of teachers are well qualified and experienced in teaching. I have not seen advertisements of that kind for a long time. I can reassure my noble friend that the teacher training agency responsible for the accreditation of these courses would not take kindly to an advertisement of that sort.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree with the teacher representatives that there is a recruitment and retention problem at the moment? With the endless billions of pounds that will flow from the Treasury next week following the announcement that is to be made to Parliament, should not the teachers enjoy at least a share of that money in order to address specifically the problem of recruitment and retention?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has anticipated the money that may be flowing from the Treasury next week. She is obviously more familiar with its decisions than I am. However, having said that, it is extremely important that we do everything we can to promote improved recruitment and retention of teachers, especially good teachers. I shall bear in mind what she has said on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that one problem with retention and recruitment is that today's teachers have to deal not just with difficult children but with difficult parents as well? How does she think the teaching profession can encourage a sense of partnership so that teaching is not just left to the teachers but that parents are fully involved in making schools successful?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I very much agree that part of the job of a teacher today is not just to work with pupils but to work with their parents. It is important that in preparing teachers for their role that element of the job should be incorporated into the training they are given. It is also important that in-service training provides opportunities for teachers who want to specialise in the pastoral side of the job, especially in secondary schools.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80708-01_para1"></a>Whether they will consider restoring a right to income support and housing benefit during the long vacation to students who are orphaned or estranged from both their parents.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80708-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, although this particular group is not mentioned in a recent report by the Social Security Advisory Committee on student provision, a ministerial taskforce was established to consider the support available to care leavers, some of whom may be orphaned or estranged from both parents and in full-time education. The advisory committee's report raised a wide range of student issues. In due course, we will lay <P>


<a name="column_1228"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that report before the House, together with our response and regulations, as a Command Paper. Those regulations will be subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses and your Lordships will have the opportunity to debate them fully at that time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew19"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for offering a tiny chink of hope. Is he aware that no student can live for 52 weeks without a home to go to on simply grant and loan together? Is he further aware that students looking for work face the same chance of failing to get it as everyone else? Is he aware, therefore, that students who are orphaned or estranged from their families go through their undergraduate years in perpetual danger of having to withdraw from their studies through no fault of their own? Does he think that that is fair on people whose lives are difficult enough already?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, financial support from educational maintenance grants and student loans is intended to provide for the whole year. However, life is not as simple as that, as the noble Earl has pointed out. In these cases help is available from the access funds. Those funds are available to institutions of higher education so that they can provide selective help to certain students who have serious financial difficulties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Warnock: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the number of young people between the ages of 19 and 21 seeking to go to university is dropping and that the number of mature students has already dropped considerably? Does he not agree that to disadvantage the most vulnerable students will increase this tendency, which in itself is extremely worrying?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I cannot agree that the most vulnerable students are disadvantaged because there are special arrangements for vulnerable students. Vulnerable students--for instance, students who are under 19, students who have parental responsibilities and students who have other problems--are entitled to certain social security benefits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the maintenance grant and everything else that is provided by no means cover the whole year? Is he further aware that, although the access funds have been increased, they are far too small to cover this problem, where one is looking at a need for at least &#163;500? Most people receive only about &#163;250 at the most from the access funds and very many people are, for different reasons, entitled to it. I urge the Minister to consider either greatly increasing the access funds or taking action of the kind proposed by the noble Earl.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, access funds have been doubled for the coming academic year. In addition, in the coming academic year access funds will be available to part-time students for the first time. This is a matter for the academic institutions, but I note what the noble Baroness has said.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that the access funds have been increased. Do the Government have any idea of the numbers of students who are affected at the moment? In looking at the problem, will they balance the responsibility on young people to try to find work for themselves with the counterbalance of providing for those who are most vulnerable and need additional help?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, the department estimates that about 60 per cent. of students had part-time work during the summer or winter vacation. Most other students seemed to manage with the help of parental gifts and other help from god-parents, companies or whatever. The matter is under consideration. When the advisory committee reports we shall have the opportunity to debate the matter in more detail.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for what he said about the increase in the access funds. Is he aware that the experience of the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, that what is available is simply nowhere near enough to go round is the universal experience of every academic with whom I have spoken?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the noble Earl's view. This is a matter which the committee is taking into consideration at this very moment.

<A NAME="80708-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sandberg </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80708-02_para0"></a>Whether they are considering steps to modify European Union medicine legislation with regard to horses, due to come into effect in January 2000, in light of the tradition of horse welfare in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80708-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, maximum residue limits (MRLs) are set for veterinary medicines in food-producing species in order to protect consumers. We have been guided by a statement by the European Commission that, if a horse is not destined for human consumption, MRLs are not required. We will, of course, continue to play our full part in discussions to address any difficulties. It might be helpful if I quote just two sentences from the Commission statement of March 1994. It states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If national authorities are able to guarantee that a horse will not be destined for human consumption MRLs are not required. It is not the intent of the regulatory authorities to deprive veterinarians of the possibility of treating animals. When the guarantees can be given that horses will not be consumed, there is no obligation for any form of MRL".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sandberg: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that very helpful reply. I am not sure that veterinary practitioners in the country will be entirely reassured. They believe that after the year 2000 the medicines they will be able to administer to horses will be greatly reduced. They do not believe that the producers will <P>


<a name="column_1230"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1230</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have the market which will encourage them to seek the MRLs that they need. Can the Minister say what the other EU countries are doing? For instance, France has a thriving racing industry and a thriving industry in horses for consumption. Can the noble Lord say what he feels about that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is correct. It is a larger problem in certain other member states where we know many more horses are kept for food production. Therefore, it is more difficult to provide a guarantee that a horse is not intended for human consumption. The European Commission recognises that. In most member states the guarantees are likely to be possible only for high value horses. It is a problem in Ireland, France, Spain and Germany in particular. Potentially, it is a difficulty for all member states. We are in discussion with the Commission and it is aware of the matter. We are relying at the moment on the statement of March 1994.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </B>   My Lords, despite the statement of the Commission that horses not destined for the food chain can have drugs provided for them, is the Minister aware that, despite the extension of time--which has been called a "derogation"--allowed for medicinal products to comply with Regulation 2377/90 the demands of the European Commission may be such that manufacturers would rather discontinue the production of drugs than expend the amount of money required to determine an MRL, thus depriving the veterinarian of valuable drugs? In view of that, will Her Majesty's Government consider pressing further the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products to allow MRLs developed for the major food producing species to be applied to the horse with minimal comparative data?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, yes. It is a fact that the market in this country will be substantial, and for certain products it might be sufficient to encourage manufacturers to continue to produce the drugs. It is true that the European Committee for Veterinary and Medicinal Products has developed what is known as the minor species policy, which includes the horse. It allows the MRLs developed for major species such as cattle, sheep and pigs to be extended to horses and other species by providing the relatively cheap comparative data. That should ensure that a range of medicines will be available with MRLs and associated withdrawal periods for use with horses irrespective of their destination, whether or not they are intended for human consumption.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Allenby of Megiddo: </B>   My Lords, will Her Majesty's Government consider setting up a working group to consider the whole question of medicines and MRLs for the benefit of horses in future?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, I believe that we already have it, but it is not called a working group. The officials <P>


<a name="column_1231"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concerned are working extremely closely with the Commission, which is aware of the differing problems of the member states of the EU.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew16"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that if this directive or regulation were to be fully enforced, according to the views of the British Equine Veterinary Association, it would set back equine medicine by 40 years? For instance, treatments for colic, anaesthesia and a certain amount of antibiotics would not be allowed to be used on horses, but they could be used on their 12 year-old riders. Because in this country we have a large number of immensely sentimental horse owners who care for their horses, does the Minister agree that if Her Majesty's Government wish to retain the votes of the affluent middle classes in the South East this is something they should take very seriously?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, this Government are concerned about votes in all parts of the country. This is a problem; the noble Earl is correct. The Commission has recognised that, and I have already quoted from its statement. There should be no problem if the horse is not destined for human consumption. The drugs are available and can be used as long as the vet, at the time of treatment, is satisfied that the horse is not going for human consumption. If it is, then it is correct that the controls should be applied because of the danger to the consumer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Lord tell the House whether this legislation was introduced as a regulation or as a directive and whether it was taken under the qualified majority vote system? If so, how did the votes stack up?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, as a regulation it was introduced under QMV. I am not briefed as to the voting on that occasion, which was in 1990. I shall find out and write to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the problem is not within the bounds of this country, but that it is a European problem? Fortunately, in this country we love our horses and ride and enjoy them. We do not eat them. As regards horses which are exported, there is a suggestion--I do not know whether the Minister will consider it--that the horses can be tagged to indicate that they have received drugs, or the carcass can be kept for three months after the drug was used and then the carcass would be fit for human consumption. Can the Minister say whether any of these measures has been considered?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the prospect of a three months' delay on the use of a horse carcass boggles the imagination. There are four ways in which this matter can be dealt with and they are being investigated. There is the marking of the animal. In farming terms, they are freeze-branded. There is the possibility of a passport to be attached to the animal. There is also the possibility <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>of the micro-chip. Various ways are being investigated to ensure that the horse is not destined for human consumption. If that is the case then the vet can treat it.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80708-03_para0"></a>What priority is being given by the Department for International Development, in relation to women's sexual and reproductive rights, to provide further relevant services, including education, in the poorest countries.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80708-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the Government's White Paper on international development highlighted the priority given by this Government to the international development goals, including reproductive healthcare, information and services for all by 2015, and universal basic education by the same date. We want to ensure that all women, as well as men, can exercise their rights to the education, information and services necessary to control their fertility, protect their sexual health and raise healthy and educated children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Does he share my concern that the lack of access for millions of couples to family planning and reproductive health services in many parts of the world result in very high maternal mortality rates? Will the Government redouble their efforts to persuade the US and other governments to match our contribution to the development of such services in poorer countries?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I share the noble Lord's concern that millions of people around the world still do not have access to those basic services. However, there have been some significant improvements; 57 per cent. of couples around the world now use some form of contraception compared with 9 per cent. 30 years ago. In countries such as Bangladesh that has resulted in the number of children per family decreasing from seven to three. With regard to the American position, we regret the restrictions which have been put, through that country's internal political processes, on such provisions. America has historically invested substantially in this area and we hope that it will change its mind and do so again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that in Afghanistan women receive no education whatever, as Ms Carol Bellamy of UNICEF re-emphasised this morning at a meeting of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group? Will the Government consult, particularly with Islamic faiths in the OIC, to see whether additional pressure could be brought to bear on the Taliban and whether it could be explained that the education of women is fully compatible with the rules of Islam?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware of the desperate situation of many women in Afghanistan. We <P>


<a name="column_1233"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>shall use all our diplomatic influence to try to ensure that changes are made there. It is important to recognise that that situation does not appertain in the vast majority of Islamic countries, as is shown by the example of Bangladesh that I have just given.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, following the question from the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, does the Minister agree that this is not only a problem in the poorest countries but that, as Mr. Nemir Kidar said recently, it is a problem throughout much of the Arab world? How will the department encourage better education for women in all such countries in order to assist their liberalisation, which is surely at the root of the problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the central point raised by the noble Baroness and that education plays a major role in this. Encouraging girls to stay on at school for at least as long as boys has a direct effect on their knowledge of this subject and consequently on the number of births in such countries and the safety of those births. There is a particular problem in some Arab countries, but the priority of the British aid programme will remain the poorest countries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that following the Cairo Conference the European Union allocated 300 million ecus for expenditure on women's reproductive health rights by the year 2000? Is he also aware that currently there is insufficient expertise and administrative capacity in the unit controlling that money for it to be able to deploy those sums effectively? Will my noble friend ensure that that matter is put on the agenda of the Council of Europe so that we can be assured that the money is spent effectively, perhaps by bringing in expertise from countries such as the United Kingdom which has considerable experience in this area?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the situation with regard to the European Union's programme. The Commission has exceeded its target expenditure commitment of 300 million ecus, which followed Cairo, but there are some problems over allocation and with regard to the prioritisation of the programme. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has drawn those problems to the attention of the Commission and other member states. We are helping the network of experts who are helping the Commission to improve the effectiveness of its programmes in this area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Craigavon: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister comment on the total resources which the Government are devoting to this area of reproductive health? Are the present Government building on what in my opinion was the excellent record of the previous government in increasing the department's total expenditure on this to something like 4 per cent. of the total expenditure on overseas development aid, which is the internationally agreed target? Have we reached that target or are we still aiming at it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, both the previous government and this Government have increased the <P>


<a name="column_1234"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proportion of our total aid budget which is directed at health education in this area from 1.5 per cent. at the time of the Cairo Conference to almost 4 per cent. now. However, our view is that that is not necessarily the only way to tackle the problem because broader health education and broader education in general contribute to the ultimate success of our policy on reproductive health.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew13"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the right of women to receive or to refuse contraception is equally a human right? Might it be easier to obtain international agreement if we were to proceed on that human rights basis?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Earl. Both are clearly human rights and both should be respected in any health programme that we support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew15"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   My Lords, is there not a critical link not only between reproductive health and education, but also between population and employment, and particularly the employment of women because of the security that that can bring their families? Are the Government aware that the White Paper says very little about that connection with employment although it says a lot about women and gender equality? Can the Government do more to redress that imbalance and to support more income-generation programmes relating to population?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the emphasis of the White Paper and of our strategy on the education of women and their role in the economy is clear. The direct effect of Her Majesty's Government's efforts in this area may be a little unclear. Nevertheless, part of our programme is to ensure the full participation of women in developing countries in economic and social life as a whole without, however, the exploitation which has often previously characterised their participation.

<A NAME = "80708-03_para4"></a>[The CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES in the Chair.]
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para5"></a>Clause 1 [The Scottish Parliament]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 8, at end insert ("which shall consist of two chambers.
<BR>
(1A) This Act makes provision for the establishment, composition and powers of the lower chamber of the Scottish Parliament, and (other than in subsections (1) to (1B) of this section and in section (Second chamber of the Scottish Parliament)) references to "the Parliament" and "the Scottish Parliament" shall be construed as references to the lower chamber.
<BR>
(1B) Section (Second chamber of the Scottish Parliament) makes provision relating to the establishment of a second chamber of the Scottish Parliament.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 1, perhaps I should begin by saying that it may be quite some time before we reach Amendment No. 391! This amendment and the others grouped with it essentially seek to introduce a second chamber into the Scottish parliamentary arrangements and a method by which we might arrive at the composition of that second chamber. I decided that it was perhaps wise not to suggest that those of your Lordships with Scottish residence should form the second chamber. I thought that the Government might find that a little too easy to knock down with the usual lines that, as we know, come spinning out of Downing Street from time to time. That is why I have suggested that the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, should set up a commission of not more than 15 members who would take evidence, discuss the issue, and come to conclusions, perhaps with options which they would present to the Government and to Parliament. We could then proceed to create a second chamber for the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para7"></a>At Second Reading a number of your Lordships pointed out that the proposals before us did not envisage a second chamber, but a unicameral parliament. A number of your Lordships expressed some concern about that and I have no doubt that we shall hear that concern again today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para8"></a>We all know the arguments in favour of a revising chamber--although perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, is not quite as sympathetic to that argument today as he might have been at this time yesterday! However, assuming that the noble Lord takes such matters in reasonably good humour, I believe that he will find the argument for a second Chamber compelling. The very fact that the Government have made it clear that they do not want the current composition of this House to continue but that they do want this House to continue indicates that they believe that there is a place in our system for a second chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para9"></a>One knows that all governments use this House considerably during the passage of legislation, and it is upon that that I wish to concentrate. Noble Lords do other things. This Chamber has Question Time and considers secondary legislation. That is a function that could be performed by a second chamber of the Scottish parliament. Noble Lords also have a particular role regarding European legislation. That is something that <P>


<a name="column_1236"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1236</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>your Lordships do uniquely among parliaments, unicameral and bicameral, around the rest of the European Union.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para10"></a>However, the main daily task--I nearly said "daily grind"--of noble Lords is to look at legislation. Under all governments in this Chamber amendments have been proposed from the Opposition, the Cross-Benches and the Government. Recently, in a lecture on the House of Lords I learnt--I presume it to be right--that in this Session the Government themselves will have chalked up about 2,000 amendments in your Lordships' House on legislation. That does not include amendments that have been moved from other parts of the House. Most of them have been accepted by the Government without Division, and a few have been forced upon the Government. I do not know whether I have amended this Bill to the extent that the Welsh Bill is being amended, but I have tabled a significant number of amendments in your Lordships' House which are perhaps the result of undertakings in the Commons or points raised in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para11"></a>No one in this House can doubt that this system depends upon the existence of a second chamber in order to iron out the problems of legislation and to give the Government the opportunity to listen to the arguments, and make the necessary changes, not only in this House but outside. In the sister (or cousin) Welsh Bill the Government have tabled a number of very significant and welcome amendments. One day about 37 or 38 of the 70-odd pages of the Marshalled List were taken up by government amendments. It is perfectly clear that in our system the second chamber plays a vitally important role. No doubt the Committee will be told that not every system has two chambers. That is certainly true. There are parts of the world where only one chamber exists and they appear to get along perfectly well; in other parts of the world there are two chambers and they appear to get along perfectly well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para12"></a>The argument from the Government Benches on a number of constitutional issues that irritates me most is that it is done one way in one country and a different way in another country, that we should copy what everybody else is doing and that we do not have enough confidence to stand by our own traditions and methods. Some of them may appear to be fairly arcane to people outside this country but those methods have grown up over hundreds of years of democracy--which is a lot more than can be said for many of the countries whose constitutional arrangements we are asked to copy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para13"></a>Every country exercises its democracy in a different way because of its history, size and the way in which its political parties have grown up. All these issues determine how our constitutional arrangements work. I do not believe that just because Norway, Sweden and Finland--to name the three that I suspect we shall hear a good deal about--have unicameral parliaments, we must do the same here. In the wintertime they have endless nights. It does not mean that we should try to do the same here, although some wish to muck about with the clock in order to bring that about in this country. We are all different. I am all for these differences. I do not suggest to these countries that they <P>


<a name="column_1237"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1237</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should adopt bicameral parliaments. That is their business. Therefore, it is to our traditions and way of working that we should look.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para14"></a>No doubt the Government will say that a new Scottish parliament, which after all will be a legislature, should look at different ways of working and does not have to carry on the traditions that have been pursued in the United Kingdom Parliament. As the Civil Service and the mindset of most of us is formed by a system that has been in operation for centuries in this country the chances are that the Scottish parliament will continue to operate along the lines of the House of Commons as far as concerns legislation. Even in the case of ordinary legislation, unless it is agreed by all channels--when it is agreed by all channels there is probably greater scrutiny--it takes about three or four months. We are aware from our experience in this Parliament that that is not really enough. Another two or three months are required in the other Chamber if we are to get it right. We do not always succeed even then, given the fact that there are two bites at the cherry. Two different sets of people look at legislation and a bit more time is allowed for the Government to consider and reflect upon what has been said. I suggest to the Committee that in this country legislation is greatly improved by the existence of a second chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para15"></a>I have little doubt that we shall be told that the Scottish parliament can use other methods. Later on we shall be investigating some of those other methods, but I do not believe that we should leave that to chance. The second chamber deserves at least consideration. I am not particularly thirled as to how it should be composed. I do not believe that it should be composed as a reflection of the first chamber. Perhaps it could be elected on a different basis from the first chamber. For example, one person for every unitary authority may give more weight in the whole system to the rural areas of Scotland than to the heavily populated Central belt. Under that system Glasgow, Orkney and Shetland, the Western Isles and so on would each have one member. It would not be entirely balanced because the Highland Region, which is fairly large, would have one member. I am not thirled to any particular method. But there is one method that we can certainly use. Members could be appointed. Some governments make very sensible appointments to your Lordships' House in the way of Life Peers. I am quite sure that a way can be found whereby a small number of people who represent various interests in Scotland are brought together to perform the role of a second chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para16"></a>However, the object of my amendment is not to determine the composition of the second chamber. That will be decided by a commission which will report on the issue. My main proposition is that we should make provision for that to happen under the Bill and debate whether or not there should be a second chamber. If we are not to have a second chamber, we should debate how the checks and balances that a second chamber would provide under this and many other systems can be provided in the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para17"></a>Unlike the Welsh assembly, the Scottish parliament will be passing primary legislation across a very wide field for the people of Scotland. That singles it out as a <P>


<a name="column_1238"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1238</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>different body from the Welsh assembly. I have not made proposals similar to those of my noble friend Lord Roberts of Conwy in respect of the Welsh Bill because I do not believe that the position is the same. In Scotland one is considering a legislature with considerable powers over a very wide field. For that reason I believe it is right that in this Chamber, if not in the other, we should at least discuss whether or not there is merit in having some form of second chamber in the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para18"></a>I look forward to hearing the Minister's response. I hope that he will address the general question of how legislation is to be dealt with. That will be useful for the later stages of the Bill when we try to ensure that any vague promises about how legislation is to be dealt with are put on the face of the Bill and not just left to a wing and a prayer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-03_para19"></a>This is a useful debate to begin with because the British tradition, as I started by saying and conclude by saying, is that we should have two Houses--a second Chamber that is a revising Chamber which does not compete with the other place but complements it. It would enhance the system of government we are developing in Scotland. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   I listened to the noble Lord with great interest. I might have misunderstood his demeanour or body language from this distance, but I thought I saw a little bit of a twinkle in his eye when he moved the amendment and thought it was a little bit tongue in cheek. If I follow his argument for a second Chamber, it is very thin. He says that the problem is that the parliamentary draftsmen do not always get it right. I cannot speak with any great experience in this House and I would not wish to make a value judgment on how well this House revises legislation. It is my very strong view, having spent 27 years in the other place, that there legislation is very inadequately discussed. The Committee stages can last for days and long nights and seem to have been turned not into revising sessions but into arguments on principle to prevent Bills getting through. This to some extent reflects the adversarial nature of the House of Commons, with a government and an opposition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para0"></a>All oppositions behave broadly in the same way. Whatever governments put forward, oppositions feel obliged to oppose. The whole purpose of an opposition is to oppose. Other noble Lords may have the same experience. Very little practical discussion takes place. Will the situation be any better in the Scottish parliament? We do not know. There are some intriguing debates to follow on how the Scottish parliament will be elected. Clearly the thrust of the Scotland Bill is that there should be a building up of consensus and working together. I take the point made by the noble Lord that consensus and agreement are not always the best way to proceed, but if there is proper discussion about proceedings before the parliament and the issues to be discussed, we can make a lot of progress.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para1"></a>I am sure that it would be very difficult to do a check, but it would be interesting to know how many of the changes made to a Bill are because of genuine flaws in the operation of a Bill or part of a Bill and how many <P>


<a name="column_1239"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1239</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arise because Bills have been rushed before Parliament and inadequately drafted. The proposition which is advanced that there ought to be more legislative discussion is a way of avoiding the necessity for a second Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para2"></a>Intriguingly, the one point that the noble Lord did not mention is the division of responsibility--where an elected body has an authority which no appointed Chamber has. I do not intend to get into a discussion on the merits of a quango system to replace this Parliament or whether patronage for one generation is better than patronage over several generations, which is the only difference between hereditary and non-hereditary Peers. However, we must think carefully before setting up a body in the Scottish parliament which will rival its power and lead to all kinds of differences.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para3"></a>I am no expert on the American constitution, but my rudimentary knowledge of it is that the initial constitution had an elected congress and an appointed senate. It was always intended that the senate should be the junior partner of the two Houses. But it was said that an appointed system, however well it was defined and arranged to allow for difference in size and influence, would not be democratic. In this case the noble Lord has suggested one from Glasgow, one from Orkney and one from Shetland to redress the balance of the regions, and we will return to that point later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para4"></a>The Americans therefore arranged to have an elected senate. Whatever the reality of the American constitution, the fact is--although some constitutional experts disagree--that the senate is now the more powerful of the two Houses, which was never the intention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para5"></a>A second Chamber would bring back into the equation in Scotland an argument that has continued throughout its constitutional history and still continues: which of the two Houses of Parliament is superior? Is it the lower House which is elected or is it this House which is appointed or achieved in other ways? If it is elected the argument about power will become exacerbated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para6"></a>Leaving aside the theoretical argument, there are attractions to a second Chamber. However, the White Paper makes it quite clear that the new Scottish parliament should be up and running in 2000. There have been many discussions over the years as to whether there should be a Scottish parliament. There are noble Lords on the other side of the House who have blown hot and cold about it. However, during the Second Reading debate in this Chamber there was no head of steam about the necessity for a second Chamber. The matter was not discussed. It was discussed in some detail in the Scottish Convention, on which I served for a year, but it was concluded that we did not need a second Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para7"></a>If a commission is set up, it will take at least as long, if not longer, to arrive at an acceptable 15 members of the commission than it will to do the work. The noble Lord put the amendment forward in a beguiling manner, not because it is a wrecking amendment, because that would not be allowed and he would never dream of <P>


<a name="column_1240"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1240</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>doing anything like that. But I am sure that he has at the back of his mind the fact that it is a device to delay the day when the Scottish parliament is up and running.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para8"></a>I have no doubt that the new Scottish parliament will make mistakes--I cannot think of any legislature in the world that has not made mistakes--but it should start as soon as possible, with its powers clearly defined, so that there is no need for a second Chamber, with some degree of consensus and a willingness to ensure that legislation is brought forward with due thought and care and proper drafting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   It may seem rather churlish after the success of yesterday's Mackay/Steel partnership that I should rise so early in these debates in my more familiar role of disagreeing with the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, but I cannot commend the amendment to my noble friends.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para9"></a>There was one sentence in his remarks with which I did agree--when he said that the issue of a second Chamber ought to be considered. The first point that I should like to make is that it has been considered at length. I remind the noble Lord that the Minister of State during the Second Reading debate told us that the legislation with which we are now proceeding is based on the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. That convention sat not for weeks or months but for years, and the fact that the Conservative Party chose not to take part is a matter for the Conservative Party and not anyone else. They would have been welcome to participate in those discussions and they would have heard much discussion on this vexed question because it was thoroughly considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para10"></a>We rejected the idea of a second Chamber largely on grounds of cost and bureaucracy. We were very concerned, remembering the arguments that raged in the 1970s about extra layers of government; and that was the fundamental reason why it was rejected.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para11"></a>I pray in aid of that argument no less a person than Mr. Michael Ancram. I quote him not only because he is a former constituent of mine and a prospective Member of this place but because he is supposed to be the constitutional spokesman of the Conservative Party. On 19th May in the other place, he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In my view, there is no case for a second chamber in the Scottish context. We would all agree that, if anything, there is too much politics and that there will be all sorts of layers of politicians in Scotland. To create yet another layer would not meet with the approval of the Scottish people, whatever form it might take and whatever its context and powers".--[Official Report, Commons, 19/5/98; col. 744.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I could not put it better myself. If the noble Lord does not listen to me, he might at least listen to his colleague who is supposed to be the spokesman on these matters in the other place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para12"></a>The reason is clear when we look at the proposals for the parliament. Mr. Ancram conceded that other parliaments had unicameral legislatures, and those occur in countries with not dissimilar populations from that of Scotland--Denmark, Finland, New Zealand and others. That has to be considered. Moreover, if one looks at the proposals in the Bill and the White Paper, it is intended <P>


<a name="column_1241"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1241</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the consultation process of the Scottish parliament will be infinitely superior to the consultation processes we have here at Westminster.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para13"></a>Every Bill will have a much longer pre-legislative stage, and post-legislative scrutiny will be much more substantial. That should be borne in mind. An important point is that it has been agreed that each session of the Scottish parliament will last for a fixed term of 4 years, and that Bills can be carried over--something that does not happen in this place. There will be more time to scrutinise legislation. There will be no need to rush up against a July or October deadline. That should give us more confidence that the scrutiny of legislation in a unicameral parliament will be better than it is here at Westminster.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para14"></a>For all those reasons, I believe that we would be wise not to accept the amendment. Throughout these Committee proceedings, certainly on these Benches, we may at times be in disagreement with the Government or in disagreement with the Conservative Party, but we start from the proposition that, when in doubt on any issue, we should leave matters to the Scottish parliament itself. In years to come, the Scottish parliament may well look at the suggestions, for example, made by the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay of Cartvale, on Second Reading, when she talked about the situation in Norway where the elected parliamentarians divide themselves into two groupings. That could be. Let us leave that to the Scottish parliament in the fullness of experience. In the meantime, let us press on with getting it, first, legislated, and then elected.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lang of Monkton: </B>   I support the amendment and the proposal that there should be two chambers to the Scottish parliament. I was asking myself whether it was on cost or democratic grounds that the Government had rejected that option. I find it odd that they should reject it on democratic grounds since they have long complained that there was a democratic deficit so far as concerns Scotland. If indeed it is on the grounds of cost, as the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, suggested, I believe that cut-price democracy would lead to second rate legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para15"></a>The very fact that my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish was able to point out how many amendments have been brought forward, not just by opposition parties but indeed by government themselves, and accepted, in this place over the years underlines the value of having a chance to reflect and revise legislation in a second chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para16"></a>It has been suggested that without a second chamber there would be more time to consider legislation. That is an argument that cuts both ways. With a second chamber, the option of introducing legislation in that chamber and enabling it to pass down to the elected chamber applies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hughes, drew a comparison between the US Senate and Congress and what might happen in a Scottish parliament. I do not believe that that comparison is valid for a whole host of reasons which brief reflection would easily bring to the <P>


<a name="column_1242"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1242</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committee's attention. A better comparison might be the relationship between the other place and this place. It is clear that the elected Chamber is the senior Chamber and that this Chamber is secondary to it. That is something that has been acknowledged repeatedly during our debates, not least yesterday.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para18"></a>As I understand it, the Government's arguments centre around three points. The first is the arrangements that exist in various Scandinavian countries. My noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish answered that point effectively. We should seek what we believe is best for us in the light of our experience, legislative customs, and what we believe would best allow for reflective and well-considered legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para19"></a>The second argument is the proposal which we heard from the Government Benches on Second Reading and again just now from the noble Lord, Lord Steel. It is that there would be a far longer pre-legislative consultation period, and so legislation would be very much better before it reached the Scottish parliament. I am all in favour of pre-legislative consultation. Indeed, it was a feature of the White Paper, A Partnership for Good, which I laid before Parliament some years ago. It was then my intention that it should be done in the form of a special Standing Committee to take evidence from pressure groups and interested parties before all substantive Scottish legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para20"></a>It was first used in Scotland in the context, as I recall, of the Children (Scotland) Bill. That Bill was the product of many detailed reports, inquiries, causes celebres and other considerations. The Bill was the subject of extensive consultation before it went into Standing Committee. I do not believe that there is any evidence that the Act, as it finally appeared, has escaped the rigorous post-legislative analysis that so many Acts of Parliament receive, and which found shortcomings in it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para21"></a>Nor do I believe that it is right to compare pre-legislative consultation with post-legislative consultation. Before legislation, debate is less focused than after legislation. Before legislation, it is a matter of listening to pressure groups and those with vested interests. Post-legislative consideration of legislation in a second chamber allows for a more objective and dispassionate view of the sections in an Act, and also one that is better informed by the arguments that have already taken place, and by the focus on the issues of the legislation that emerge during that period.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para22"></a>The third argument that the Government have advanced against a second chamber is that somehow politics are all going to be different in a new Scottish parliament: they are going to be more inclusive; more consensual; everyone will be less adversarial and more friendly. If the Committee believes that, it will believe anything. I believe that the politics are likely to be more acrimonious, especially if there is only one chamber. One of the benefits that this distinguished Chamber brings to legislation is that debates take place in a less adversarial and a less acrimonious atmosphere. That has led to a substantial improvement in legislation over the years.

<A NAME = "80708-04_para23"></a>As to what form a second chamber would take, clearly there is here a huge debate which would have to be developed over a period of time, once the principle were accepted. I noted that the noble Lord, Lord Desai, who was in his place today, suggested that the second tier of members--the proportionately elected members--might form the second chamber. That would be an economical way of approaching the matter, but it would not get away from the party list, and the party divisions, and it would replicate, largely, the elected component on a constituency basis in the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para24"></a>My noble friend Lord Mackay suggests that there should be two separate chambers. That implies a whole new raft of individuals and costs. Clearly, those considerations should be taken into account. I do not believe that the argument that this place should act as a second chamber of the Scottish parliament should be too easily dismissed. It is surely not beyond the wit of Members of this place and the Government to find a way in which the strong interest in the affairs of Scotland, as a component nation within the UK, should have the opportunity to find expression in consideration of Scottish legislation emerging from the Scottish parliament. Clearly, the balance of powers has to be addressed carefully. There would be no purpose in this place acting as a second chamber to override the elected chamber in Scotland, any more than it would ultimately override on important issues of legislation the views of the elected Chamber within these Houses of Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-04_para25"></a>There is a possibility that this UK Parliament could continue to hold together the UK, so threatened by the Bill that we are debating. Every wall, every archway, and almost every panel in the building, carry on them the emblems of the countries that make up the UK. That is a reflection of the confidence that our Victorian forebears had in the role of these Houses of Parliament to reflect the interests of all the nations that form the UK. I do not believe that we should cast that aside lightly, as we are in danger of doing if we do not allow a second chamber to consider legislation in the Scottish parliament.

<A NAME="80708-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and others. I go slightly further in asking the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, to withdraw the amendment in the interests of his party. I think it quite remarkable that the Second Reading debate was the first time that the idea of a second chamber for the Scottish parliament was advanced. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, is right: we should not simply copy other legislatures. I do not believe that anyone on this side advocates that we copy one or other Scandinavian country just for its own sake. But the argument applies equally to Scotland vis-a-vis Westminster. The fact is that in so far as they could be consulted the Scottish people decided against having a second chamber. The Scottish convention was open to all to participate in. It is the most all-inclusive body I can recall. It went on for ever and ever. The Scottish people decided that they did not want a second chamber.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para0"></a>The Government's White Paper, published before the referendum, did not mention a second chamber. No groundswell of support for a second chamber was reflected in debates running up to the referendum. The Scottish people endorsed the White Paper fairly resoundingly in the referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para1"></a>In the circumstances, for the noble Lord's amendment to be put forward now, effectively delaying the introduction of the Scottish parliament for a minimum of a year or two years, will be construed by the Scottish people, perhaps unfairly, as meaning that the Conservative Party has not changed its spots on the devolution issue. That would be tragic. It is a great pity that the Conservatives are not represented in Scotland. It is not in the interests of democracy. The Scotland Bill throws them a life saver. It pulls them back literally from the grave. Short of an absolute cataclysm, the proportional representation proposals will ensure that the Conservatives have a voice in a Scottish parliament which they have been unable to earn in Westminster by the first-past-the-post electoral principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para2"></a>I should have thought that all noble Lords opposite would consider it in their interests to demonstrate that the Conservative Party has reverted to the party, after all, of Ted Heath, who made the Declaration of Perth in 1978, and of the late Lord Home who chaired a constitutional committee. Some eminent members of the committee unfortunately have switched sides on the issue. At the time they were strongly pro-devolution. The Conservative Party has an honourable tradition of devolution.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The noble Lord is good enough to give way. I remind him that the body over which Lord Home presided recommended merely a deliberative assembly with limited legislative power; namely, to consider the Committee stage of Scottish Bills emanating from Westminster and statutory instruments but on both heads giving Westminster the last word. It was different altogether from what is proposed by the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   By no means am I suggesting that the recommendation was a precursor of this Bill. However, in the past the Conservative Party has shown itself more willing to accept devolution, even of a more modest nature, than would appear to be the case at present. I thought that things had changed. Regrettably, the amendment will be interpreted as an attempt by the Conservatives to delay the introduction of a Scottish parliament. That will do the Conservative Party in Scotland no good whatever.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para3"></a>I shall not go over what the noble Lord, Lord Steel, said. It is important to recognise that the parliament will operate differently from Westminster. Quite apart from having fixed terms, and being able to carry over legislation, an all-important and a self-denying factor on the part of the Labour Party putting it forward was the introduction of proportional representation. Until recently the Labour Party could have been assumed a landslide majority in Scotland. Instead of proposing the first-past-the-post system, the Labour Party quite deliberately put forward proportional representation, <P>


<a name="column_1245"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1245</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>making it virtually impossible for any one party to govern without the co-operation of others. The absence of the adversarial principle, and the need for consensus to get any measure through, will make the Scottish parliament a very different body.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para4"></a>I fully agree with the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Lang. The idea that people will suddenly become a lot nicer to each other is hard to believe. It is difficult to see the Scottish media accepting non-confrontational politics. But at least the structure is in place to encourage it. Let us hope that it is successful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para5"></a>It is not in the interests of the Conservative Party to put forward the amendment. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, will have second thoughts and withdraw it. But let us be clear. The Government White Paper did not mention a second chamber; the Scottish convention did not mention it. Introducing it at this stage will do neither the Conservative Party nor this House any good. I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   I find it difficult to accept advice to the Conservative Party from the other side of the Chamber. Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes is one of the tags which lingers in most people's minds long after their schooling.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para6"></a>The point I wish to raise is a different one. Many references have been made to the experience of other countries. Scandinavian countries are emblazoned on the banners of the party opposite. I thought it would be of importance and interest to find out what another small country of great antiquity and culture was doing. I therefore left consideration yesterday of what I regard as the schools lowering of standards Bill and went to Chatham House to hear the newly elected president of the Czech Senate. The Czech Republic represents a cultural tradition in Europe as long as Scotland's. The Charles University was flourishing when the ancient Scottish universities, which are under such attack from Her Majesty's Government, were also flourishing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para7"></a>What did I discover? When the Czechs emerged from communist domination, they created a new democratic constitution. It provided for two chambers, one to be elected by proportional representation--a chamber of deputies, if you like, or a lower house--and a senate. But for some years the Czechs did not proceed to the creation of the senate. However, given the difficulties they were running into with their single chamber government, a senate was then produced. It is an upper house, elected by the much better device of first past the post and therefore possessing greater democratic legitimacy than the lower house.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para8"></a>I heard the lecture along with the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf. The powers in legislation are similar: both houses are involved in the legislative process. The important point is that constitutional changes--the electoral system, duration of legislatures--can take place only by agreement between the two houses. I believe that there is something to gained from that, as well as from the bleak wastes of Scandinavia.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   We are dealing with a matter of principle rather than the detail of what an upper or <P>


<a name="column_1246"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1246</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>second house should be. I wish to stick entirely to the principle rather than the detail. I sympathise entirely with the amendment. It seems to me perfectly sound. I advise the Government not to oppose it, but to think carefully about it and, under whatever arrangements of consideration are devised, to bring back some form of scrutiny of legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para9"></a>I say that because I have had experience of both Houses. I had only seven years in the other place but I have now had 20 years in this place. I am sure that the lower Chamber in our system is inadequate in its scrutiny of legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para10"></a>It is not to be blamed for that. It is inadequate because of the burdens which are placed upon it, on the one hand, and because of the nature of the adversarial party conflict which prevails in the other place. Because of the adversarial nature of that conflict, scrutiny is not scrutiny about the Bill; in another place, scrutiny is always about politics in some way. I do not wish to be philosophical here. I am referring to party politics, which is wholly and entirely non-philosophical.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para11"></a>The results are quite clear. Legislation comes before us which is inadequate. It may be inadequate because of the shortcomings of the parliamentary draftsman, although I would not say that. It may well be due to the shortcomings of the instructions which they are given. They do their best to transfer those instructions into something in the nature of legislation. We know from experience that legislation that comes before us has been inadequately digested and scrutinised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para12"></a>I do not know what the figures are. In this House we sometimes complain that the Government pay no attention to the amendments which we make. That is not true. Several hundred amendments go through from this House every Session. In fact, it may be more than a thousand every Session. Almost all of those amendments comes from the Government because they have realised how inadequate the legislation was and how inadequately it had been scrutinised in another place. They then try to put the matter right here. Those thousand or so amendments are usually accepted. There are the more exciting ones which are usually political in nature which cause a certain amount of fuss. We had some amusement just the other day. I voted with the Government then with my teeth gritted and my eyes shut. The Government were wrong, as they so often are. That is a feature of government. The party in government is almost always wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para13"></a>However, the Government get the big picture right. In this case, the big picture is the Scottish parliament. I nearly used the dread word "assembly" but I just managed to avoid it. The Minister is looking at me cunningly. The Government get the big picture right but they then get the framework within which the big picture is supposed to function wrong. They have got it wrong here again.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para14"></a>This matter of scrutiny is essential to our system. The only way in which it can be done is by having a second Chamber of some kind. I shall not attempt to describe what that second Chamber should be like or even to think about it at this moment. I am sure that the noble <P>


<a name="column_1247"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1247</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord, Lord Mackay, will think about it for me and present some plan to me at which I shall be able to look with my normal gaze.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para15"></a>But the weakness in the proposal is that there is to be some kind of pre-legislative committee which will look at the legislation which is coming forward. After it has looked at it and presented it, it will then be passed. That sounds great if you are very naive and young, as I am. But it is not wonderful because do not forget that the members of the pre-legislative committee will be the same people who will later pass legislation. If I know politicians--and I certainly do know them in view of the 45 years or so in which I have been in politics-- I find it incredible to imagine that they will change their minds in a few months, if ever. If any Member of the Committee knows a politician who has changed his mind, perhaps he will tell me before we take a vote.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-05_para16"></a>Therefore, I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, has a sound, pronounced, strong and irrefutable point. I plead with my colleagues on the Front Bench to harken to advice just this once. The Government have been in office for only a year or so and they have not listened to too much advice so far. However, the time is coming when advice must be heeded. I suggest that my noble friend begins now.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-06_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, has breathed a breath of fresh air into this afternoon's discussion. I could not help wondering whether he is not, like myself, a Suez rebel manque. In any event, he has been willing to challenge the view of his own side.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para0"></a>I turn now to the claim that what is before us has the blessing and even the benediction of the Scottish convention. That was a self-chosen body, worthy and eminent no doubt, but its members were not elected as far as I am aware. Therefore, their authority is at best empirical.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para1"></a>One aspect of the problem has not been raised so far and that is why I dare to rise to my feet. The previous Scottish parliament was a gathering of the Estates. The Estates did not by any means sit together. They represented different interests, including the higher echelons of the Church. The major boroughs had their representation. I wonder whether the reason that we still have right reverend Prelates in our House is not a relic of what was present in most medieval parliaments. Our own Parliament here began in the same way as the Scottish parliament, as a gathering of Estates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para2"></a>Therefore, my main concern is not the merits of having a second Chamber but the fact that Scottish history is being ignored. I am not aware whether the Scottish Estates ever quarrelled with one another. I am not sure that they did. My research has been rather inadequate in that regard. However, there were separate Estates which did not always sit together, and nor did they always sit at the same time. That was a feature also of medieval parliaments of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para3"></a>Therefore, the case for a second Chamber is not something to be laughed out of court. It can be extracted from Scotland's own indigenous history, and on that <P>


<a name="column_1248"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1248</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ground, as well as the grounds already advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, I support my noble friend's amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My noble friend Lord Howie asked whether we could show him a politician who had changed his mind. The mover of the amendment changed his mind. My good friend the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, laughs. We have had extensive experience of Scottish politics. I can recall the days when the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, was a Liberal candidate. He changed to become a Conservative candidate to win the seat, only to be defeated at the next election by a Liberal candidate. However, that is all in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para4"></a>I should say to the noble Earl, Lord Lauderdale, about the whole question of the Scottish Constitutional Convention that if we should not laugh out of court--and I do not believe we should--the proposal for a second Chamber, we should most certainly not laugh out of court the standing of the Scottish Constitutional Convention. My experience of that body--sharing the chairmanship with the noble Lord, Lord Steel--was that it was held in the highest regard by the people of Scotland and was recognised as a cross-party group, albeit that it excluded the Conservative Party and the Scottish National Party. But there were people from all sections of Scottish opinion working together to produce the document which it eventually produced, Towards Scotland's Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para5"></a>I suspect that we are today at the beginning of a fairly detailed and long debate. I do not mean that that debate is just for today; indeed, it will be a long debate during the months and years ahead about whether we should have single chamber government in Scotland or whether we should have a second chamber. In his contribution, the noble Lord, Lord Steel, said that the Scottish Constitutional Convention considered the whole question of a second chamber. That is absolutely accurate, there are no "ifs" or "buts" about it. The convention, under my chairmanship at that date, made its position clear when it rejected the proposal for a second chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para6"></a>I am still strongly connected to the convention, although I no longer share the chairmanship with the noble Lord, Lord Steel, because that honour now rests with my noble friend Lady Ramsay of Cartvale. I do not want to pretend or give your Lordships the impression that somehow or other during my time with the convention I thought that a second chamber would be a good idea. But one of my great weaknesses is that I keep thinking and sometimes my thoughts overtake those that I had a few years ago. Sometimes that leads to inconsistencies in my own approach to particular policies. Indeed, it leads me to the position today where I honestly believe that we should not decide the issue today. I have a feeling that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, will not want the issue decided today because it is far too important to decide on the basis of a debate lasting an hour or so. We need to give the matter the most serious consideration before we come to a decision as to whether or not there should be a second chamber. However, that is not an excuse, far less a reason, for <P>


<a name="column_1249"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1249</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>delaying the implementation of the Scottish parliament. That parliament is due to be up and running by July 1999, and nothing should stand in the way of it meeting for the first time in July of next year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para7"></a>I have given some serious consideration to whether or not we should have a bicameral system in Scotland. I do not wish to be dogmatic. I am not imposing my views on anyone; indeed, I am just expressing my views and they may well be rejected and described as nonsense. Nevertheless, that has never stopped me expressing my views in the past and I do not propose to cease doing so today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para8"></a>I believe that we should have an extensive debate on the matter. I do not like the idea contained in one of the noble Lord's amendments; namely, that we should have a commission. The first job of any appointed commission is to look for the next job. I have never really been in favour of such commissions being appointed. After all, we are all mature enough as politicians to decide the issue over the years ahead.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para9"></a>I have looked at the situation which has developed in Scotland, particularly over the past 8 months since the referendum. I say openly and publicly that one of the great mistakes that my party made in Scotland was sharing a joint platform with the Scottish National Party. When the BBC asked me whether I would share a platform on a television programme with the SNP people, I made it absolutely clear that they had played no part in the convention and that I would not share a platform with them. All we did as a party during the referendum was to throw a lifeline to a party that was dying on its feet. It did not have a good result in the general election in Scotland on 1st May 1997; indeed, it achieved 22 per cent. of the vote while in actual fact it was looking for something like 30 per cent. or 34 per cent. But we revived that party by agreeing to share platforms. Today we see the net result of shared platforms.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para10"></a>I have seen all the opinion polls in the past. I was telling some of my colleagues that, 12 weeks before the 1979 general election, one of Scotland's national newspapers, which I will not name to save it embarrassment, published an opinion poll. It then got the professor of politics at Strathclyde University to extrapolate the poll and then published a front-page headline stating that the SNP was going to win 44 seats at the forthcoming general election. However, if the late Donald Stewart, a much respected Scottish National Party Member for the Western Isles, had not held on to his seat at that time, the SNP would have been completely wiped out in Scotland. The party lost 10 of the 11 seats that it had held just 12 weeks after that opinion poll was published.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para11"></a>So I am not taken in by opinion polls. Nevertheless, I am worried about the unity of the United Kingdom. That leads me to leave with your Lordships my thoughts on a second chamber and how it should be comprised. It is my view that one of our duties is to ensure that a Scottish parliament is viewed in the way we have always intended; namely, as devolved, not independent or separate. The way to ensure that we present it as devolved is to link it inextricably with Westminster, on the one hand, and with Europe on the other.
<P>


<a name="column_1250"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1250</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para12"></a>Therefore, it is my view that a second chamber should be comprised of the elected Scottish Members of Parliament in the other House, and the eight elected Scottish Members of the European Parliament. Those Members would cost nothing. People worry about the costs involved, but they are already being paid. Those Members would comprise the second chamber. In that process we would link Edinburgh, Westminster and Europe all together. That process would also have another effect. People ask me for the answer to the West Lothian question: "Why can I vote for education in Blackburn, Lancashire, as a Scottish MP, but I cannot vote for education in Blackburn, West Lothian?". They would be able to vote on education in Blackburn, West Lothian, and that would also answer the West Lothian question.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para13"></a>I do not believe that we will decide the issue today--at least, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, will not push the matter to a vote. The noble Lord has done Scotland in particular, and the United Kingdom in general, a service by initiating this debate. It is a debate that we can take forward in a constructive fashion. That is why it is important that we do not take such decisions today; indeed, we must not lock ourselves in and compartmentalise ourselves. We must continue the discussion that has been rightly started by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, as month follows month, and possibly in two or three years' time we will return to the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para14"></a>If we are to preserve the unity of the United Kingdom--and for me that is paramount--the last thing I want to see is an independent Scotland. The last thing I want to see is separation. Nationalism is the most dangerous force in politics. I shall never forget the late Willy Brandt. While I was with the Council of Europe, he came to a Commission meeting and used the phrase that the "graveyards of Europe were littered with the victims of nationalism". We need nationalism like a hole in the head. If we need institutions that prevent us wandering into that kind of situation, we should be prepared to discuss them openly. For that reason, I am grateful that this amendment has been tabled and discussed. However, I plead with the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, not to push the matter to a vote today. This is neither the day nor the time to make a decision on such a vitally important issue.

He thinks about these matters a lot, as indeed does the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon. I hope that the Government are listening. These are not all-party political issues, as the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, will discover during his time in this House. I am sure that he will make an excellent contribution to our future debates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para15"></a>Those of us who have been here a long time know that legislation has to be tested. The policy within it has to be tested and so does the wording. It needs to be tested more than once. We have been doing this for <P>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1251</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>years. We know what would have happened to our legislation in this country if we had not been here. We can feel that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para16"></a>Civil servants and Ministers are not always right. Scotland, and Edinburgh in particular, are small places. Everyone knows everyone. The civil servants all know each other. They will know the members of the Scottish parliament and the members of the Scottish parliament will know them. Everyone will know the Ministers well. For all its new arrangements, can we be sure that this parliament will be able to stand up to its administration? Will the administration be able to stand up to its civil servants? I do not think for a moment that my noble friend, in moving this amendment, was trying to delay the establishment of the Scottish parliament. That, with respect, is a rather despicable suggestion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para17"></a>It is reasonable to have this debate. It has been a good debate. I expect it is nearly over. Other great affairs of state are about to be discussed in this Chamber and we do not wish to delay them. I hope that the Government will think of some way out of this problem. The idea of the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, may be a good one. I was attracted to it when I first heard it. I believe it could have a good secondary effect as well as a good primary effect by linking the parliament to the constitution in a way that is acceptable to the people of Scotland. I believe that would be acceptable. We may need a specially created body. A reformed House of Lords may contain a structure which could meet in Scotland to do that job. There are a number of ways it could be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-06_para18"></a>I believe that over the summer--if not before--the Government should think hard about this matter. The fact that this suggestion has not been made previously is surely because it has not been considered by this Chamber. We are the people who know about scrutinising legislation. Other people do not worry about it. They do not necessarily know what goes on here. I hope that the Government will think about this matter. I hope that my noble friend will take the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, at this stage and withdraw the amendment to enable the Government to consider it.

<A NAME="80708-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   I seek a little clarification following what the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, has said. I refer to the Scottish Constitutional Convention. Did the Conservatives, particularly the Conservative Peers, and, more particularly, the independent Peers, ever have a chance to take part in the Scottish Constitutional Convention? I am certainly not aware that the independent Peers did. Could that be clarified?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, will allow me to answer the question. The question is easily answered. Every person in Scotland was invited to attend the original meeting that set up the Scottish Constitutional Convention. All our meetings were held in public. People joined us as we went along, whether they were Conservative, SNP, Labour, non-political, members of Churches, trade unions, the <P>

<P>
<A NAME="80708-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, generously suggested that this matter merits a full discussion. I wonder therefore if I may presume to extend it a little. The noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, wisely asked the Government to consider carefully what we are putting forward in view of his 35 years' experience in Parliament. Dare I say I have had 53 years' experience in Parliament, most of that involved with legislation in one way or another?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para0"></a>The first point that I feel it is necessary for us to get right is the following. To what extent should we rely upon the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which was an advisory body? Parliament receives advice from various bodies such as Royal Commissions, specially appointed departmental committees and outside bodies of various kinds. We do not accept that advice more than about 50 per cent. of the time. We have to decide these matters within our own responsibility. We cannot delegate that responsibility merely by saying, "Someone else has decided this. They may be right so we ought to accept that". That is not the spirit in which we legislate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para1"></a>I warmly support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. I suggest that to have a second chamber would add to the value and importance of a Scottish legislature. I say that for the simple reason that in this long-established Westminster Parliament goodness knows how things would have gone without the revising powers of your Lordships' House. In Scotland we have to remember that they will start off with various disadvantages compared with the position that we have. In the first place--dare I say it?--most of the members of the new Scottish parliament in what is to be called the lower chamber (if we are to have a second chamber) will have had little, if any, parliamentary experience. Some will. Some of my noble friends will stand for that parliament and their contributions will be valuable. But we have to remember that to a great extent it will be a body of people who are tiros, inexperienced in parliamentary matters. How will they be advised on legislation? Of course the Scottish parliamentary draftsmen at present have a great reputation. I dare to say that often Scottish legislation compares favourably with that governing the United Kingdom as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para2"></a>However, the Scottish draftsmen will have to continue to advise the Scottish Office when legislation which affects Scotland passes through our Parliament at Westminster. There will be quite a lot of that. The Scottish parliamentary draftsmen are not over-manned at the moment. New draftsmen will have to be found and trained. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate is the Minister responsible for that. It <P>


<a name="column_1253"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1253</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be interesting to hear in due course--I do not say necessarily on this amendment--whether he can give us some idea of the number of parliamentary draftsmen who will be needed for a new Scottish parliament. That would be very helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para3"></a>With those limitations and difficulties, surely it would be wise to have a revising chamber. There is just one further point. One of my noble friends said there would be no delay. I am afraid that there will necessarily be some delay in order to ask the body to be appointed by the Prime Minister of the day--after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition--to consider, under these amendments, the composition of a second chamber. It is right that great care should be taken over the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, was right in saying that this is not a matter that we should rush into. We should consider it very carefully. We should make provisions in the Bill of the kind proposed by my noble friend Lord Mackay, which ensure that it is done carefully. I hope the Government will give the matter serious consideration. We shall be making history for Scotland with this Bill. We have to make it the best legislation that we can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hughes: </B>   I must apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. An outside commitment overran, so I did not hear his speech. I shall read it tomorrow.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para5"></a>At Second Reading, I expressed the opinion that a revising chamber was a desirable thing. That is not surprising. My long membership in Parliament has been entirely in this House. So I have seen the merits of a revising chamber--provided that it confines itself to being a revising chamber. The noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, made a slight mistake in attributing the Norway suggestion to my noble friend Lady Ramsay of Cartvale. I made that suggestion during my Second Reading speech. I believe I am correct in saying that she gave it not unfavourable consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para6"></a>No matter how much a Bill may be discussed in one House, it nearly always seems to need amendment. The Bill before us today is no exception. I have looked at it roughly, and find that at least 25 amendments have been tabled in the name of my noble friend Lord Sewel, and not all are merely drafting amendments. Some are quite serious, particularly those in relation to reserve powers. So we have a demonstration in relation to the very Bill that we are discussing of the merits of having a different group of people to examine the legislation. The Norway example is one possibility. However, that would be a matter for the Scottish parliament to decide.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para7"></a>We have limited experience here at Westminster of single-chamber government. We had it for a short period under Oliver Cromwell, who abolished the House of Lords. However, before very long he decided he had made a mistake and set it up again.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para8"></a>I cannot support the amendment, although I believe that in the long run the government in Scotland would be better if it, too, had a revising chamber. But that must be a matter for the Scottish parliament. In this country we do not know how a single-chamber parliament would work in modern times. We must accept that there are <P>


<a name="column_1254"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1254</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many countries in the world, including the English-speaking world, where a single chamber seems to work effectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para9"></a>I therefore suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, should accept the provision, if it is certain that it would be within the powers of the Scottish parliament to divide itself into two or to recommend a separate elected chamber. However, I am certain that it would not wish to have a second chamber that was other than a revising chamber and with no rights to insist against the will of the other house.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para10"></a>The real merit of this place is that we can examine legislation and do not always arrive at the same political conclusions as Members of another place. Four of my noble friends have spoken on the Bill; three have given support to a revising chamber in one form or another. I would not go so far as my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon in inviting the Government to consider accepting the amendment. However, one of my colleagues was wholehearted in his opposition. He rather over-egged the pudding. He said that the people of Scotland had voted emphatically against a second chamber. I doubt if there was one in 10,000 people who voted for a Scottish parliament who had any idea as to whether it should have one or two chambers. What people wanted was not separation, but a parliament to look after their rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para11"></a>I suggest that it would be wise to leave this matter to the body which will meet for the first time, as my noble friend suggested. Let us leave it to the parliament to decide whether the one chamber is working as well as it would like, or whether it would prefer something else. I am certain that its members would not want to rush into any change. They would want to approach the matter with due consideration. The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, suggested long consideration. I suggest that on this particular matter the right place for that long consideration is Edinburgh.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   I strongly support the noble Lord, Lord Ewing. He has apparently come up with a suggestion which, apart from anything else, gets round the West Lothian question. However, we must also pay attention to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Gordon. He is involved with the media and therefore keeps in close contact with what the Scottish people are saying. I have to disagree with my noble friends Lord Lang and Lady Carnegy of Lour. This House would be totally inappropriate as a second chamber for the Scottish parliament. The Scottish people have voted unanimously for a parliament and laws in Scotland, not in England. That is the reason the parliament is being set up in the first place. Therefore, it is my strong belief that they are wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para12"></a>I venture to say, perhaps rather facetiously, that one of the reasons why a second chamber has not been discussed until this moment is that the other place does not understand what this House does. It is not until Members from the other end of the building come through to this end that they understand the importance of a revising chamber and the process of the law that we conduct in this place.

<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para13"></a>I hope that there will be a second chamber in Scotland. It is very important that that happens. However, we must not stop the movement towards the implementation of the parliament. Its success is paramount if we are to have a continued United Kingdom. Any delay will be seen as procrastination on our part and will go against everything that we are trying to do to keep the country united.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-07_para14"></a>I therefore strongly recommend this as the right idea, but we should write into the Bill a provision whereby the parliament itself has to form a second chamber--by the means suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay of Cartvale, or by any other means that we come up with. But we must consider this issue. It would be a great mistake to allow the Scottish parliament to be set up without any sort of revising chamber being a possibility.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, he might agree with me that the suggestion by the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, answers only half of the West Lothian question. If I remember correctly, the Member of Parliament for Blackburn in Lothian can vote on a matter that affects Blackburn in Lancashire, but cannot vote on a matter possibly affecting schools in Blackburn, Lothian. That will be the situation. Given the noble Lord's suggestion of constituting a second chamber from Members in the other place, that wrong would be corrected. However, if the Member of Parliament for Blackburn in Lancashire cannot vote on a matter affecting a school in Blackburn in Lothian although the Member of Parliament for West Lothian can, that part of the question is not answered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   I very much sympathise with the idea that the question of a second chamber has to be discussed, and will be discussed. The noble Lord, Lord Hughes, mentioned the suggestion that the Scottish parliament could make itself into two different sections, one to be a revising body.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para0"></a>What is proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, in particular in Amendment No. 7, need not delay the formation of a Scottish parliament if we decouple that and say that within five years the Prime Minister will appoint a commission to examine the question of a second Chamber for the Scottish parliament. Constitutional reforms have previously been passed by the Westminster Parliament for countries which became independent. I could give examples, but I shall not do so. It would be easy to say that the Scottish parliament should start on time and should have five or 10 years in which to deliberate, within which time it might itself, as the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, suggested, citing the example of the Czech Republic, decide to have a second Chamber. Perhaps the Prime Minister of the day could appoint a commission to consider the question of a second Chamber for the Scottish parliament. That commission might arrive at a decision yea or nay, but we can leave that for a later day and return to this question when we have had experience of the Scottish parliament as a unicameral Chamber. It need not all be done at once.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   It is clear that we have had a well-measured and constructive debate on this important amendment. It is right that we should take time to explore the arguments on both sides of the case. I have to say though that today is not the best of days to try to persuade me of the value of a second Chamber!
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para1"></a>The debate concerns two, often closely related, concepts, those of function and structure. I do not believe that anything divides us on function. There is complete agreement on the need to have a parliamentary structure in which there is proper and robust scrutiny of legislation. The difference between us is on the appropriate and best structure to fulfil that function.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para2"></a>I do not believe, and the Government do not believe, that it is necessary to have a separate second Chamber, following the Westminster model of your Lordships' House, in order to achieve the appropriate and necessary degree of scrutiny. I believe it is valuable to try to move away from the Westminster mind-set and to recognise that there are other ways of organising a legislature.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para3"></a>During the 20 years or so when we were debating this issue in Scotland, there was a growing awareness that it was not appropriate to follow slavishly the procedures and processes that exist in this Parliament. The opportunity arose to try to come up with different types of solutions to what were seen as common and shared problems. That is what happened during the process of the Constitutional Convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para4"></a>I appreciate that noble Lords opposite were not part of the Constitutional Convention, and I make no comment about that. Their party thought it was inappropriate to be part of that process. I think it would have been enormously valuable if they had shared in that, but they did not, and that was their choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para5"></a>Through the Constitutional Convention, which was widely based, the issue of scrutiny was addressed in great detail, as my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford indicated and the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, described. On page 24 of its report, Scotland's Parliament, Scotland's Right, it is made absolutely clear that in the convention's view a second Chamber is not necessary in order to provide for proper parliamentary scrutiny. The Government have built upon that consensus. I see nothing wrong in a government building upon consensus, especially consensus that has been built up over time and has been the product of debate, probing and scrutiny.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para6"></a>It was that thinking that lay behind the detailed recommendations that the Government put to the people of Scotland in the White Paper at the time of the referendum. I believe that the people of Scotland are aware--indeed, more than aware--of the basic shape of the proposals that were put to them in the White Paper at that time. It was clear that the Scottish parliament was to be a unicameral parliament and was not to have a second Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para7"></a>My noble friend Lord Howie of Troon invited me to hearken to and heed the siren voices in favour of a second Chamber. I say to my noble friend that I have <P>


<a name="column_1257"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1257</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>greater confidence in listening to the voices, and indeed the votes, of the Scottish people in the referendum which gave their decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para8"></a>Throughout my involvement and engagement with the devolution issue in Scotland, I have not been aware of any sustained support for the idea of a second Chamber. Over the 20 years or so, the idea has come up from time to time but has quickly disappeared. It is not a concept that enjoys support in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para9"></a>I disagree with my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford. I do not think that institutions should be established in order to prevent certain political objectives from being achieved. Like my noble friend, I am totally opposed to the idea of nationalism as a political creed and to separation as a policy objective. But I do not think that it is right somehow to construct the institutions of the parliament to prevent that. Again, I am prepared to put my faith and my confidence in the people of Scotland. At the end of the day, I have to acknowledge that, if the people of Scotland, through whatever process is decided appropriate, opt for independence or separation, then that is their right and I have to accept it, although I disagree with it. We do not get anywhere by trying to construct institutions that will be seen as artificially thwarting it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para10"></a>I now turn to the details of the amendments. The amendments are in fact devoid of detail, which is important. They refer to the setting up of a commission but are silent on the issues of the powers of the second Chamber and its composition and membership. It took us 20 years to reach a broadly agreed position on the powers and composition contained in the present proposals. I wonder how long it would take such a commission to reach agreement on the powers and composition of a second Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para11"></a>I take the point made by my noble friend Lord Gordon that support for this amendment runs the risk--I put it no stronger than that--of being interpreted in Scotland as a means of delaying the implementation of the Scottish parliament. That is something that those who wish to support the amendment will have to take into account when they make their decision. We made clear in the White Paper and subsequently that there is a timetable; that a clock is running. We said that the elections would take place in the first half of 1999. We said that the parliament would be up and running by the year 2000. We now intend to bring that date forward on the basis of agreement among the various political parties. The passing of this amendment as it stands would clearly delay the implementation of the Scottish parliament. I believe that the people of Scotland would find that difficult to understand.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para12"></a>We have had a number of important contributions based on the legislative process--how we can improve and have the most appropriate form of legislation; how it should proceed through parliament. I make one comment on that. I will trust the parliament. Let the parliament decide the processes it wishes to adopt. I believe that we will have a grown-up, mature parliament for a grown-up, mature country. Let us recognise that it is the right of that parliament to decide its own processes and proceedings.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para13"></a>Throughout the whole of the debate on the role and function of the Scottish parliament there was the greatest determination in every group of which I was a member--I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and my noble friend Lord Ewing will agree--to ensure that the parliament adopted procedures which delivered robust scrutiny in the most effective way possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para14"></a>The proposals before the Committee have not come out of the ether overnight. They have been developed on the basis of negotiation, discussion and consensus-building over several years. It would be difficult for the people of Scotland to understand the major change in the structure of the parliament which these amendments involve, and much more so a delay in the introduction of the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para15"></a>Let me deal with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, in relation to other countries. As the noble Lord said, the Nordic countries--Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden and Finland, which we all accept are mature, effective, functioning democracies--have unicameral democracies. We do not cite them in any way to argue that we should slavishly follow them. We say that it shows that there can be mature and effective democracies, mature and effective parliaments that are unicameral. If it works in that context, in the context of the vast majority of the Germany Lander and in the context of New Zealand, why should it not work in the context of Scotland?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para16"></a>I make one further reference. The structure for the future government of Northern Ireland enjoys widespread support in this Chamber and between the parties generally. The legislative assembly that is to be established in Northern Ireland is a unicameral parliament and I have heard no argument against that during the whole of the discussions on the future structure of the government of Northern Ireland. Therefore, we have seen already that there is acceptance that in the United Kingdom unicameral legislation is compatible with the way in which we have arranged our political affairs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para17"></a>There are many ways in which the Scottish parliament will be able to adapt its internal structures and procedures to ensure that there is proper and appropriate scrutiny of the legislation and of the executive itself. We have had an exceedingly good debate on the issue and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who took part in this debate and to the Minister for his reply. When I read Hansard, his words in relation to a "mature parliament" will come back and no doubt will be used to haunt him as we go through the Bill. For example, we may well throw his words back at him when we come to Clause 33, among others. However, we will leave that matter until later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para18"></a>The noble Lord made much of the fact that there was no sustained support in Scotland for a second chamber. I do not believe that there is much sustained opposition either. The noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, who seems to have had the notes to defend the Minister on this issue, said that the Scottish people decided not to have a <P>


<a name="column_1259"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1259</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>second chamber. I was not aware that they had ever been asked, which was a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hughes. I do not believe they were ever asked. The ballot paper I had contained two questions and a second chamber did not figure in either of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-08_para19"></a>We should not allow the Government to hide behind the defence that the question was not asked; therefore it was not answered; and therefore we should not debate it. Nor do I want to hear an argument from the Government, every time we come to a serious amendment, that somehow or other we are attempting to delay the passage of the Bill. I accept that there is a clock ticking towards the end date. I made it perfectly clear that we accept the result of the referendum and the Government's right to take this Bill through Parliament, to implement it and to have the election and the setting up of the parliament on the date they fix. But I hope that every time we come to an amendment we do not hear that we are simply trying to find ways of delaying the passage of the Bill. If the clock is ticking a bit late in the day, it is because it is taking the Government rather a long time to get the Bill into the Committee stage of your Lordships' Chamber. That is not my doing.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not accusing Members opposite of seeking to delay the Bill. I am saying that, if the amendment was passed, it would inevitably delay the implementation and coming into force of the Scottish parliament. That is a different matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I accept the distinction, but I believe there was a suggestion in relation to the "ticking clock" that the amendments and discussion on them would inevitably delay the Bill. I accept that the last amendment in the group would have that effect, though I did not intend that. Frankly, as this is very much a probing and opening up of the debate, it would not take more than a few minutes to re-phrase the amendments in order to allow the Scottish parliament to start but to make provision for a second chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para0"></a>The Government should listen to what is being said, not just from this side of the Chamber but also from their own Benches. The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, intervened to tell us how I have changed my mind. He keeps saying that. But he went on to say that there was great virtue in changing one's mind. It shows that one has enough brains to have second thoughts. The noble Lord said that he felt this was an important issue and should be discussed and decided, not necessarily before the Scottish parliament is up and running but through some provision allowing it to be discussed in the initial years. That was a view supported by the noble Lord, Lord Desai.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para1"></a>There is a broadly based body of opinion therefore that believes that a second chamber is worth a great deal more consideration than it has been given to date. I fully accept, as the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, said, that the powers of that second chamber would have to be considered. Indeed, my amendment refers to the powers and composition of a second chamber. I fully accept that in America the Senate has moved from being a revising chamber to being arguably the driving chamber, the most powerful <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>chamber. That is something I would not recommend, nor do I recommend it for any reform of this Chamber. These are difficult matters. The fact that the Government have not come forward with proper proposals for the reform of your Lordships' Chamber tells us that these matters are not easy to resolve: nor are they in the Scottish context.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para2"></a>I welcome the views from around the Chamber, with one or two exceptions, that there is merit in considering the proposition that we ought to have a second chamber in order to deal with Scottish legislation and the Scottish parliamentary situation. I am not of the view, as are some people--the noble Lord, Lord Steel, hopes for this--that it will all be sweetness and light. My noble friend Lord Lang said that he felt it might be more, not less, acrimonious. Certainly, if Scottish politics at the moment are anything to go by, it is pretty rough. Unfortunately, I have to say that my party and indeed the party of the noble Lord, Lord Steel, are slightly on the sidelines of the roughness, but there is a fair degree of roughness between the governing party and the Scottish National Party. However, we shall have more of that later. I am aware that many of your Lordships wish to get on to the important defence Statement.

<A NAME = "80708-09_para3"></a>We have had an excellent debate. We have expressed to the Government from all sides that there is merit in considering the case for a second chamber. I simply say this to the Government. Given the timetable, I accept that it would probably be almost impossible to devise a second chamber solution which would be up and running before 1st May. But we all ought to reflect on how we could incorporate in the Bill a provision for a second chamber to be considered by the Scottish parliament and by this Parliament thereafter so that in two or three years' time we would be able, if we wished, to put in place a second chamber. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Gilbert): </B>  My Lords, with permission, I shall repeat a Statement that has recently been made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80708-09_para7"></a>"With permission, Madam Speaker, I should like to make a statement concerning the outcome of the Strategic Defence Review. I am today publishing a White Paper [Cm 3999] setting out the conclusions of the review, and a volume of detailed supporting essays. Copies are available in the Vote Office and I have written to all honourable Members individually, enclosing copies as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para8"></a>"However, before I address that issue may I first of all apologise to you and to the House for the unauthorised and improper disclosure to some newspapers last night of the content of the White Paper. I am as angry and as outraged at this leak as any other Member of this House. I have asked the Cabinet Secretary to authorise an immediate and thorough investigation into how this came about. The person or persons responsible will be dealt with severely.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para9"></a>"This is a serious breach of an embargo designed to make sure that the detail of this major review was given first of all to the House of Commons. I regret very much that the House and the Ministry of Defence's own employees heard first from the media. I take full responsibility for this situation, as my office demands, and that is why I apologise to you and to my parliamentary colleagues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para10"></a>"Madam Speaker, the British people are rightly proud of their Armed Forces. They want, indeed expect, the Government to provide strong defence for their country. The Strategic Defence Review does just that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para11"></a>"This review is the most radical and far-reaching reshaping and modernisation of our forces for a generation--unique in three key ways. First, it has been foreign policy-led, not Treasury driven; secondly, it has been unprecedentedly open and inclusive; and, thirdly, it has the wholehearted support of all of the service chiefs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para12"></a>"This review will fundamentally reshape and modernise Britain's Armed Forces, sorting the weaknesses, building on our strengths and providing a structure to deal with tomorrow's threats, not yesterday's enemies. As a result, our forces will be more mobile, better manned, better supported and equipped, and better able to act as a force for good in the world--where we can and when we choose.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para13"></a>"The world has changed out of all recognition since the end of the Cold War. NATO remains the basis for defence and security. But while the threat of major war in Europe is now a remote prospect, new threats confront us--terrorism, the international drugs trade, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1262"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1262</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>weapons, information warfare, ethnic rivalries, population pressures and the break-up of existing states.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para14"></a>"In the Cold War, we needed large forces at home and on the Continent to defend against the constant threat of massive attack from the Soviet Union. Now, instability is the new enemy and the need is increasingly to help prevent or shape crises further away--if necessary, by deploying military forces rapidly before they get out of hand. In other words, we must now be prepared to go to the crisis, rather than have the crisis come to us.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para15"></a>"Yet this review has demonstrated that our forces are not properly adapted to this new environment. In today's world we need to get our troops to trouble spots and crisis areas quickly and safely and make sure they are properly supported when they get there. The review, however, has highlighted the serious weaknesses we have inherited in this area--most notably in heavy transport and in our hollowed out and demoralised defence medical services.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para16"></a>"At the same time, increased commitments since then have taken their toll on morale, recruitment and retention and worsened the already very serious problem of undermanning in our forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para17"></a>"The review therefore proposes major new investment and new enhancements to improve the ability of our troops to deploy more rapidly to trouble spots around the world. We will acquire four additional roll-on roll-off container ships and four large C-17 aircraft or their equivalent. To support and supply our troops once they reach these trouble spots, we will enhance the Army's supporting arms so that for the first time they can undertake two operations at the same time. And because we have a solemn duty of care to our servicemen and women whom we ask to put their lives at risk, it will make new money and personnel available to revitalise the defence medical services.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para18"></a>"In total, I am proposing an increase in the size of the regular Army of 3,300, a change which will go a long way to restoring vital parts of our Armed Forces which have been hollowed out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para19"></a>"Another key theme of the review has been a more integrated or joint service approach to defence to improve the operational effectiveness of the forces. We are therefore introducing a series of radical changes to our Armed Forces. These include bringing together all our battlefield helicopters under a single command and expanding the responsibilities of the Chief of Joint Operations; a new Joint Defence Centre to develop doctrine and other planning on a tri-service basis; and a four-star Chief of Defence Logistics who will co-ordinate and standardise our three support services properly for the first time. I am today pleased to announce that the first such chief will be Lieutenant General Sir Sam Cowan, currently the Quartermaster General.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para20"></a>"I am also responding to an historic proposal by the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Air Staff by developing a new Joint Force 2000 which will bring <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1263"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1263</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>together Royal Navy and RAF Harrier jets into a single organisation able to operate equally effectively from aircraft carriers or land bases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para21"></a>"But the most important of these joint initiatives is the creation of a new pool of joint rapid reaction forces. These will be the spearhead of our new modernised front line and will include all of our high readiness forces. Not only will they enable us to respond quickly and effectively to crises of all kinds, and to build up larger forces should that be necessary, but--unlike today--we will be able to mount more than one Bosnia-size operation at a time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para22"></a>"The review also introduces important new front-line capabilities. We will create a sixth deployable brigade to increase the Army's flexibility and help tackle overstretch. The parachute role of the current airborne brigade will also be transferred to the airmobile brigade, which will become a new, powerful and highly mobile air-manoeuvre brigade or "air cavalry" when the Apache attack helicopter enters service.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para23"></a>"And to meet our longer term needs, I am delighted to be able to tell the House that we plan to replace our current small carriers from around 2012 with two larger, more versatile, carriers--in effect, floating airfields capable of carrying a more powerful force, including a future carrier-borne aircraft to replace the Harrier the cost of which will be spread over some 20 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para24"></a>"I can also tell the House that the review confirms that the acquisition of 232 Eurofighters remains central to our long-term plans, providing a step change in the RAF's combat ability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para25"></a>"But changes in the nature and scale of operations mean that we need two fewer submarines, three fewer destroyers and frigates and 36 fewer combat aircraft.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para26"></a>"These changes, though, will not lead to cuts in the overall strength of our regular forces since the manpower released by these reductions will be used to fill gaps in front line manning, thereby easing overstretch.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para27"></a>"For our reserves, there will also be important enhancements to the Royal Navy Reserve and the Reserve Air Forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para28"></a>"I am determined that the Territorial Army should become more relevant, usable and integrated with the rest of our forces. Those who wish to see it languish in an outdated Cold War role do the TA no service at all. Although its numbers will be trimmed to 40,000, it will be given a real heavyweight role in our nation's defences and called up more frequently in times of crisis. And for that we intend also that they be better trained and properly equipped.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para29"></a>"Unlike other recent reviews, this review is designed to put people first. That is why I am today announcing a significant new training and education initiative to boost recruitment and retention. All recruits will be given the opportunity to gain the six key skills needed by all in the workplace, and all personnel will be given the chance to achieve qualifications recognised by civilian employers.
<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1264"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1264</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para30"></a>"In addition, there will be a major new programme, the learning forces' initiative, to expand education and training opportunities for the Armed Forces through new 'learning credits', which may be claimed both during service careers and for sometime afterwards.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para31"></a>"These proposals will boost recruitment and retention by increasing the already considerable benefits of a service career and benefit defence by developing the skills needed for modern warfare. The economy as a whole will also benefit as better qualified personnel return to the civilian employment market after their service career.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para32"></a>"For our service families, we are setting up a task force to address the special problems which arise from their mobile lifestyle. And for Britain's ex-servicemen and women, we are setting up a new veterans' cell to provide an access point for guidance and advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para33"></a>"It is of course vital that our Armed Forces are properly resourced. But if defence is to command the support of the nation it must also be seen as good value for money. By 2001-2, in three years' time, we will be spending &#163;747 million more than this year. In real terms, allowing for one-off asset sales, this will be a reduction of &#163;685 million or about 3 per cent. in the defence budget. That compares with a reduction of over 20 per cent. in real terms in the last seven years of the previous government. We will do this primarily through increased efficiency, smarter procurement and better utilisation of assets. And because the review represents a three-year settlement, we will be able to bring a new stability to our defence planning.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para34"></a>"This Government believe that, in addition to caring for our people and defending our rights at home, we must also discharge our responsibilities in the world. We must therefore strengthen the effectiveness of the international community in peace support and humanitarian operations of all kinds, particularly through the United Nations. I can therefore announce that Britain will now make a larger proportion of our front line capabilities potentially available to the UN for peace support and humanitarian deployments, including all of our rapidly deployable forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para35"></a>"In what is still an uncertain and unstable world, we must, of course, be able to react quickly to crises as they develop. But we should aim to do more than that. We should aim to prevent conflict from arising in the first place. I therefore intend to elevate conflict prevention--or 'defence diplomacy' as I have called it--to one of the eight core missions which will underpin our defence planning. That commitment will be backed up by a series of practical measures, including new education and training initiatives, to help develop and promote modern, democratically accountable forces around the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para36"></a>"I would like to turn now, if I may, to the review's conclusions on our nuclear deterrent. This Government were elected on a promise that we would retain Trident. We have kept and will continue to <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1265"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1265</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>keep that promise. All of us wish to see a safer world in which there is no place for nuclear weapons. But while large nuclear arsenals and risks of proliferation remain, our minimum deterrent remains a necessary and continuing element of our security. We have, though, conducted a rigorous re-examination of our present deterrence requirements. We have concluded that we can safely make further significant reductions form Cold War levels.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para37"></a>"We will, therefore, retain Trident as our sole nuclear system, but the single submarine on patrol at any one time will carry only 48 warheads. This compares with the previous government's announced ceiling of 96. And by reducing our overall stockpile to 200 operationally available warheads, we will have cut the explosive power of the deterrent by 70 per cent. since the end of the Cold War. At the same time we will press ahead with arms control and introduce much greater openness on nuclear issues, including on our stocks of fissile material. All in all, these are sensible measures which I am sure will be widely welcomed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para38"></a>"This is a truly radical review which builds on the strengths and successes of our forces. It rectifies the weaknesses we inherited and it modernises our forces to deal with tomorrow's threats rather than yesterday's enemies. It places the skilled, brave and versatile people on whom our defence depends firmly at the centre of our planning and it gives them a clear sense of direction into the next century. Above all, it delivers the modern forces Britain needs for the modern world. This is a good deal for defence and a good deal for the country. I commend it to the House."
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para39"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made by his right honourable friend in another place. At the same time I thank him for giving me a copy of the White Paper and of the Statement itself. I must emphasise that my brown envelope was a legitimate one. However, when I said in the defence debate last December that the then forthcoming review was not leaking, I had no conception of the degree to which it would leak thereafter, culminating in what we have seen in today's papers. It really is not acceptable that Peers and MPs in another place should read the Strategic Defence Review in the Daily Telegraph before it is put before Members of both Houses. The remarks with which the Secretary of State's Statement begins are very welcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para40"></a>It is essential that this House has a full opportunity of debating the White Paper. I am well aware of the pressure of government business, but it is essential that this House should have at least a full day's debate as soon as possible. It should be before the House rises at the end of this month, or whenever that may be. If this proves impossible--and I do not see why it should be--we must have time in the spill-over period. It is likely that there will be a Scotland Bill-like number of noble Lords wanting to speak and we really need two days for it.
<P>


<a name="column_1266"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1266</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para41"></a>We have been told that the review has been foreign-policy based, but there can be no doubt that the dead hand of the Treasury has been on it. The Government have never published the foreign policy baseline which would have led them to try to match capabilities to commitments. The White Paper certainly does not do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para42"></a>I suppose we should be grateful to the Secretary of State and his advisers that the cuts, amounting to &#163;915 million, have been kept down to that figure. I suppose that is the figure but the White Paper is remarkably light on finance (and incidentally on timing). But however the figures are presented and however the leaks are spin-doctored, there can be no doubt that as a result of this Strategic Defence Review Britain's forces will have fewer men, (in spite of the Regular Army increases), fewer ships and less money.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para43"></a>All the leaks have told us that the review will be foreign-policy led, but the document contains no foreign policy baseline. It says that we cannot predict the crises we will face. While this is self-evident, little has been done about it and the broad benchmarks referred to in the White Paper are very broad indeed. The saving statement is that we must retain the ability to build a bigger force. If that is in the plan, it is well hidden.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para44"></a>The result of this has been to leave plans for the future in an indeterminate state. An indication of this lies in the references to the two new large aircraft carriers which, with Eurofighter, can probably be considered to be the kingplanks of the review. Each time the aircraft carriers are referred to the document says, "we plan to" and this phrase was repeated in the Secretary of State's statement this afternoon. Never does it say, "We will build the aircraft carriers", and the cynics will claim there is too much of a let out if the Chancellor suddenly had a victory and in the light of a changing economic situation, or for any other reason, demanded a major saving.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para45"></a>Because of the leaks, which we have all heard, the contents of the review are well known. This is not the time to go over them in detail, but certain points should be touched on in advance of a full-scale debate in this House. First and most importantly, the timetable seems to be remarkably vague. The Statement seems impeccable but nowhere, with the sole exception of the gloomy figure of 2012 for the completion of the aircraft carriers, is there anything resembling a timetable. There are, as the Statement says, many radical proposals. The costs will very greatly depend on the recruitment of army personnel; the TA cuts; disposal of assets; payments for jointery and a number of other factors. Done quickly they will probably be more expensive but more efficient; done slowly, costs will probably be lower but there will be many other disadvantages.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para46"></a>The discussion of details of the review must await the debate, but there are one or two matters on which I must touch. The Territorial Army is one. Morale is low because of the uncertainty and there is still no indication, even in the White Paper, from where the 19,000 manpower saving is to come. Which units are affected? Which TA centres are to be closed? The Duke of York Barracks have been mentioned. That is an <P>


<a name="column_1267"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1267</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>obvious target because of the great value of the land on which the barracks stand, but has full consideration been given to the fact that that will tear the heart out of the TA in London? The TA infantry battalions are a genuine general reserve. The review acknowledges there could be a crisis where existing regular forces are not adequate. Has it acknowledged the fact that replacements will be harder to get hold of?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para47"></a>Three armoured regiments are to be brought back from Germany. But where are they to be trained, particularly in the light of the fact that it may be more difficult in future to do this in Scotland or Wales? Can the department successfully deal with the troublesome environmentalists who do not like bangs and force units to carry a Portaloo rather than dig a hole in the ground?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para48"></a>The review and the Statement seem to skate carefully--a difficult task for a Labour Government--with regard to the difficult nuclear issue. The Secretary of State is to be very much congratulated on what is said in the Statement on that. I hope that the Minister will underline the point made that nuclear disarmament would greatly increase the costs of a conventional non-nuclear defence programme.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para49"></a>Recruitment, retention and education are rightly singled out. Retention is particularly important as trained men are at present dropping out of the back as fast as untrained men come in the front. If airlines are having to be bribed not to take on RAF pilots, we are in a desperate position and the ministry is right to do everything it can to keep service personnel and their families happy. The intentions, as set out in the review, are estimable. Let us hope they will be backed up by a fact or two.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para50"></a>Rightly in his Statement the Secretary of State talks about overstretch and undermanning. The plans for welfare and education are designed to help with that, but it will be a slow process. Where is the Army to get the extra 3,500 men for which it is looking? Unless confidence in the Armed Forces as a career can be rebuilt, that will not be easy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para51"></a>Clearly, an immense amount of work has been done on smart procurement and defence logistics. This is most welcome, as is the news of closer co-operation between the services, particularly the Navy and the RAF. We are to have a four-star Chief of Defence Logistics. Where is he to fit into the service hierarchy? And will he be a logistician or an ordinary high grade quartermaster? We know that the first incumbent is to be Sir Sam Cowan, the existing QMG. I would advise him that the first bit of equipment that he should procure is a shield for his back.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para52"></a>The Strategic Defence Review is planned to cover the defence of this country for the next 15 years. Let us hope that it is successful. Some of the wording worries me and I implore the Government not to fall into the 10-year rule trap of the 1920s and 1930s. Above all, having made their decisions, will the Government now get on with it? Indecision in the past has led to a major loss of morale which in turn has affected service recruiting, retention and the efficiency of the fighting services themselves. That must be put right, even if the <P>


<a name="column_1268"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1268</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>plans are not perfect. They are not, of course, but service Ministers have been under a great deal of pressure and will continue to be so. I hope that they continue to fight.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, in rising to respond from these Benches, I do so first with an apology from my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire who is currently chairing Sub-Committee F of the Select Committee on the European Communities, which is taking evidence from the Minister of State at the Home Office. My noble friend hopes to be able to rejoin our discussions before we conclude them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para53"></a>In welcoming the Statement, I support the request made by the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, for a full debate on the issues raised as soon as possible. By its own admission, this is a very comprehensive document. It marks a number of radical departures in defence policy and it is difficult to do justice to them in the short time available to us this afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para54"></a>I welcome a number of the review's components. I welcome first the Government's commitment to "jointery"--a new word to me at least, but a powerful one. To those of us who are not imbued with experience of military matters, the distinctions and the degree of rivalry between the forces comes as something of a shock and a surprise. We are pleased to see that the Government are tackling that in a range of ways. It is slightly surprising to hear the fact that two lots of Harrier aircraft are being brought together described as an historic proposal. To many of us, that seems a sensible and long overdue proposal. We wish all strength to the Government's arm in bringing the forces together where that makes for efficiency and sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para55"></a>Secondly, we welcome the rebalancing of the land forces and the decision to create an extra armed brigade. We are pleased that the Government are, in a sense, getting a grip on providing a sensible role for the Territorial Army and ensuring that it is better trained and equipped.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para56"></a>The TA has been in a bit of a limbo. It has been undermanned against targets in many areas and sometimes its equipment has woefully reminded one of a scene from "Dad's Army". While I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, that further details are required, the concept that the TA will be properly equipped and trained for today's rather than yesterday's tasks is a welcome change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para57"></a>We welcome the reduction in the number of Trident warheads. Clearly, that is long overdue and the new level better reflects current realities. We also welcome the introduction of more commercial procurement systems for the Armed Forces. This is a vast raft of public expenditure and it is extremely important that value for money is maintained and enhanced by the introduction of more commercial systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para58"></a>It is remarkable that a foreign policy-led Statement makes not a single reference to our European partners or to the US. The words "Europe" and "US" do not appear anywhere in the Statement. There is only one reference to NATO. It is almost as though in many respects we are considering our international and global <P>


<a name="column_1269"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1269</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>role on its own. It is in that area that I want to ask the Minister a number of questions. First, NATO is already committed to the development of a European security and defence identity within the alliance. Can the Minister explain how that development fits in with the proposals in the Strategic Defence Review?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para59"></a>Secondly, to what extent do the Government envisage that the expeditionary capacity will be exercised independently, or will it provide a contribution to combined forces? If so, with whom and in what circumstances do the Government envisage that occurring in the foreseeable future? In particular, do the Government envisage the expeditionary capacity being used beyond the Mediterranean and the Middle East? For example, can they really envisage joining action in the Indian Ocean or the South China Seas some 30 years after the end of our east of Suez policy?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para60"></a>To return to Europe, given that only the UK and France have a residual power projection capability, has the UK had discussions with the French Government about these plans, in particular the development of a possible joint European capability? Is the reality that the UK intends to follow the US lead even if that conflicts with the views of our European partners?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para61"></a>The Government have made much about this being a foreign policy-based strategy. I hope that the Minister will be able further to clarify the foreign policy objectives that underlie this strategy, not least for the generation of young people for whom full-scale European and global conflict is something to be read about in the history books and for whom "Cool Britannia" has a much greater resonance than "Rule Britannia".

<P>
<A NAME="80708-09_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, first, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, for his generally very helpful remarks--I hope that that does not embarrass him too much--and his endorsement of the comments of the Secretary of State about the scandal of this leak, which mortifies all of us. As the noble Lord has said, it is totally unacceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para62"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Burnham and Lord Newby, whom I welcome to defence debates in this place, asked me about the possibility of a debate on this review. I am certain that we shall have a debate, but as to when that takes place is not within my gift. I relish having such a debate, and the sooner the better, as I shall inform the Chief Whip when I have a chance. But this House is also due a debate on NATO enlargement. That has not been forgotten. I hope that both debates can take place no later than Christmas. I should like them to take place as early as the noble Lord has said, but both he and I are aware of the exigencies of other business.

<A NAME = "80708-09_para63"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Burnham, gently mocked the proposition that this review had not been Treasury-led. I wish only that the noble Lord and other noble Lords had been with me a couple of hours ago when my right honourable friend the Secretary of State gave a press conference. At the end of his statement he invited the Chief of the Defence Staff to make some remarks. The Chief of the Defence Staff informed the assembled <P>


<a name="column_1270"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1270</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>journalists of what we all knew; namely, that the Ministry of Defence had completed its work on the Strategic Defence Review about three months ago. Since then, the review has quite properly been subject to the most rigorous scrutiny by all the other departments which compete for public funds. It has received the most stringent scrutiny by the Treasury as noble Lords would expect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para64"></a>The Chief of the Defence Staff confirmed that the package which left the Ministry of Defence in March was identical to that announced by my right honourable friend this afternoon in another place. The Ministry of Defence began by trying to make greater savings than the Treasury had asked for because it was aware, to quote a commentator on the scene, that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is money to be saved in the MoD. Of course it has been through Frontline First and 'defence cost studies' but, as in the private sector, so in government the process of improving performance has to be continuous". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Those remarks were made in an article entitled "The Case For Defence" in the Parliamentary Monitor of autumn 1997 written by Mr. Michael Portillo. Therefore, we recognised that there were savings to be made. From those savings and the sale of assets that are no longer necessary for the defence estate, we hope to finance the huge enhancements that we are making in capability alongside the much more modest reductions in capability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para65"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Burnham, complained about the absence of a foreign policy baseline. It is an unfortunate accident of politics that he was not engaged in his present responsibilities when the Strategic Defence Review started and therefore was not invited, as were many Members of this House, to a series of seminars hosted by my right honourable friend on the way in which the review should be conducted. The noble Lord's predecessor, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, gave us the benefit of his thoughts on these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para66"></a>I can inform the noble Lord and the House that the Secretary of State has been scrupulous in seeking the opinions of former Chiefs of the Defence Staff, Permanent Secretaries, members of the Armed Forces and many noble Lords in this House, some of whom I have had the pleasure to entertain, in the course of the past 14 months in an attempt to obtain the widest possible range of opinions as to how the foreign policy review should be conducted, what its foreign policy baseline should be and what kinds of resources and assets would be required to implement its conclusions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-09_para67"></a>I noted one slip in the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Burnham. He observed that there would be fewer men in the services. I regret to say that the noble Lord is not well informed. He could not have been listening to the particular passage in the Statement of my right honourable friend. The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force strengths will remain unchanged and the Army's strength will be increased by 3,300. Far from having <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for giving way. I believe that I said "with the exception of the increase in the Armed Services". I was taking into account the Territorial Army.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, so be it. The noble Lord asked me whether or not I was prepared to say that we would build the carriers. I am prepared to say that we will build the carriers. That is the commitment of the whole of this Government, and that also involves Treasury approval. We expect the very earliest expenditure on the longest lead items of research work for the carriers in the next couple of years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para0"></a>The noble Lord, quite fairly, asked me which Territorial Army units and centres will be closed. I cannot answer that question today because the process of working out the implications for individual units has only just started. Noble Lords will wish to know that in principle we are hoping to enhance the roles of the specialist Territorial Army members. We will make the most modern equipment available for them for the first time for their training.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para1"></a>The noble Lord did not mention this point, but my right honourable friend has made it clear that there will be an increase, albeit a modest one, in the resources available for the Army Cadet Force.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para2"></a>The noble Lord quite rightly said that we needed confidence building within the armed services. I quite agree with him. Had he attended the press conference earlier today to which I have referred he would have heard the Chief of the Defence Staff welcoming, unambiguously, the three-year commitment from the Treasury as giving stability for the future of the services. To quote the Chief of the Defence Staff, it will enable security planning to be carried out,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in a way unprecedented in the past". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para3"></a>The noble Lord asked whether the Government will now get on with it. That is quite right; that is the test. Although we have sweated a fair amount of blood over the past year or so in producing this review, the acid test will be whether the Government succeed in implementing it, and that will be a matter for your Lordships' scrutiny as the months roll by.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, paid a compliment to our proposals in "jointery". I should like to pay tribute to the role played by the First Sea Lord personally and the Chief of Air Staff in overcoming old habits, customs and prejudices in both their services. I know that the Secretary of State and other Ministers are intensely grateful to these two distinguished officers and the other military chiefs for their role in helping us to reach the conclusions we did in the defence review and for selling those conclusions to the individual men and women in their services.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para5"></a>I am glad that the noble Lord welcomes the new armoured brigade which we consider will produce a punch that the British Army has never had. I am also <P>


<a name="column_1272"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1272</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>glad to hear his welcome for our radical overhaul of our procurement systems which I personally hope will very much increase the reliability of the equipment we buy and the sustainability of our forces. However, these matters take a long time to germinate and I can foresee many adverse reports from the National Audit Office in future years, although I hope that the background noise from it will be gradually muted as we feel the benefits of smart procurement feeding into the system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, also asked about Europe, the United States and NATO. All our NATO partners were consulted on many occasions in the course of this review. It remains the policy of Her Majesty's Government's to develop the European security and defence identity so long as it is clearly understood that our primary security rests with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para7"></a>The main thrust of this review, in addition to its developed "jointery", has been to give our forces an expeditionary capability that they have not previously enjoyed. The noble Lord asked whether this would be used independently or with combined forces. We anticipate that overwhelmingly it will be used with other countries in combined forces. He asked whether it is likely to be used beyond the Mediterranean and the Gulf. It is not for me to predict where our forces will be deployed or where the next crisis will arise. However, we have exercised with five power defence agreement countries. We had a magnificent exercise out of the Pacific last year, as I am sure the noble Lord is aware.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para8"></a>In relation to the discussion with the French on joint nuclear capability, I know that my right honourable friend frequently talks with his French colleague and from time to time they no doubt discuss "nuclear questions". But these matters are conducted above my pay grade and I am sure that if I did know about them the noble Lord would not expect me to disclose the details.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bramall: </B>   My Lords, I should like, in the face of that interesting, positive and imaginative Statement, to congratulate Ministers on their brave, effective and apparently successful attempt to conduct this review largely from the top downwards, based on foreign policy commitments and required capability, and not, as so often in the past, from the bottom, regulated almost from the outset on the basis of the resources deemed by the Treasury to be necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para9"></a>Of course it is early days, and there has been no opportunity to study the review. Obviously, not everything in it will satisfy everyone and no doubt some parts of it are better than others. However, the review, commendably, appears to have maintained in our Armed Forces a modern up-to-date combat capability for the kind of commitments, both expected and unexpected, which may well confront us as we move into the 20th century and play our appropriate part in international affairs. It has remembered our historic maritime role and has maintained a modern amphibious capability, which I have always considered to be important. It appears to be tackling our logistic sustainability, Army manpower <P>


<a name="column_1273"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1273</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the medical services, which should never have been allowed to get into that state in the first place. I lose no sleep over the small reduction in our nuclear capability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para10"></a>However, I ask for three points of clarification. Does the &#163;600 million to be saved annually by 2001 include the amount received from the immense sales of the defence estate? If it does, it seems to me that, after a major review like this, to have held the line at that figure represents a considerable achievement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para11"></a>Can the Minister enlighten us further on one area that still gives great cause for concern, and that is the substantial reduction, for very small financial reward, of our virtually irreplaceable Army reserve forces? Can he say how much of the reduced figure of 40,000 will be available for combat units of the Territorial Army infantry and yeomanry after the numbers required and earmarked for sustainability and logistic backing have been taken away; and does that figure include the University Training Corps regiments? The former point is important because if too many combat units, which represent the heart and spirit of the Territorial Army as well as the nationwide umbilical cord into the civilian population and the support for cadets, are removed the whole stuffing will go out of the reserve forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para12"></a>If this review represents, as is claimed, the most sweeping, radical and most complete review our Armed Forces have ever had, can the Minister give an assurance that uncertainty will now be removed and that they can be left to get on with their professional job, to recruit up to their maximum numbers and to build up their morale? It would be intolerable if, after all that has happened over the past eight to nine years, they were to find themselves next year or the year after going round this buoy all over again on some contrived pretext of value for money. I am sure a statement that there are to be no more reviews either in this Parliament or the next would do a great deal to restore flagging morale and to enhance recruitment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and gallant Lord, whom I hold in great respect and affection, as he knows, for his kind and generous remarks about our review. He is right. Our expeditionary capability and our amphibious capability lie at the heart of our proposals. I am delighted to be able to put them in front of your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para13"></a>It might be of interest to your Lordships to have a few more details of what we propose for the Defence Medical Services. We propose to procure, as a matter of urgency, a 200-bed primary casualty receiving ship, with a second one in the longer term; 800 more field beds across all three field hospitals will be brought to a higher state of readiness; the Army's regular ambulance evacuation capability will be enhanced; and an additional regular RAF aero-medical evacuation flight and 18 air escort flights will be established. We hope to recruit some 200 specialists and other medical staff into the Defence Medical Services. Within about three years we expect to be spending an additional &#163;40 million a year on the Defence Medical Services.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para14"></a>The noble and gallant Lord asked me about the &#163;600 million. That &#163;600 million will have to be found by efficiencies, and we are confident that it can be <P>


<a name="column_1274"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1274</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>found. The chiefs of staff thought that it could be found out of our budgets. That excludes the sales of defence assets. I cannot give him a precise figure of how much of the TA will be available for combat, but I can assure him that it will be much more than at present. I shall have to look into the point about the university training corps regiments, I confess, and I shall write to the noble and gallant Lord as soon as I possibly can.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-10_para15"></a>I agree with the noble and gallant Lord that it is crucial that uncertainty be removed. I can assure him that it is not the intention of anyone at the MoD, or anywhere else in government as far as I know, to have another review in this Parliament, and I hope not in the next one either.

<A NAME="80708-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, with the exception of the noble and gallant Lord whose expertise the House values, I shall be firm with subsequent speakers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mason of Barnsley: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend must be aware that it is a great relief that he and the Secretary of State did not have to contend with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Labour's Action for Peace, the Tribune Group, and the national executive, because this has been a peaceful review. For most of us in the Labour Party there is not a lot for us to quarrel about.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-11_para0"></a>The review has revealed a major change in strategy, including the prospect of airborne military fire brigades, in liaison with our allies, to dampen down trouble spots beyond our shores. It includes of course within the rapid reaction forces, the development of integrated, inter-service Harrier forces, and I am pleased about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-11_para1"></a>I am pleased that we have maintained a nuclear capability, and that it is to continue. Is there any timescale? Does my noble friend foresee any fresh nuclear missile developments within the force? I am disappointed at the cut-back in the Terriers. I think that we have gone too far, but there is some consolation in the fact that the Army Cadet Force will increase. I noticed in the press--there is a hint in the White Paper--a reference to private sponsorship. Will my noble friend explain? However, I congratulate my noble friend on his well-conducted foreign policy, led by and shared with the Foreign Office. I think that it has been a good government operation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I am of course immensely obliged to my noble friend who of course occupied a position senior to mine at the MoD for many years with great distinction. I take great comfort from what he said. He and I have a certain amount of experience of wrestling with those within my own party who disagreed with us on things nuclear. Therefore it gives me great pleasure to be able to make the announcements that we have made today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-11_para2"></a>I shall answer just one of his points, and I hope that he will forgive me for being brief. So far as concerns the nuclear force's future, I can assure him that when it <P>


<a name="column_1275"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1275</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>comes to considering--it is not yet time to do so-- a successor for Trident, we have taken no decision that would in any way make it impossible for us to contemplate a successor system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister tell us how the TA is to be reduced by 30 per cent. (19,000 men)? Is it to be done by dismissing a large number or by merely stopping recruiting, in which case it will take a long time? What will be the financial saving from that reduction?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, it is unlikely that substantial numbers of people will be dismissed. Such is the rate of turnover in the territorial forces that I hope the process can be handled with the greatest of tact and the minimum of disruption to individual people's lives. Of course, at the end of the day, it is possible that certain units will have to be closed. We shall be taking account of regional loyalties, the need to spread the remaining units across the community as a whole, and to sustaining the bonds that those territorial units have with their local communities. I can assure the noble Lord that all those matters are at the forefront of the mind of my honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces. I have taken part in many discussions on those points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-11_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Carlisle: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the emphasis that Her Majesty's Government have placed on defence diplomacy. I am delighted to see the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, in her place. There is a cut in the number of destroyers and frigates from 35 to 32 and an increasing need to have frigates available for humanitarian tasks. Does the Minister feel that that weakness in the strategic review needs to be corrected?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, if you asked me, I should like to double the amount of money spent on defence in almost every direction. I think that I am on record as being the only Member of the other place who voted for an increase in defence expenditure and voted against the Defence Estimates on the ground that they were too low. But we have to be realistic. We have to balance expenditure on defence against other demands on the public purse. So far as concerns the destroyers and frigates, we no longer face a situation, as we did in the 1950s, the 1960s, and the 1970s, where we might have been contemplating blue-water operations against powerful Warsaw Pact naval forces. The situation has changed greatly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-11_para3"></a>One of the reasons that we took the decisions that we did, which are endorsed by the First Sea Lord--I do not say that he welcomed them, but he thought that it was an acceptable solution--was that we looked at the possibility of submarine warfare, the size of submarine fleets of other navies around the world, where they were, and their capabilities, and we decided that we were not going to need nearly the investment that we have had in the past in the anti-submarine capability. It is as simple as that.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, I speak for myself, which is all that I can do from these Benches. Like my noble and gallant friend, I welcome this constructive, imaginative and forward-looking Statement. In parenthesis, perhaps I may express the hope that the Government will not consider this leak business to be too tragic. Of course it has been a leak, but it is not a revelation to be placed alongside the Apocalypse. We have known for some time largely what the review was going to contain, because the Government have conducted widespread consultations on it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-11_para4"></a>What is important is the content. Here, in deference to the need for brevity, I shall make just one point. The continued commitment to an effective nuclear deterrent is an extremely welcome development, and one which I hope will continue. Have serious strategic calculations been made about the nuclear threat from rogue states and possibly from our former enemies and the ability of possible enemies to protect themselves against nuclear strikes? Were all those taken into account in arriving at the new level of armament for the Trident force?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-11_para5"></a>We shall need an answer to that. We shall need answers to many other questions in the future. However, I conclude by saying that at least for those of us who take defence seriously, it is encouraging to note that the Government also are doing just that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, once again I am deeply indebted to the noble Lord whom I have known for many years and regard highly for his remarks on these subjects. He will know what enormous pleasure it brings me to be able to stand at this Dispatch Box and confirm that we shall always have a Trident submarine out there 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. It was a commitment I was unable to give the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne--unfortunately he is not in his place this afternoon--when he asked me about the matter some months ago in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-11_para6"></a>I am obliged to the noble Lord for his recognition that the Government take defence very seriously indeed. It should also be taken into account that while we have reduced the number of warheads, and have announced the number of warheads we shall deploy, those should not be compared closely with the previous government's disclosed figure because that was a ceiling figure. The previous government--I do not quarrel with their judgment--saw fit never to disclose the number of warheads being deployed at sea at any one time. I hope that that meets the noble Lord's point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for repeating the Statement made in another place. However, I fail to detect in it any realisation whatever that the world is in grave peril unless something is done to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Our civilisation is in peril, even conceivably the life of humanity itself. Under those circumstances, it is with great regret that I regard the speech which my noble friend was obliged to repeat in this House as inadequate in that respect, if in no other.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-11_para7"></a>I shall confine myself to this single point. We are told that the review--I have it in my hand--was Foreign Office led. The words "nuclear elimination" are popular in the Foreign Office. I am sure that my noble friend Lady Symons--I am glad to see her in her seat--will confirm that. I understand that those words are not popular in the Ministry of Defence. That was confirmed by the fact that I did not hear my noble friend mention the words "nuclear elimination". Although I have not been able to read it fully, I was unable to discover any mention of those words in the Statement. That is all I have to say. I shall make further comments in the debate to which we all look forward. In the meantime, I ask my noble friend to confirm that the policy of nuclear elimination is not only the policy of the Foreign Office but also of the Ministry of Defence and the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-11_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, it will always be difficult for me to find forms of words which will make my noble friend Lord Jenkins happy on matters nuclear. However, I can confirm that it is the policy of Her Majesty's Government to work towards a nuclear-free world. I also hope that we work towards a world that does not have bombs, bayonets, machine guns and other rather unpleasant instruments in it. I merely point out to my noble friend that far more people have been killed by conventional means in the past 50 years than were killed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki put together.

<A NAME="80708-12_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Fookes: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister assist my memory? If one adds to this review the cuts in costs from the previous review, what is the total cut in the Armed Forces over the past eight years or so?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness tempts me. It is a sad story. I was not going to mention such figures because I did not want to bring grief to noble Lords sitting opposite. The fact is that in the last seven years of the previous government defence expenditure in this country was cut by 23.5 per cent. That is why I voted against the Defence Estimates at that time. If one adds to that what my right honourable friend proposes, it represents another modest 3 per cent. over the next three years.

<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para2"></a>This is a straightforward amendment. We do not need to worry too much about the consequential amendments that go with it. The amendment relates to the voting system. Not only are the Government proposing major <P>


<a name="column_1278"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1278</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>constitutional changes to the way we have governed the United Kingdom for many years; they are also proposing major changes to the voting system. It is a system to which we have become accustomed and one which I and many others believe has served this country and the rest of the English-speaking world extraordinarily well over the long march of history.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para3"></a>In this Bill, the European Parliamentary Elections Bill, and the Welsh Bill, the Government intend to replace the traditional first-past-the-post system with a system of proportional representation. The amendment removes from the Bill all those parts which introduce proportional representation. If I were successful, and the Committee were to agree with me, the Bill would have a first-past-the-post electoral system for the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para4"></a>I have no doubt that the Minister will tell me--if he does not someone else will--that I am looking a gift horse in the mouth. Earlier today the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, told me that the Government were magnanimously throwing a lifebelt to the Conservative Party in Scotland. That is the weakest of all arguments for a change in electoral systems. (I thought that I might receive support on that!) I do not believe that one should campaign to change electoral systems simply because at one point in time a party would gain some electoral advantage from it; and, conversely, because the electoral system that we have had for many years has worked against a party in one or more elections. That is not a good argument for choosing electoral systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para5"></a>The Bill creates two classes of Members of Parliament in the Scottish parliament. Two-thirds will be elected in a conventional first-past-the-post system. The other one third will be wholly unaccountable to the electorate as individuals. Because of that, it will also transfer power from individuals to the political parties. It will add complication to what I believe is a simple democratic system which has served this country well for a long time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para6"></a>At present--I hope that it may soon end--the case for the first-past-the-post system is not being heard as clearly as it should be. The commission set up by the Government has been told not to consider the merits of the first-past-the-post system. It has only to consider proportional representation--the different methods of fiddling the voting system and what fiddle tune should be chosen. As I have said before to your Lordships, it seems odd that a review of the electoral system should be set up consisting entirely of people who are signed-up members of not first-past-the-post.

<A NAME="80708-12_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I have asked the noble Lord before to withdraw that representation of the Jenkins Commission. It is inaccurate. The commission is not designed to review the electoral system. It is designed to produce one runner from a stable to run against first-past-the-post. Any supporter of first-past-the-post <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>on the commission would suffer from a severe conflict of interest. I hope the noble Lord will not repeat that argument.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I shall, because every time I repeat it I receive the kind of assurance that I have just had. The more times that I have that assurance, the better I am pleased. The fact is that when the Jenkins Commission brings forward its proposals, we can rest assured that the fanatics for PR will not make that fine distinction. It will be said, "That is the proposal these wise men have come up with to knock down first-past-the-post". The fact that the commission has not considered first-past-the-post means that such an argument would be bogus. Therefore, I welcome the noble Earl to my side in that regard. I shall quote him, as I shall be quoting the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, when the Jenkins Commission reports. I shall remind the world, or the country at least, in the words of both noble Lords that that commission did not even consider first-past-the-post. It did not look at it merits or demerits. No judgment was made against first-past- the-post. The members of the commission are a narrowly drawn band of brothers and sisters who believe fervently and who have tried to choose the best system to run against first-past-the-post. It is interesting that it is such a complicated world that a commission has to be set up to decide that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   I agree with the final point which the noble Lord made. But does he agree that perhaps the best way to test out PR is to see whether it actually works? Perhaps the Scottish parliament proposal that we have part first-past-the-post and part PR might be a very good litmus test.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   It is an interesting thought that Scotland should be used as a guinea-pig for first-past- the-post. I can see that Members of the Committee appreciate the argument and I shall not go further with that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para7"></a>First-past-the-post gives us clear accountability at constituency and national level. The accountability is clear. It allows the electorate to remove the governing party if it no longer retains the confidence of the electorate. That is something that my party experienced fairly severely a year ago. Under the British system, by and large, the verdict is decisive. An unpopular government cannot be kept in office by a minor party against the will of the electorate. Nor can a minor party decide to change the government without going to the electorate. There is clear accountability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para8"></a>I suppose it is my advantage, or sometimes my disadvantage, that I am involved with all three Bills, so I can read across the government case from one to the other. However, it is interesting to note what the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, said on the European Parliamentary Elections Bill when advocating the list system, which the Government hope to introduce into the European parliamentary system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para9"></a>In his comments on the Bill both on Second Reading and in Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, underlined the important difference between <P>


<a name="column_1280"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1280</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the European Parliament and the other place and the elections to the European Parliament and the elections to the other place. We must also bracket with the other place both the Welsh assembly and especially the Scottish parliament, which is a much more powerful body than the Welsh assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams, pointed out to me that the European Parliament does not have a government arising from it. Of course, the Scottish parliament will have. The noble Lord pointed out to me when we were discussing the Bill that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Different elections require different systems and the key determining factor is the nature and functions of the body or legislature that is being elected". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He added later,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The European Parliament, unlike our own, is not one from which a government is drawn". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The Scottish parliament will be a body from which a government is drawn, so to that extent it is more akin to the House of Commons and to the arguments used by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, regarding the House of Commons than to the European Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para11"></a>The noble Lord went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We take the view that electoral systems should be appropriate for the particular bodies being elected. Our Parliament has a very different function from that performed by the European Parliament and we believe that different considerations obtain".--[Official Report, 9/4/98; cols. 857-9.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Amen to that, I say.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para12"></a>Summing up later in the debate he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not, I repeat, a Parliament from which a government is chosen".--[Official Report, 9/4/98; col. 899.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
But like the other place, this Scottish parliament is a parliament from which a government is chosen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para13"></a>I mentioned accountability and direct accountability and the fact that the first-past-the-post system is extremely efficient at removing an unpopular party from power. Proportional representation can keep one party, usually a very small party, in power for almost ever and ever. It just shifts its alliances and partners in an elaborate dance and is never properly accountable to the electorate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para14"></a>It is interesting that in one or two of the countries where PR has developed there are occasions on which the larger parties get so fed up with the situation that they form grand coalitions in order to overcome the dictatorship of the minnows. Unfortunately, the grand coalitions do not usually last very well and they probably do not provide very good government. But they are an attempt to make sure that the tail does not continually wag the dog.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para15"></a>There is also the question of the accountability of Members of Parliament. Of course, the system that we are looking at today, unlike the European Parliament election system, will have members elected on a constituency basis. To that extent, I can see that the Government will argue that as regards the constituency base the additional member system is something of a compromise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para16"></a>However, there will be 56 members of the Scottish parliament who will not be elected by constituencies as we know them. They will be elected because they have <P>


<a name="column_1281"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1281</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been put on the party list; and unless your Lordships are quite vigilant later on, the party list may not even appear on the ballot paper unless we do something about it. But there will be a party list; the party will decide the list; and there will not be much relationship between the electorate and the individuals. The individuals will have much more interest in keeping in with their party than they will in keeping in with the electorate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para17"></a>Therefore, while I accept that the system before us has a certain element of constituency link, it is greatly diluted by the 56 additional members. Everybody who has been a Member of the other place knows that that link can sometimes be a bit of a pain on a wet Saturday morning at surgery. But it is a good way of keeping Members of Parliament in touch not just with the people who voted for them but also with a lot of people who did not vote for them. There will not be a single Member of your Lordships' House who was a Member of the other place who would not say that many of the people who came to surgeries in particular and who wrote letters never voted for the Member of Parliament in question. That was certainly my experience. I remember going with one noble Lord in an aeroplane when he was a Member of the other place. We were talking about our surgeries and he said he thought most of his people did not vote at all. I should not go quite as far as that, but certainly in any parliamentary constituency a number of the people who visit the surgery do not vote for the Member.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para18"></a>The problem with the additional member system is that it will be a case of, "Oh well, why don't you go and see Jimmy Smith who is a member of your own party? Why not go and talk to him? He will deal with you". There will be some shuffling about. Or it may be said, "Oh, that's not my expertise. The other regional member, that is his expertise. Why don't you go to see him?"
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para19"></a>Members of the other place cannot do that and by and large--I go further--they do not do it. Indeed, if another Member of Parliament encroaches on their territory, they become stroppy about that. There is a convention in the other place that you do not take up cases of other Members of Parliament, because each individual member of Parliament is the sole representative of all his constituents. Therefore, that is an important link that will be lost in relation to the 56 members.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para20"></a>The first-past-the-post system has undoubtedly over time given us stable and effective government in this country. By and large, the governing party has had a working majority in the House of Commons and has been able to take its programme through the full course of a parliament. It has also enabled governing parties to get their business through another place and even to use that argument to get the business through your Lordships' House, even when your Lordships are not too keen on the business in hand. It also tends, because of what is called the "cube rule"--although perhaps now a square rule--to give the winning party a healthy majority. That means that it is able to govern effectively without having to rely on other parties, wherever they come from.
<P>


<a name="column_1282"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1282</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para21"></a>Therefore, on whatever basis one looks at it, it seems to me that first-past-the-post has served this country well. When it comes to continuing with electoral systems in Scotland and Wales, I believe that what we have in this country is every bit as good as anything that they have in any other part of the world. I am prepared to say that we ought to stick to our current system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para22"></a>Moreover, it also has the advantage that it forces the the main political parties to take broad views. One of the problems of PR, especially with a multiplicity of small parties, is that the parties involved can become very narrow because they do not have to encompass a broad view. Normally we call it a "broad church" in this country. All the parties are a broad church. I suspect that the Liberal Democrats are a fairly broad church, as, indeed, is the party opposite. We have just had a defence Statement repeated in this Chamber, and you cannot get a broader church than the Labour Party has been over the years on defence. My party is also a broad church and that is only right. If parties narrow themselves, that is certainly bad for them, as well as being bad for democracy in the country. I believe that PR systems encourage that narrowness, whereas our first-past-the-post system discourages it; and, indeed, punishes parties which become too narrow in their appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para23"></a>When it comes to choosing the governing party and selecting constituency representation, I believe that our system is the best one for us. I am not going to say that it is superior, and I do not want to hear anyone say that it is inferior; it is the best one for us. I would not go to those countries that have PR systems and tell them that they ought to change. Indeed, as I said in a previous debate, I do not want to hear about other countries that run PR and how magically they do so. We could trade countries on voting systems, but I believe that the voting system that a country arrives at is the one that suits it. That is what our amendments would do. It is interesting to note that New Zealand, which shifted to PR, is now desperately wondering how it can shift back to first-past-the-post.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para24"></a>Perhaps I may leave the Committee with a few additional words in case anyone in the party opposite or in the party beside me wants to get up and tell me that this is just the Conservative Party making a last ditch stand. I have with me a copy of a letter from the noble Lord, Lord Islwyn, printed in the Western Mail, which has become my morning reading with my interest in the Welsh Bill. Unfortunately, the noble Lord is not in his place today, but he is quite happy about his letter. In fact, the headline in the newspaper reads, "PR Could Be a Trojan Horse, Warns Islwyn", and the letter says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As an inveterate supporter of the 'First-Past-the-Post' system I believe that policies for a future government on an elected Assembly"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
that is, the Welsh assembly--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should be placed before the electorate by the respective parties at an election. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>What we have witnessed on the continent and elsewhere is policy decided after an election by a mish-mash of parties behind closed doors. This could now be the result for the Welsh Assembly under the additional member system of proportional representation". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1283"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1283</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
So the noble Lord is quite clear in that respect. Finally, those noble Lords who take part in the proceedings on the Welsh Bill will not be surprised to know that, on 1st July, after a debate about PR and while the Solicitor-General was replying to the debate and trying to explain all the complexities involved, the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan of Cardiff, was moved to intervene. He said that if anyone could make a subject clear he reckoned that it was the Solicitor-General, but that if he had made anything clear to the noble Lord, it was simply this: it confirmed him in his position that the first-past-the-post system is easily the best system. I concur, I trust that Members of the Committee will. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   I listened with great attention to the noble Lord, especially his generosity in saying that the first-past-the-post system had rightly punished his party by extinguishing it from Scotland and putting the Opposition in with the biggest majority that we have seen for a long time. Those are noble sentiments, which I appreciate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para25"></a>However, we are discussing the first-past-the-post system. I am a very old man and I remember many things about the system. I remember the time just after the war when we had nationalisation of steel, denationalisation of steel and renationalisation of steel. I also remember that we came out of the war with our industry intact and in a strong position; indeed, better than other countries in Europe. In our good government, through the first-past-the-post system, we have now come to a state where practically every country in Europe is better off than we are. For example, Germany, France and even Italy are much better off than we are under the different system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para26"></a>As regards New Zealand, if it had had first-past-the-post, analysis says that it would have been in exactly the same position as it has come to under PR. Therefore, I do not believe that the first-past-the-post argument is any good. All the amendment would do is destroy the regional system. I do not want to say that it will benefit us in the Liberal Democrat Party because it will not. The evidence suggests that we will gain a large number of seats under the first-past-the-post system and that under the system proposed we probably would not gain any extra seats. However, despite that, we are still for PR. We are still for the Tory Party being represented in Scotland. It is certainly right and proper that the Tories should be represented, however badly they perform.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para27"></a>I turn now to the question of the 56 members who are elected having a lovely time doing nothing and passing the buck from one to the other. Of course, there may be something in that, but most Members today spend far too much time on constituency matters which should be handled by local government. They are hog-tied to constituency work when they should be thinking of other matters. Indeed, it would not be a bad thing at all to have someone to help in that process.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-12_para28"></a>I think that this is a bad amendment. I shall not go into all the issues which spring from it because we will be discussing such matters later. We are rather against the amendment; in fact, we are totally against it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   I listened to what the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, said about constituency responsibility and whether Members or Parliament spend too much time on such work, and that reminded me of an argument which has been going on for a very long time. I remember Nye Bevan once chastising Jennie Lee on the basis that she spent too much time in her constituency and telling her that she had not been elected to be a social worker.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para0"></a>In my experience, constituency work has increased over the years largely because of centralisation of power and many local government councillors have given up the ghost of being able to do anything at all. I have no particular romantic attachment to constituency work. In my view, the only thing worse than the situation described by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, of being involved in such work on a wet Saturday morning is being involved on a bright Saturday morning; indeed, that is infinitely worse. Of course, there are two schools of thought as to whether constituency work is of any benefit to a sitting Member of Parliament. Some people take the view that the more people you see at a constituency surgery the less chance you have of being re-elected because you satisfy very few people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para1"></a>However, I shall leave that aside and pass on to the main argument about proportional representation versus first-past-the-post. I must admit that I am at times a little old fashioned. I was certainly brought up in the tradition that the purpose of having an election was to gain a majority of seats in Parliament so that, thereafter, you could implement your election manifesto and exercise power.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para2"></a>Contrary to the views of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, I am not sure that the first-past-the-post system has punished parties which have become out of touch with the electorate. In my view first-past-the-post kept the previous Conservative government in place long after it should have expired. It appeared that over the 18 years nothing we could do in subsequent elections could budge the then government. None of us knows why people vote as they do at a certain time. Some people say that the Falklands war saved Mrs. Thatcher, now the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher. However, I must admit that I have a sentimental attachment to first-past-the-post.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para3"></a>However, I am primarily opposed to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, because it does away with regional representation. I know in the part of the world I come from, the city of Aberdeen and its surrounds, there is a great deal of distrust of the central belt. I do not wish to upset my honourable and noble friends who come from the Forth/Clyde Valley. However, in the north east of Scotland we have a healthy disrespect and suspicion of people in the Forth/Clyde Valley. At the time when the SNP was at its height, I received a letter with the heading, "Labour voter turning SNP". The letter contained a great tirade about the great number of people coming to Aberdeen <P>


<a name="column_1285"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1285</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to work in the oil industry. They were referred to as foreigners and classic Alf Garnett types. According to the letter writer, these people were simultaneously taking the best jobs and living on the dole. They were causing overcrowding in the schools and lengthening the housing waiting lists. The letter comprised several pages. It finished, "Send them all back where they belong, to Glasgow". That is a true story.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para4"></a>Another anecdote reminds me of how people feel in our part of the world. I recall that during the devolution debates in the other place in the 1970s I made what I thought was a spoof speech to illustrate the way in which the people of Grampian in particular had their own almost sub-nationalist feeling of alienation from the rest of Scotland. In the speech I said that I intended to establish a new political party, the Grampian unilateral independence party, to be known as the GUIDIES for short. I said that if we drew the boundaries correctly--it would be a narrow band along the coast of Grampian, including the city of Aberdeen--we would have a parliamentary socialist majority. If we then projected the lines out in the right way, it would be a case of Grampian's oil and not Scotland's oil. I thought that was a funny speech. Some of my friends--I still had a few in those days--told me they thought it was a funny speech. I thought it was funny until over the next two to three weeks I received about 50 letters from people asking how they could join the party. Irony never comes across on paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para5"></a>However, there is a serious point here. Although I do not know Caithness and Sutherland as well as some noble Lords, my wife comes from a small village, Canesbay, in Caithness. I am a frequent visitor there. People in that village have their own culture and are almost sub-nationalists. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, who comes from the southern part of the country, will recognise in his heart of hearts that in the Borders there is also scepticism about the centre. We have to live with the fact that the Scottish population is concentrated in the Forth/Clyde Valley. I can understand that the members for the Forth/Clyde Valley take a great interest in what is happening there. The greatest deprivation in Scotland is to be found in the Forth/Clyde Valley. I have been to some parts of Glasgow where the poverty and deprivation are enormous. It is a culture shock to see that, especially when one comes from the north east of Scotland where we have a first-class health service. However, nothing is perfect. We have to address certain issues. We have nothing in the north east of Scotland. People will argue that rural poverty is worse than urban poverty, but I do not agree with that. If you suffer from poverty and deprivation it does not matter whether you live in a city or in the country. Therefore I can understand that members for the Forth/Clyde Valley will seek to address those problems, but they should not ignore what is happening elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para6"></a>People in the new Scottish parliament will want to prove that their actions are effective. It is natural, however, that they will seek to look after the interests of those areas where the majority of the population live. That is where the majority of the members of parliament will come from. Despite my reservations about the arguments for first-past-the-post versus proportional <P>


<a name="column_1286"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1286</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>representation, I believe that this additional member system with the eight regions and seven additional members from each region is an honest attempt to spread the influence of the parliament to enable it to be truly representative. It is worth while pursuing on those merits alone, and on that basis alone I believe that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, should be defeated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-13_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am trying to envisage what the parliament is likely to look like. As a result of the list system there is likely to be a wider spread of parties in the parliament. It appears that everyone will have to be a little more consensual. We have been discussing the pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills. If a Bill is to go forward in the parliament, both its drafting and its content will have to be examined. I can picture a scene where it will be hardly possible at all to get a Bill about schools in Scotland, for example, launched in the parliament as there will not be sufficient agreement about the content to launch it. Will the Minister reply to that point?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para7"></a>In the report of the Constitution Unit on the way in which different parliaments are set up and whether they have a second chamber, it is stated that PR is a helpful system and that it should be helpful as regards the parliament we are discussing. I can see that working as regards European-type legislation, which is framework legislation within which one administers, but our kind of legislation is precise. It is not just that every word matters but the precise content is clear. Will it be possible to achieve agreement at the start in an evenly balanced body? That is a question that is well worth thinking about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-13_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   When I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes of Woodside, I was reminded that every time I have been in Glasgow I have been complimented on how well I speak English and that I speak it awfully well for a foreigner. In the context of this Bill, whenever I think of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, I think of Italy. I cannot think why that is the case. I am therefore reminded of an incident right at the end of the war when my parents had an Italian cook. She was a partisan and a refugee with a passionate hatred of fascism. To my parents' great astonishment, on the news of the death of Mussolini, they found her in a profound state of grief. They asked her why she felt such grief. She replied, "He not suffer enough". As Mussolini was hanged with thin wire, this caused my parents some surprise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para8"></a>When I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, speaking of his party and first-past-the-post in the Scottish parliament, I am much reminded of that Italian cook. I know the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, says that this is a weak argument and that he has a soul above such things. He reminds me of the magnificent dedication to principle of Sir Stafford Cripps in 1951, arguing that a pre-election Budget must be immoral, and therefore forcing his party into a February election in the most appalling weather, which it lost by a whisker while winning a majority of the votes.

<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para9"></a>The noble Lord's principle does him great credit. His self-denying ordinance moves me to some admiration. But even though he is under that inhibition, I am under no such inhibition. I am entitled, even if he is not, to believe that in the Scottish parliament first-past-the-post would work to the systematic disadvantage of the Conservative Party. I believe that that is bad for democracy, even if he does not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para10"></a>We hear constantly about the virtues of the single-member constituency. Those virtues are sung much more often by single members than they are by voters. When I look at my own postbag, I am constantly reminded of the weakness of the single-member constituency. A great many people write to me and, I am sure, to many other Members of this House because they are not covered by the Bridlington agreement against "poaching" which prevents MPs from taking up each other's cases. I cannot count the number of letters I have received about the Child Support Act from people who have written to their constituency MP and found absolutely no sympathy or understanding whatever. There are a great many people who can get along and communicate with one MP and not with another. There are a great many subjects that can be taken to one MP and not to another. We should have a slightly more open mind about the virtues of the single-member constituency. A choice of members can be very much to the advantage of the voter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para11"></a>The noble Lord argued, as he always does, about the power of third parties. He appears to think that third parties exist in an electoral vacuum and that they never have to compete for votes. However, if he studies, for example, the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, he will observe that the behaviour of the third party there has been much influenced by the changing attitudes of the electorate. In many parliaments a third party will be given only one option by voters. So in those cases voters must dictate its option. In others, third parties are no more immune to electoral considerations than first or second parties. So the voters will have a considerable input. The hermetic ceiling that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, supposes is a great deal less likely than he thinks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para12"></a>The noble Lord talked about stable and effective government. Stable? I am not quite sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, would have agreed. Effective? It depends what is meant by the word. I said last Monday that I was dealing with the second measure that I had seen through from Second Reading to repeal; namely, the Child Support Act. The other was the poll tax. There is a certain relativeness about the concept of effectiveness. I am inclined to think that the Government who came to power under the first-past-the-post system were, in practical terms, not quite as effective as the noble Lord thought.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para13"></a>I recommend to the noble Lord the maxim of John Stuart Mill: "When has there been a dominion which has not appeared natural to those who possessed it?".

<A NAME="80708-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   I have been interested to hear some of the comments in this debate about the role of the constituency Member. I remember being told many years ago about the way in which Duncan Sandys responded when he was called to account for rarely turning up in his constituency. He replied robustly that his job was to represent Streatham in Parliament, not Parliament in Streatham. On the whole, I believe that one of the most important of all the activities carried out by a Member of Parliament, and the one which keeps his or her feet on the ground and makes him or her a useful Member of Parliament is contact with ordinary people in the constituencies. I assure the noble Earl that when I was first elected to Parliament for Nelson and Colne, there were not that many Conservatives about the place. My postbag was certainly not full of letters only from Conservatives. I received letters from members of all parties. It did me a lot of good to have to deal with the problems of all manner of people and hold surgeries which often kept me on a Saturday from 9.30 in the morning to three or four o'clock in the afternoon. It was character-forming. I did not like it all the time, but it is certainly an important part of an MP's work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-13_para14"></a>It is crucially important to bear in mind that this new system of voting will produce two classes of members of parliament--one class whose members will be accountable to the electors and another class who will have no specific responsibilities to any particular group of electors and who will not be accountable to any group of electors within the region.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   Surely the noble Lord has not really examined the Bill. Those from the regional lists will be responsible to the people in the regions. Their duty will be to look after the regions. A false dichotomy is being thrown up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   That depends on the size of the region and the part of the region from which the individual comes. Someone who is plucked off the party list, for whom nobody will have voted as an individual, will then be expected to have a relationship with a particular person who comes along and asks him or her for assistance. I cannot believe that that will result in members of the parliament plucked off the regional lists feeling that they have a relationship with the electorate remotely like the relationship between a Member of Parliament and the constituency that he represents on a first-past-the-post basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   There are amendments coming up for debate which would connect the voter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   I know that very well. But at present we are confronted with a scheme put forward by the Government which does not connect the member of parliament plucked off the party list with any particular voters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-14_para0"></a>I know that the noble Earl did not raise the argument today but very often one hears Members from the Liberal Benches talking as if the only object of an electoral system is to produce members of parliament <P>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1289</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who reflect with mathematical accuracy the strength of the parties in the country as a whole. That is an absolute nonsense. It may be important to have some equivalence between the votes cast for a party and the number of people who are elected, but it is much more important to finish up with effective government, and with members of parliament who give good service to their electors. Without wishing to repeat myself, my worry is that this scheme, by creating two classes of members of parliament, will in fact create one class of members who will be of very little service to the electors to whom, nominally, they are supposed to be responsible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-14_para1"></a>I agree with my noble friend's opening remarks. Our traditional system has served us well. We are not in the business of supporting one particular system because we believe it may give us an advantage at this point in time. Shifting coalitions have not produced good government in other countries. I strongly believe that our system of first-past-the-post has created in this country governments which, broadly speaking, have represented the wishes of the public, and when they have ceased to do so at the ensuing general election, the public, have let them know quite forcefully, as they did a short time ago, that they have lost the confidence of the electorate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-14_para2"></a>It may well be that normally the Free Democrats in Germany manage in some mysterious way to sense the general views of the electorate and throw their weight on the side of this or that larger party. But it seems a very unsatisfactory way of doing things. It seems much more important that there should be absolute clarity in these matters and that when the electorate says clearly, "You, the Government, have lost our confidence", that government disappear simply because they do not have enough seats. I wholeheartedly support the scheme which is proposed by the series of amendments moved from these Benches.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin: </B>   I rise to support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. I listened carefully to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, whose speeches in this House I frequently find fascinating, but I have to admit that I found him less than impressive tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-14_para3"></a>I also listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes. He and I got into another place at the same election, in 1970. I was elected for a highly marginal seat which I had to nurse for 13 years and to which I hung on by the skin of my teeth at most elections. He was fortunate enough to be elected for a very safe seat and, like all Members for safe seats, had very little worry when an election was announced. The difference between us is reflected in the views which we have put forward this evening. For example, the noble Lord indicated that he did not consider that the constituency link was vitally important. As one who sat for 13 years for a highly marginal seat, I found it extremely important. Indeed, when I lost it, I was out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-14_para4"></a>However well intentioned the Bill may be in proposing two different types of MP, that situation will have consequences with regard to the constituency link. I believe that that link is of vital importance. You cannot hope to know the down-to-earth problems of your constituency unless you hold regular surgeries and meet <P>


<a name="column_1290"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1290</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regularly with those who voted for you and those who did not. Someone said that most of the people who go to surgeries vote for no one, and there may be some truth in that, but one meets a wide cross-section of one's constituency. For that reason, I believe that that link is an essential ingredient which should not be cast aside lightly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-14_para5"></a>The Bill tries in various ways to do things differently from the way they are done at Westminster. The great idea seems to be, "Let's do it differently from Westminster". The noble Lord, Lord Steel, referred to leaving it to the Scottish parliament to decide various things. That is all very well, but good guidelines must be given in the first instance. The Scottish parliament will have a great many members who have never been members of a parliament before and have no experience of government or parliament. It is up to us in this Parliament to set out as clearly as possible what might be for the best.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-14_para6"></a>I do not want to continue for too long. This has been a fairly lengthy debate for a small amendment, and most of what I had intended to say has already been said. However, I wish to put one point to the Government. If this system is so wonderful and so ideal, why is it not to be introduced for Westminster at the next election? I would have thought that, if it represented the best way forward, the sooner it were introduced, the better. There must be a reason. I have my own theory, but I will not deploy it at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, I am sorry if I gave the impression that I discounted entirely the constituency connection. I find it extremely valuable. But I am not sure that the best way of learning how a constituency operates is through the Saturday morning surgery. I believe that the value of the constituency link is in the meetings with interests of business, trade and education and the whole panoply of issues which come up in constituency party work. That link will be maintained by the constituency-elected members. I do not think that those who do not have a constituency are any less worthy because they do not have that link.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin: </B>   I accept what the noble Lord said, and I know the point he is making. I do not believe that experience in other countries where the constituency link has been dispensed with necessarily indicates that that is a good system. I disagree with those who say that better government has been provided by that system than by first-past-the-post.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-14_para7"></a>Like the noble Lord, the former Member for Aberdeen North, I was brought up on the first-past-the-post system, and I suppose that I have a bias towards it because of that. Where anything in which one believes strongly is concerned, I think that the argument for change must always be made by those who want the change. The argument for change in this case has not convinced me.

<a name="column_1291"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1291</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments, which seek to remove the provision in the Bill for regional members. Perhaps it would be useful if at this stage I dealt with the specific questions put to me by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, and the noble Lord, Lord Gray of Contin.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-14_para8"></a>As far as I understand the question--I hope I have got it right--the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, asked how a Bill could be launched when there was not an automatic majority for it in the Scottish parliament because the electoral system would not produce a straight majority. We see as one of the great merits of what we are proposing the fact that it will be necessary for the executive, in putting forward a Bill, not simply to introduce it and rely on simple majoritarianism to get it through, but to build support and argue its case through the process of scrutiny and deliberation, to which we referred on the earlier amendment. One hopes that the electoral system itself will generate the working together and consensus and support building that is necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-14_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I do not wish to hold matters up, but I believe that this is a quite different point from any others that have been made. I gave an example of a Bill about schools. I have great difficulty in imagining how one will achieve this lovely consensus for a Bill that will make the radical changes that are perhaps necessary in Scottish schools. I personally think that something has to happen; I am prepared to go in for a lot of give and take. Does the noble Lord really believe that such a Bill would get off the ground? Given the disagreement that will exist, I wonder how many Bills will get started in this parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-14_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   No one is trying to pretend that consensus building is easy; it is not. It involves a lot of hard work and difficulty in persuading people of the nature of the argument and the case that is being made. It is not a case of all being jolly good chaps or "chapesses" together.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-15_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   If I may offer a little comfort to the Minister, what he describes is the way in which Bills have gone through the Westminster Parliament for at least seven-eighths of its history; and it has worked.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I was going to say, "as always", but, as in the majority of cases, I am enormously grateful to the noble Earl.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para0"></a>I now turn to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Gray of Contin, about why we are not immediately introducing a similar electoral system into Westminster elections. In this case we are setting up a new parliament and are making a judgment about what is the appropriate electoral system for that parliament. At Westminster we have an established Parliament. We have indicated that the Jenkins Commission is considering an alternative to the present system. That alternative will be put to the people in a referendum and they will be able to decide whether to stay with the status quo or move to a new system. When one is dealing with an established parliament, that seems to be a sensible way in which to proceed.
<P>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1292</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para1"></a>Perhaps it would be useful if I reminded noble Lords of the Government's position on this issue. We wish to create a Scottish parliament by means of a combination of the simple-majority system and the additional-member system of proportional representation. That was proposed in the White Paper and endorsed in the referendum. The noble Lord's amendments strike at the heart of the electoral arrangements that were proposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para2"></a>We stated in the White Paper that, while a constituency link will be the essential foundation of the parliament, we wanted to provide for greater proportionality to build stability into the overall settlement. We proposed that there will be a significant number of additional members elected on a wider and proportional basis in order to bring a closer relationship between votes cast and seats won. That is what is being delivered in the Bill and I hope that Members of the Committee will be able to support it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para3"></a>The Government believe that the regional member system in the Bill is an essential part of the arrangements for the Scottish parliament. Its purpose is to reduce the imbalance in political representation which can arise when one depends solely on the simple majority system at elections. As members of the Committee will appreciate, the "winner takes all" aspects of the simply majority mean that a party can secure a significant number of votes but gain no seats. As a result, the electorate can feel disenfranchised and distanced from parliament because they feel there is no one to reflect their views.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para4"></a>It is not simply a matter of which system benefits individual parties; it is the relationship that the elector feels with the political system as a whole. If, somehow, their preference cannot be reflected through the seats gained by the party they support, there is a risk of a deep cynicism and alienation overtaking the electorate and that is something of which we should be wary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para5"></a>There is also the problem, particularly in a multi-party system--this is the case much more so in Scotland normally, though there is the argument that one could offer a Society for the Preservation of Parties at Risk in Scotland; I do not know how many members would subscribe to it, but it is growing--that a relatively small change in the distribution of votes can result in an enormously disproportionate effect on the number of seats won. That is one of the well-known and recognised problems of multi-party systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para6"></a>Perhaps I can refer to the election of 1997, though it is borne out in a number of other elections in Scotland. If we look at the relationship between votes cast and seats won, my party in that election obtained 44.5 per cent. of the vote and secured 78 per cent. of the seats in Scotland. The Conservative Party obtained 17.5 per cent. of the popular vote and obtained no seats. The Liberal Democrats obtained 13 per cent. of the vote and 14 per cent. of the seats. The Scottish National Party obtained 22.1 per cent. of the electoral vote and 8 per cent. of the seats. If that sort of imbalance was sustained over a period of time, there would be a sense of deep unfairness within the electorate of Scotland. People would demand change, and I believe rightly.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para7"></a>One of the concerns expressed in 1978 was that the parliament then proposed would be dominated by members from the central belt. We have tried to construct an electoral system which answers that sort of case. The system we propose in the Bill will create an opportunity for parties to have members returned from parts of Scotland which have hitherto been a lost cause. There will be no wasted votes in Scotland because of the electoral system. Each region should have representatives from each of the parties, thus ensuring a balance of views in the parliament and avoiding the dominance of one area over another.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para8"></a>We will end what in some elections has been a dramatic, geographical segmentation of party representation in Scotland where one party has been associated with a specific geographical area of Scotland and only with that geographical area. That is wrong. This electoral system means that all the political parties in Scotland will be truly the parties of the whole of Scotland, drawing their support and their representation from all the regions. I believe that that is fundamentally healthy for the Scottish political system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-15_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   Before the Minister leaves that subject, can he say whether there is a danger in having two kinds of MSP--regional members and constituency members? Anyone who has sat as such, as I have, and my noble friend, will know that one is chased by constituents with a problem and very often the problem is insoluble. At that point one says, "Ask your regional MSP to deal with it." There is a good deal of passing the buck between the two, if not direct rivalry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I do not believe that there will be a case of passing the buck. What will happen is that the individual constituent will have a choice of people to whom he can go. Again, that is to the good. The individual constituent will decide whether he wishes to write to, or see, the member of the Scottish parliament who is returned for the constituency in which he lives, or whether he writes to, and sees, one of the regional representatives. The point is that regional representatives are also constituency representatives as well as those members who are returned in the first-past-the-post system. Both have constituencies. Nobody will somehow be returned to the Scottish parliament on some sort of national list or something like that. It is the difference between individual first-past-the-post constituencies and regional constituencies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   As always, the noble Lord puts his argument most persuasively. But there is another aspect. Are not the party managers the preponderant influence on who is returned in the region for regional votes? Does not that militate against the immediacy of the relationship of the member of the parliament and his constituents?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I think not. Nothing fundamentally changes. Parties have always brought their candidates to the electorate and allowed the electorate to make a <P>


<a name="column_1294"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1294</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decision. It is exactly the same in the case of the first-past-the-post candidates as it will be with people on the list. Parties bring their candidates to the electorate and the electorate makes a judgment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   Surely the noble Lord recognises the difference between what happens at present when the local party organisation chooses the candidate--albeit one proffered by the party--and one where the regional list is graduated according to how far the party managers favour the names on it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   It is up to the parties themselves to decide what procedures and processes they will use in selecting both their individual constituency candidates and those who will represent them on the party list. That is a matter for the parties, and rightly so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para9"></a>We want to ensure that the parliament we are establishing is inclusive and represents the diversity of Scotland. We believe that the electoral arrangements for the Scottish parliament will ensure a fairer balance of representation than would be achieved by reliance on a simple majority system. While the constituency seats will be contested in the traditional manner, the regional seats will be allocated on the basis of proportional representation but with a corrective element. Taken together, that should achieve a fairer distribution of seats and ensure that this is a parliament for all of Scotland representing a wide range of political persuasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para10"></a>I agree that the system for returning regional members can be seen as complex. But the actual voting process will be relatively straightforward for the voter. Each elector will be able to vote for a constituency candidate and cast a separate regional vote for the party or independent candidate they favour.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para11"></a>In the White Paper we promised that the electors would have two votes. Members of the Committee are seeking to remove those rights with the amendments before us. We have the opportunity to create a fair and representative parliament for Scotland and I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

If it makes up a little for yesterday, perhaps I may tell the Minister that he is the fourth Minister to defend this system to me over the Dispatch Box and he has made by far the best fist of it. He has not convinced me but he has made a far better job of it than his noble friends have done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-15_para12"></a>I shall not go over the arguments again. They have been gone over. We are coming to the question of the balance in different parts of Scotland, as the noble Lord, Lord Hughes of Woodside, mentioned. In my Amendments Nos. 8 and 9, I try to deal with that specifically. I was interested to have another joust with the noble Earl--I nearly called him my noble friend--Lord Russell. I must say to him that the Free Democrats in Germany are an interesting proposition. They just manage to struggle over the threshold of 5 per cent. on <P>


<a name="column_1295"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1295</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many occasions and yet, if one takes a tiny look at it, they have a lot more than 5 per cent. of the time in government in Germany, whether they have it with one party or another. I do not think that is particularly fair. They probably have more time in government than the two major parties because they switch allegiance. As to the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, who hopes that MSPs might spend less of their time on constituency matters, coming from the party that invented pavement politics, I thought that really did take the biscuit for this evening.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 15, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para0"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This is a small drafting amendment which seeks to remove from the Bill what I believe to be an unnecessary provision. At the outset, perhaps I may say with the sense of modesty which characterises members of the Mackay clan in your Lordships' House that this is not my own idea. The amendment is in identical terms to an amendment moved at Report stage on the Government of Wales Bill on 1st July by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, who I am happy to see is in his place this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para1"></a>Although the legal nature of the assembly for Wales is of a different character from that which the Scottish parliament will have, I believe that the same principle applies; namely, that the statute book should not include any provisions that are unnecessary and merely state the law as it would be. The amendment is focused on subsection (4) of Clause 1, which provides:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The validity of any proceedings of the Parliament is not affected by any vacancy in its membership". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para2"></a>When one considers the provisions of Clause 8(4) of the Bill, it is obvious that the Scottish parliament is intended to be able to function competently even though there is a vacancy among the constituency members. That subsection provides that a by-election to fill a constituency vacancy should not be held if the latest date for holding the poll would fall within the period of three months ending with the day on which the poll at the next ordinary general election would take place. It is clear from that provision that such a vacancy could exist for up to three months prior to a general election.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para3"></a>It is inconceivable that this Parliament would intend that the Scottish parliament would be powerless to act competently during such a three-month period. Indeed, I would go further. It is inconceivable that Parliament would intend that the Scottish parliament would be afflicted by some form of legal paralysis each and every time a vacancy in its membership might occur. It is equally inconceivable that any court would seriously entertain any such proposition. For those reasons, <P>


<a name="column_1296"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1296</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I move the amendment and I look forward to such support as I get for it from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   Without hesitation, I support the amendment. The subsection is utterly unnecessary and, being unnecessary, it should be removed. An unnecessary provision not only clogs up the statute book but is liable to give rise to undesirable arguments, sometimes very far-fetched.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para4"></a>When I moved a similar amendment to the Government of Wales Bill, I introduced it by describing to your Lordships, and with a statistical basis, how the statute book had swelled inexorably ever since the Renton Committee on the preparation of legislation had described it as already far too prolix. That being so, we should make every effort we can to remove unnecessary provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para5"></a>I take it--perhaps the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate will correct me if I am wrong--that this being a Westminster statute, it will fall to be construed by English law, although I cannot imagine that the law in Scotland is any different. By English law, I have no hesitation in saying that the provision is entirely unnecessary. If it were removed, exactly the same events would occur. If there were a vacancy, the parliament would still continue to operate, just as the House of Commons continues to operate, notwithstanding a by-election or the death of a Member, or your Lordships' House, for that matter, notwithstanding a disqualification of a Member or his absence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para6"></a>The only difference I can see from the Government of Wales Bill is that the Welsh assembly was specifically called a body corporate; in other words, a corporation aggregate. It is a fundamental feature of a corporation aggregate that a decision of the majority binds the whole body. That being so, a vacancy or absence of a member cannot make any difference. The majority decision binds.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para7"></a>So if this provision is unnecessary, I wholly support the amendment of the noble and learned Lord that we should remove it, and with thanks to have at least got rid of a few words from the over-prolix statute book.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I, too, support the amendment. I am very grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, for what he has said, although I feel obliged just to modify one of his arguments. He said that this would be interpreted under English law. With deep respect, I say to him that this is a Bill of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and would be interpreted according to the law of the United Kingdom, whatever that may be. If it were to be interpreted according to a law of Scotland, it would not worry me very much because I think that the Scottish courts are so wise that they would realise that the proceedings of the Scottish parliament could not possibly be held up merely because a by-election was pending.

<A NAME = "80708-16_para8"></a>Whichever view one takes with regard to the interpretation of this subsection, I would say that it is unnecessary. I am very glad that the amendment has been moved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   Perhaps I may indicate in one sentence that it gives me great pleasure on this occasion to indicate support from these Benches for the Mackay twins and their amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Advocate   (Lord Hardie): </B>  As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, said, this amendment is similar to the one tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, at Report stage in the Government of Wales Bill on 1st July. The report appears in Hansard at cols. 671 to 674.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para9"></a>Members of the Committee have suggested that this provision is unnecessary, as did the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale on the previous occasion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   Does the noble and learned Lord contest that, if this provision were removed, legally exactly the same situation would obtain?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I shall come to that. The short answer is: yes, I do contest that. Perhaps I may deal with the point that I was about to make. I share the desire of Members of the Committee for legislative economy, but do not agree that it would be appropriate to omit this provision on this occasion. As my noble and learned friend the Solicitor-General explained at Report stage in the Government of Wales Bill, and as Members of the Committee are aware, this provision has considerable precedent. I would not argue--and nor did my noble and learned friend the Solicitor-General--that we should include the provision simply because in the past we have always done so. However, I believe it is appropriate in this case to have the provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para10"></a>By omitting the provision on this occasion we would run a risk of giving someone the opportunity of challenging the parliament's actions by calling into question the validity of its actions because of a vacancy in its membership. That is particularly so, given that the argument to the effect that the provision is unnecessary, was, as I understand it, on the previous occasion based on the law of corporations aggregate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para11"></a>In this case the Scottish parliament is not declared to be a body corporate, as is the case in Clause 1(2) of the Government of Wales Bill. Indeed, Members of the Committee will see, in reference to the Bill, that it is clear that the parliament is not a body corporate because Clause 20 makes provision for a particular body corporate to act--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   If it is not a body corporate, is not the nearest analogy the House of Commons?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   As I was explaining, it is not a body corporate because Clause 20 specifically sets up a body <P>


<a name="column_1298"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1298</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>corporate entitled "The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body", which is obliged to carry out certain functions on behalf of the parliament. The corporate body comprises the presiding officer and four members of the parliament appointed in accordance with standing orders. One of the functions of the body corporate is to take proceedings by or on behalf of the parliament and to defend proceedings instituted against the parliament. It is my position that the parliament itself is an unincorporated body. It would be for the unincorporated association to regulate its own proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para12"></a>As regards this Bill, we are anxious to ensure that there is never any question of a challenge to the proceedings of the parliament by virtue of a vacancy arising. In answer to the point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, it is my understanding that the Westminster Parliament is a corporation sole.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   What does that mean?

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   The position appears to be that it is a parliament regulated by English law. In dealing with the question of the law which would apply to the interpretation of the legislation once it is enacted, I respectfully agree with the noble Lord, Lord Renton, that it would be interpreted in accordance with the law of that part of the United Kingdom where the issue was raised. If it were raised in Scotland, it would be determined in accordance with Scots law; if it were raised in England, it would be interpreted according to English law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-16_para13"></a>Clause 1(4) of the Bill puts the question of the validity of proceedings beyond any doubt, and that can be no bad thing. In those circumstances, I urge the noble Lord to withdraw this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, and the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Advocate sits down, I invite his attention to Schedule 2, which he has already mentioned. On page 60 paragraph 6(1) of the schedule states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The validity of any proceedings of the corporation shall not be affected by any vacancy among the members", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and I need not go any further.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para0"></a>If we accept that it is right to put the provision there, surely it becomes unnecessary to include it also in Clause 1(4). What is the point of a phrase being repeated twice in the same Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   Phrases are often repeated in the same Bill for different purposes, and that is the position here. In Schedule 2 one is dealing with the body corporate which is going to act on behalf of the parliament. Schedule 2, paragraph 6 relates to the proceedings of the corporation. So the validity of the proceedings of the <P>


<a name="column_1299"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1299</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>corporation cannot be challenged because one of its five members is not available--that is, the presiding officer or one of the four elected members.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The heading to Schedule 2 is, "Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body". Is that not the parliament itself?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   No. I have obviously been unclear in my explanation. Clause 20 sets up the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. Members of the Committee will find that on pages 9 and 10 of the Bill. Clause 20(1) states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There shall be a body corporate to be known as 'The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body'". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The members of that body in subsection (2) are,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(a) the Presiding Officer, and 
 (b) four members of the Parliament appointed in accordance with standing orders". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
If Members of the Committee read on to subsection (9), Schedule 2 is applied. Schedule 2 is related to that corporate body. We are talking about a vacancy which does not invalidate the actions of the corporate body, whereas Clause 1(4) relates to a vacancy in the parliament, which does not invalidate the actions of the parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord. He has got that point absolutely right, but it does not make Clause 1(4) in the least necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   In the end, the noble and learned Lord's case for Clause 1(4) was that it is there to prevent an argument arising. Does he really think that if the argument arose in England any court would possibly hold that a vacancy in the Scottish parliament invalidated the proceedings? Nor can I believe, unless the noble and learned Lord assures me to the contrary, that if the same question arose in Scotland any Scottish court could possibly hold that the vacancy impugned the validity of the proceedings of the parliament and that a by-election, for example, would render the parliament impotent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para1"></a>If the aim is to obviate an argument, there is almost no limit to what one can do. Every silly and futile argument, of which that is one, would have to be anticipated--and the statute book would continue to get more and more inflated. In the end, it comes down to this simple point: could any such argument possibly be maintained in any sensible court? The noble and learned Lord said that this provision has appeared in previous statutes. Ever since the earliest statutes, has any such argument even been put forward, much less been successful?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I am unable to answer the noble and learned Lord's last question as to whether such an <P>


<a name="column_1300"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1300</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>argument has ever been advanced in any case, just as my noble and learned friend the Solicitor-General was unable to answer a similar question--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   Perhaps I may put it more accurately. Have the Government any record of such an argument being advanced, still less of that argument being successful?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   The answer is the same. I am unable to give the noble and learned Lord an answer because I have no briefing to that effect. However, I shall of course undertake, as did my noble and learned friend the Solicitor-General, to write to the noble and learned Lord on this matter once the necessary research has been undertaken.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para2"></a>On the question of the risk of such an argument being upheld in the courts either in Scotland or in England, with respect to the noble and learned Lord, that is not the Government's initial concern. The Government are concerned lest a challenge be taken which would unnecessarily take up time and cause unnecessary anxiety. This provision which, as I have already said, is consistent with provisions in many previous statutes over the years puts the matter beyond any doubt.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the noble and learned Lord whether there is any record of anybody arguing that the House of Commons' proceedings are a nullity because a by-election is pending.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I am not aware of any such case but, in my respectful submission, that is not the point. I formally invite the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   If subsection (4) would stop this kind of legal argument taking place in the Scottish parliament, let us keep it in!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-17_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I hope that during the dinner hour the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, will seek to convince his noble friend that there are occasions for agreeing with "the Mackay twins", as he happily refers to us!
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para3"></a>This has been an interesting trailer to some important discussions that we shall have later in Committee about the relationship between the courts of the land-- I include not only the Scottish courts, but also the courts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland--and the legislation emanating from the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para4"></a>I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate for seeking to explain the Government's position in response to this amendment. I fully accept what the noble and learned Lord said about the legal nature of the Scottish parliament being different from that of the Welsh assembly. It is clear that it is not a "body corporate" as that term is used both in this Bill and in the Government of Wales Bill. I also agree that if this matter fell to be considered in the courts of Scotland, the law of Scotland would be applied. Whether there would be any difference between that law <P>


<a name="column_1301"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1301</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the law of England or the law that applies in Northern Ireland may be open to question. Undoubtedly, however, the law of Scotland would apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para5"></a>On corporations sole, I am not in a position to offer any further assistance other than to say that I understand that it is not a type of fish that my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish will be hoping to chase tomorrow!
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para6"></a>When the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, referred to this point on the Government of Wales Bill, he made it clear that this is not an issue on which it would be appropriate to seek to divide the House. However, he said that he hoped that the Government would reflect further on the discussions that had taken place. Echoing those words, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para7"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

(2) The referendum referred to in subsection (1) shall be held on such day as Her Majesty may, by Order in Council, appoint.

(3) The Secretary of State shall by order make such further provisions for the conduct of the referendum referred to in subsection (1) as he thinks appropriate.
<BR>
The power to make an order under this subsection shall be exercised by statutory instrument and any such statutory instrument shall be laid in draft before Parliament for approval by resolution of each House.
<BR>
(4) Regardless of the outcome of the referendum referred to in subsection (1), the Parliament shall not approve any resolution or otherwise make any decision to hold, or to call upon Her Majesty's Government to hold, any further such referendum for a period of ten years beginning with the day on which the referendum referred to in subsection (1) is held.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: I consider this to be a very important issue and it is one that I raised when we discussed the initial Scottish referendum. It relates to the question of independence. I feel strongly that we should have a referendum on independence because the parliament must work. I apologise; I know that I have already said this today, but I shall say it 100 times before we finish this Bill. We must give the Scottish parliament some strength. It would be a very bad thing if the parliament were to have hanging over its head the sword of Damocles of the SNP wanting independence if it gains control.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para11"></a>There has been a great deal of media interest already in this amendment. Scot FM has already been on to me, as have several newspapers. We must discuss this issue fully. I feel strongly that SNP voters do not necessarily want independence. The majority of SNP voters are young, nationalistic (with a lower case "n") and very proud of being Scots. So am I--I may talk with an English accent, but I am a Scot through and through and am very proud of that. Tactical voting has been used to <P>


<a name="column_1302"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a tremendous extent in Scotland and, very undemocratically and very sadly in my opinion, it has cleared the Scottish Conservative Party out of Scotland. I do not think that those voters will appreciate the Government's stance yesterday on student fees. That was playing into the hands of the nationalists. We must be very careful about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para12"></a>On Monday 6th June, the Glasgow Herald had the huge headline,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"SNP set to be largest party at Holyrood". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
On the following day, Tuesday, it produced a map which was SNP yellow all over. We know that opinion polls are dodgy things, especially when we are close to an election. However, according to the Glasgow Herald, once all the voting has taken place in all the areas and regions, the SNP will have 56 seats; the Labour Party will have 46; the Liberal Democrats will have 15 and the Conservatives will have 12 seats. If that is true, it means that the SNP will have the greatest number of seats.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para13"></a>The SNP has always declared that it will use the Scottish parliament to try to gain independence. That is its raison d'etre. It has been trying to make Scotland an independent country. We must not be frightened of the SNP; we must tackle it head on. Many people have said to me that to hold an independence referendum is playing into its hands. I do not believe so. It would be a great pity if this opportunity were not taken. It is also an enormous pity that there is not a Scottish nationalist Peer in this Chamber who can stand up and put that case. Instead of considering a knighthood for Sean Connery perhaps he should have been offered an earldom so that he could sit here prognosticating on the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para14"></a>But the people of Scotland need to be shown how the parliament can work within the United Kingdom. They voted for a particular parliament--a Scottish parliament. However, only 60 per cent. of Scots voted, which means that 40 per cent. did not vote for one reason or another. Of those who voted, a huge majority, 74 per cent., voted for the parliament. However, of the total Scottish population only 45 per cent. voted for a parliament and in Britain only 4 per cent. did so. Therefore, 96 per cent. of the British public did not want a Scottish parliament. We must make this parliament work for the 74 per cent. who bothered to leave their houses and vote for it. If in a referendum there is no call for independence that vote will give the parliament the impetus to succeed. It will remove the spectre of independence for at least 10 years. The parliament can then bed in and prove itself and show the Scottish people that it can work and do everything that the Government and I want it to do. That can be done from within the United Kingdom. If I am wrong and the Scottish people want independence we will still be sorting out what type of parliament should be established, but the arrangements for the reserved powers will be a complete waste of time because they will not be necessary. We cannot put our heads in the sand and forget about it. The spectre of nationalism will not go away; it is growing. We must make quite certain that the Scottish parliament can work. I beg to move.

<A NAME="80708-17_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Rowallan, has tabled an amendment that will strike a chord with many citizens of the kingdom of Scotland. He has grasped the issue of the moment; the question of self-government for Scotland. The referendum held on 11th September last year established that Scotland was a political entity. The widely drawn question about the establishment of the Scottish parliament asked about self-government and did not refer to the limited self-government proposed in the White Paper and now in the Bill. For many, the problem to be addressed is: why can the people of Scotland be overruled by a majority from elsewhere who may have different objectives? Clearly, this is the Westminster question. The Bill answers that question in part for Scotland because Scottish domestic legislation is to be devolved, but the very significant reserved powers keep the Westminster question on the table.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para15"></a>To be in a union must be purposeful. That is true of the British Union, especially if it is not a de facto annexation. Scots may well have to decide between Britain and Europe. The Union of the Crowns in 1603 brought chaos to Scotland's European trading pattern and cultural exchange. Being ensnared in Great Britain has made very difficult the re-establishment of those links with Europe. The reaction of England to Europe fills me with gloom. Scotland is supposed to be a European country.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para16"></a>There is a demographic issue to be resolved; the question of being Scottish or British. The combined sense of Britishness and Scottishness is strongest among those with life experience of the Second World War. Those born subsequently may have increasingly less strong identification with that sense. What is sought generally is political rather than national autonomy. There is a paradoxical demand to be Scottish politically and to retain British links, especially as we all have friends and relations either side of the Border, not to mention trading patterns.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-17_para17"></a>It has been said that Scotland should put up with the pain of disaggregation and any interim budget reductions as a long-term investment that will be worth it. The demand for political autonomy can be non-seccesionist. It ends only the parliamentary union. Such a position gives the Crown a linchpin role as the cement in a social, linguistic and economic union. This amendment allows the people of Scotland to test their real desire for political autonomy both now and in 10 years' time, if necessary building on the useful experience of the devolution project. I support the amendment.

Having had the great pleasure of sharing an aeroplane journey from Scotland with the noble Lord, Lord Rowallan, I am well aware of the sentiments behind his amendment and have a great deal of sympathy for them. In particular, I should very much like to see the Scottish parliament placing a hiatus <P>


<a name="column_1304"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>between any referendums that are held on the issue of independence. We do not want to return to this business every year, as tends to happen in Quebec. Where I disagree with the noble Lord is that I believe that this is another issue where the initiative must come from the Scottish parliament. If it comes from Westminster it runs the risk of being misinterpreted. I do not want to become obsessed by appearances, but there is a very great danger that nationalists may portray the amendment of the noble Lord as one that places an unnecessary hurdle between Scots and their ultimate desire for independence. I can see the argument that will be made: "Vote now or you will not have another chance for 10 years". That will be used as a positive argument for independence.

<A NAME="80708-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   Does the noble Lord accept that if there is no referendum the parliament will have a sword of Damocles suspended over it for 10 years and it will not have a chance to get going because of that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   I believe that the Scottish people will become rather impatient with anyone who holds up the provision of better education, health and transport in Scotland by constantly holding out the prospect of a Scottish referendum. I believe that that would be counter-productive from the viewpoint of the SNP. The essence of this parliament is to get it working as well as possible. I believe that very quickly people will realise that what the Scottish parliament is about is not gesture politics but the real business of making the day-to-day life of Scots a better one. The parties who contribute to that will succeed at the second elections and the parties who do not will fail. I have great confidence that the experience of the Scottish parliament will prove to be a good one from that viewpoint. I cannot side with the noble Lord because the outcome of his amendment may be precisely the reverse of what he intends.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Linklater of Butterstone: </B>   I, too, rise to oppose the amendment. I understand the motive and intention behind it and have heard the argument put by both Labour and Tory supporters in Scotland. I believe that the argument is misplaced and that the amendment is both unnecessary and undesirable. It is unnecessary because a referendum on the constitution has already been held on the basis of the White Paper. The Scots delivered their view unequivocally in favour of a devolved parliament within the Union. In the previous year, they also had the opportunity to vote for the SNP and an independent Scotland. They conspicuously failed to vote for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para0"></a>I believe that to introduce a further referendum simply on the basis of mid-term opinion polls is to undermine the constitutional process. It is like saying, "Do you really mean it?" On that basis, when would you ever stop?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para1"></a>I believe all Scottish people want a period of calm, and that is what the new Scottish parliament will need. A period of calm and stability will enable it to settle down to its new existence.

<A NAME = "80708-18_para2"></a>As Jim Wallace said, pulling up the newly planted tree is one sure way of killing the tree if you want to examine its roots. The duty of politicians will be to get on with the business of running Scottish domestic affairs and address issues that really concern people, for example, education, health and employment. Everything will be new and all concerned will be learning as they go on. The eyes of the UK and the world will be on the new parliament to see how it handles its task. The last thing that the country needs at that moment is the prospect of yet another referendum hanging over it which would in any event solve nothing. In Quebec, where there have been repeated referenda on independence, the economy has been seriously undermined. Uncertainty, as we all know, is the enemy of a stable economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para3"></a>The time to judge the parliament will be after it has had time to prove itself and has demonstrated how well it is meeting the needs of the Scottish people. Imagine if a referendum did take place. What would the Scots be voting on? The SNP policies have never been properly challenged and tested, certainly not in a parliamentary forum. What does independence really mean? My belief is that it is not very much more than a slogan, and at the very least a period of debate and analysis, and the challenge of what the SNP stands for within the context of a properly established parliament will go some way to determining the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para4"></a>If another referendum was held before the Scottish parliament was established, people would not be voting on the pure constitutional issue of independence: they would use the occasion to express an opinion on new Labour, on Tony Blair, on Donald Dewar's ineffectiveness, on local government mismanagement, on Sean Connery's knighthood and a whole raft of issues which have nothing whatever to do with independence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para5"></a>As I stated in my speech at Second Reading, I believe that the surge in support for the SNP has everything to do with Scottish dissatisfaction with new Labour and not a lot to do with nationalism and separatism. I do not believe that there has been a sudden surge of belief in this philosophy and those principles. Anecdotal evidence has been referred to showing that most people who say they would vote for the SNP actually want what they are getting through the Bill, a devolved Scottish parliament responsible for its own domestic affairs within the framework of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para6"></a>We have a duty to put that to the test first. Referenda are blunt instruments and should only be used very sparingly to test major constitutional issues, above all in a parliamentary democracy like ours where the ballot box is the way people express their views. There is always the possibility that the result will be inconclusive and then nothing will be gained and much damage could be done. We have held a referendum and we have been given the answer. In the next general election the Scots will once again have the chance to express their views on the basis of how the parliament has performed, which is the right and proper way for them to do so.

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1306</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discussion has been held in some depth here and in another place and it has been rejected. We have moved forward. The forthcoming months will see the issue coming to the fore. Every major political party has an opportunity to put the argument to the Scottish people on the benefits of voting for the parties that are concerned and, one hopes, to diminish the vote of the SNP. I believe this will be won on the hustings and not through a referendum, which, by the nature of its format, is limited in its questions.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Watson of Invergowrie: </B>   My Lords, I also oppose the amendment, although for reasons slightly different from those so far advanced. The question as to whether or not there should be a referendum on independence and at what time is very interesting. I do not share the views of the noble Lord, Lord Rowallan, that the amendment would remove a sword of Damocles hanging over the parliament for years on end. It may be his aim equally to shoot the SNP fox by holding a referendum, whereby independence would be beaten and sent scurrying into the woods never to reappear. The latter part of that proposition is quite wrong. The question of independence will never disappear from Scotland; nor should it while 25 per cent. of the people believe in voting for a party that advocates independence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para7"></a>However, it is also dangerous to argue that the level of support enjoyed by the Scottish National Party at the moment is not an entirely accurate reflection of the people wanting independence. To argue that point one would equally have to argue that the positions of the parties of the noble Lord or the noble Baroness in the opinion polls were similarly suspect, and indeed that of my own party. That argument does not stand up to scrutiny. There is always an element of protest in mid term or in opinion polls between elections. It should not be assumed that people who vote for the SNP are always doing so as a protest; that would be dangerous and would signify complacency, which I would not wish to endorse.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para8"></a>The issue of whether or not there should be a referendum exercised Members in another place at Report stage and Third Reading. There were many exchanges on the subject of whether or not the Scottish parliament could initiate a referendum. Perhaps the Lord Advocate can confirm the position. My reading of paragraph 1(b) of Part 1 of Schedule 5 on the Union between Scotland and England is that it would be impossible, it being a reserved power, to make a change via the Scottish parliament, and the Scottish parliament could not therefore initiate the referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para9"></a>The position could become very difficult if sufficient numbers of people living in Scotland voted for the Scottish National Party and gave it a minimum of 65 seats in the parliament. If the SNP then decided to use what would be a majority in that parliament to decide that there should be a referendum on independence, it could provoke a constitutional crisis. It would be interesting to consider how that situation could be avoided. As the noble Lord, Lord Rowallan said, the most recent opinion poll projected a SNP representation <P>


<a name="column_1307"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1307</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of 63 seats, which is not very far from a majority. It would be a very difficult position and would cause real and dangerous friction between the parliament in Holyrood and Parliament here if the majority of the SNP decided to push for an independence referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para10"></a>When faced with the choice, I believe it unlikely that the majority of Scots would vote for independence. I would argue against it. However, I repeat the view I expressed at Second Reading. I would respect the views of a majority of Scots and people living in Scotland voting in a referendum if that is what they wanted. I firmly believe that that is what they should have, not because I do or do not believe in it but because it is democracy. We should not remove that basic right from the people of Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-18_para11"></a>I oppose the amendment because it would delay the implementation of the parliament. It is not appropriate that we should decide at this stage whether or not there should be a referendum. I do not think there should be a block of 10 years put on until a subsequent referendum is held. For those reasons I oppose the amendment, but this very important issue will not go away and should be clarified. I repeat my request to my noble friend to clarify the position.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, I am fairly convinced that after the first Scottish parliamentary elections the Scottish Nationalists will probably be the biggest party in the Scottish parliament and that possibly after the following election they will have an overall majority. I know the Government do not like it but they have to face the fact.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para0"></a>Would it not be possible to have a referendum now, organised by the Westminster Parliament, with the Westminster Parliament deciding on the questions to be asked rather than one later, organised by the Scottish Nationalists, with them deciding on the questions to be asked, bearing in mind that those questions will be designed carefully to get the answer that they want?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para1"></a>As one who, I am afraid, regards it as inevitable that Scotland will become independent, probably within the next five or six years, I wonder, first, whether we are not wasting our time taking this Bill through this place. Would we not be better just to let it go through as it stands, since the future seems to me to be inevitable?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para2"></a>If we had a referendum now, and the result was in favour of independence, Scotland might be saved the expense of building a perfectly frightful and perfectly hideous parliament building, possibly totally unsuited to its requirement, because I suspect strongly that the Scottish Nationalists would start off in the old high school and then decide later that they required a new parliament building.

<A NAME="80708-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   This has been a short and interesting debate. If the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, thinks that the constitutional issue was settled in the referendum last autumn, she did not see the same ballot paper as I did, because it did not put the three options. On 17th June--I would quote my words if it would not take time--I said that it would be an <P>


<a name="column_1308"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1308</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unsettled referendum, because it was not asking all the questions. I prayed in aid no less than the current Secretary of State who said in the Daily Telegraph of 13th April that year that the party's 49 Scottish MPs would campaign for a multi-option referendum on the country's political future. They did not do that. They joined, as the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, pointed out this afternoon--foolishly in his view and in mine--with the SNP.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para3"></a>I suggested to the Government last summer that to campaign with the SNP was dangerous. The Secretary of State was saying, "Vote for devolution and you save the Union" and Alex Salmond was saying, "Vote for devolution as the first step to independence". From looking at any public opinion poll, if I were to go to the bookmakers I would be putting my money on Alex Salmond. It is not just one or two opinion polls, but a serious number of them. As recently as last week the Scotsman showed 56 per cent. of my fellow countrymen for independence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para4"></a>A good reason for not having a referendum, given the Government's incompetence on this issue, is that they would not be able to hold the line. George Robertson gave us the defence review earlier today. I hope that he is a better Defence Secretary than prophet. He said that devolution would kill the nationalists stone dead. Stone dead? With 56 per cent. voting for independence and 48 per cent. voting for the SNP in the latest opinion poll, some stone! Some dead! I say to my noble friend that we will need to do a bit more campaigning before we risk a referendum on the future of the UK.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Rowallan, will not be surprised to hear that the Government do not support the amendment which would require the Secretary of State to hold a referendum on independence before the parliament could meet and would prevent the parliament from requesting another referendum for a decade.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para5"></a>The noble Lord believes we need to seek the views of the people of Scotland on independence before we can allow the parliament to meet. I could not disagree more. The task we have in government, and I would say in this place, is to deliver the Scottish parliament for which the Scottish people so overwhelmingly voted last September. We cannot allow ourselves to be distracted by fluctuations in opinion polls, however exciting they might be, from meeting the commitment to establish a functioning Scottish parliament as soon as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para6"></a>For more years than I care to remember there has been feverish press speculation on what the people of Scotland wanted, or did not want, by way of self-government. To formulate views on the future governance of Scotland, the Scottish Constitutional Convention was established in 1989 to draw together a wide range of interests, not just the political parties, to try to reach agreement on a way forward which would secure a broad basis of support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para7"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, and my noble friend Lord Ewing explained in great detail, from their first-hand experience, the painstaking work of the convention over the years produced a proposal which <P>


<a name="column_1309"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1309</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was set out in Scotland's Parliament, Scotland's Right, presented in 1995. That proposal underpinned the Government's White Paper. It is upon that foundation that the Bill builds.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para8"></a>I can see no reason for this amendment. The people of Scotland have made their views very clear. They voted overwhelmingly in favour of parties supporting the Union at the general election. Out of a possible 72, they returned 66 Members of Parliament in Scotland from parties which were committed to implementing the Scottish Constitutional Convention's proposals. For our part the Government subsequently put our devolution proposals to the people of Scotland in the White Paper, Scotland's Parliament, and received a resounding endorsement of those proposals in the referendum last September. This Bill gives effect to those proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para9"></a>The noble Lord's amendment would simply delay giving effect to those proposals with another round of quite unnecessary consultation, as my noble friends Lord Gordon and Lord Watson said. The noble Lord, Lord Rowallan, seems to argue that the Scots were not given the opportunity to vote on independence. I disagree. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, and disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. The general election gave them that opportunity, and those advocating independence at that general election were unable to secure the necessary support of the Scottish electorate. The Scottish electorate had an opportunity to vote for the SNP and did not take it; they rejected it. The people of Scotland have made their views clear, and it is time that their expectations were met.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para10"></a>My noble friend Lord Watson asked about a referendum. It is my understanding that it is not for the Scottish parliament to legislate to hold a referendum. That will be dealt with in more detail when we come to Schedule 5. The referendum last September followed years of detailed preparation and consensus-building across a broad range of Scottish opinion. The Scottish people have endorsed overwhelmingly the concept of a Scottish parliament as proposed by the Government in the White Paper and established in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para11"></a>We do not need yet another referendum. We need to deliver on what the Scottish people have the right to expect: a devolved parliament within the framework of the UK. That is what the Bill delivers. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, she said that the people of Scotland voted resoundingly in the general election for the present Government. That is true but we have always been told that a week is a long time in politics. That general election was over 60 weeks ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I said that the people of Scotland voted overwhelmingly--66 members out of a possible 72--for the parties which campaigned for the proposals put forward by the Scottish Constitutional Convention. I do not share the noble Lady's gloomy view about the future of politics in Scotland.

<P>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1310</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay of Cartvale, had to answer for the Government. It seems that whenever I put up anything she is always there. However, I welcome her comments. If the noble Lord, Lord Watson, reads Amendment No. 174 in my name, he will find that we are discussing the point that he raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para12"></a>I appreciate the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater of Butterstone. I think that I can call her my kinsman. Whether or not we are kinsmen, we are both related to the noble Earl, Lord Glasgow. Her points were apposite and correct. I agree with her in almost every case.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para13"></a>I put forward the amendment not because I was frightened of the rise of the SNP or of opinion polls, but because I want to see this parliament succeed and work well. I want to prove to the Scottish people that it can work well without having the independence issue continually raised by a rampant SNP.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para14"></a>The arguments have been strong from all sides of the Chamber. It is appropriate that I read Hansard, consider the matter further and perhaps return to it at Report stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "80708-19_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, for some hours your Lordships have been considering the affairs of North Britain. I now invite those noble Lords who find the attractions of this House greater than those of the dining room or television set to turn their attentions to the North of England, in particular the North West.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para19"></a>Before outlining the substance of my case, I invite the House to cast its mind back to the beginning of the last century. In that century, one of the greatest British contributions to the historic process of the industrial revolution was the development of the railways. We were a pioneer. While individual railway developments began in the North of England, the rail system in this country has been London centred. One has only to look at a pictogram of the existing rail system in this country to note that every spoke in the wheel centres on London and comes to the great termini of Paddington, Euston, St. Pancras, King's Cross, Waterloo and Victoria. That pattern suited our country in the 19th and 20th centuries, but it is a structure which is inherently unsuited for the next century.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para20"></a>We are moving into a world of vastly improved communications and mobility, with direct access to the Continent via the Channel Tunnel. We are part of the European Union single market. No longer is a railway system modelled on the hub and wheel appropriate for a rail or road system for the next millennium.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para21"></a>The European Commission's diagram of its identified trans-European road and rail networks demonstrates a different pattern. Instead of the hub and wheel model, there are intricate spider's webs of routes. Instead of being at the centre, the termini are at the extremities of the system. In the context of the single market, that development has serious implications for this country, and in particular the regions, not least the North West of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para22"></a>If one considers, for example, the road network for London and the North West of England, it is possible to travel south. But it is also possible to go round the capital on the M.25. Those who travel on the M.25 know that on occasions it can be singularly congested. But it is a vast improvement on the North and South Circular roads. The problem is that we have not constructed an M.25 for the trains. Those who wish to travel round London on a railway have to use the rail equivalent of the North and South Circular roads, with all that that entails.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para23"></a>I wish now to look specifically at the North West of England. Those in business, with relatively deep pockets, will use the aeroplane. I gather that it is a rule of thumb that for any journey of more than about four hours the businessman will use the aeroplane because time is valuable to him. In the North West at Manchester we have the seventh busiest airport in Europe, and the premier airport in this country after London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para24"></a>I have already touched on road transport. There is good access to the South of England down the M.6. It is possible to go round the metropolis on the M.25 and down to the Channel Tunnel on the M.20. The real problem relates to the rail system. The West Coast Main Line takes one down to London, but while it is possible either to go round or through London, for the ordinary passenger the experience is unsatisfactory. It will either be slow or the traveller from the North who wishes to go to the Eurostar terminal at Waterloo will have to take an expensive taxi. Alternatively--it is difficult for the old, the very young or the infirm--travellers have to struggle with their baggage through the London Underground system. Those of us who use that system know that it is one of the least attractive characteristics of our city.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para25"></a>That is not good enough for the next millennium. What should we be aiming for? As I have indicated, I do not believe that the business traveller will be the principal beneficiary of improved rail links between the North West, the Channel Tunnel, and beyond. It is more important for those whom I might describe as being less pressured by time. I refer to pensioners who wish to travel, students who wish to go abroad, and tourists. The argument applies not only to people from the North West who wish to travel to the South, but to those coming from the Continent. The system is not helpful <P>


<a name="column_1312"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1312</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to those who wish to come and spend their money and to enjoy the many attractions which tourism offers in this part of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para26"></a>Only two nights ago, in a debate instigated by the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, the point was made that tourism is one of the most important industries in the North West of England. It is an industry which offers some of the best prospects for jobs. In addition, where "just in time" delivery is increasingly important for commerce, it is of the greatest importance that the rail freight network is able to deliver goods in a timely and speedy manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para27"></a>Against that background, the arrangements for rail traffic to travel round London from the North are vastly inadequate. The system poses not only the physical problems but a psychological problem. Noble Lords know--none better than the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington--of the efforts being made in the North West of England to attract inward investment. That inward investment is important to the economy of that part of the country. Some of the best examples of American investment in this country were triggered because we in Britain are part of the single market. Yet efforts to encourage inward investment are hampered by the fact that the rail and road links are not as good as they should be. It may be merely a psychological point; but such a psychological point is significant in the minds of those who spend large sums of other people's money encouraging businesses into those parts of the country where they are badly needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para28"></a>Against that background, what do I believe should be done? As noble Lords know, Virgin relatively recently took over services on the West Coast Main Line. I am a regular user of that line. I have experienced both good and bad aspects of it. I do not hold any brief for Virgin. However, as your Lordships may know, Virgin proposed that it should be allowed to run certain Eurostar services linking in with the West Coast Main Line. It is no part of my case today specifically to promote the Virgin proposal--partly because I believe that there are serious shortcomings in the proposed coverage as regards the North West. Noble Lords may think that I am bound to say that because that is where I live. Equally, the arrangement of having to change at Watford, which I gather is inherent within it, is itself unsatisfactory.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para29"></a>However, what I should like to hear from the Minister in her remarks later this evening is that she supports the idea that there should be proper Eurostar services from the North to the Continent and that they should serve the whole of the North and there should be no discrimination in the form that they take. Whoever was to run the service, it would be both an actual and a psychological benefit for the North West of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para30"></a>I do not believe that there can be many in this House who feel that this country has covered itself in glory in the way in which it has dealt with the problems posed by the Channel Tunnel London link. Too often we see that link simply in terms of London, the Channel and Europe. But as I hope I have explained already, that is a crucial artery serving the whole of the rail communications network for the rest of the country.

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1313</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para31"></a>I am extremely concerned that that further aspect of the link is not being given the proper priority that it should in the Government's thinking. I merely point out that I raised that point on 3rd June when the noble Baroness repeated the Statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister in another place. In particular, a crucial aspect of the proposals for the infrastructure necessary to get the Channel Tunnel rail link to Stratford is that insufficient attention has been paid to what in my view is the overriding need for the creation of a proper link between the track in and around St. Pancras to that running from Euston, serving the West Midlands and the North West of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para32"></a>It should be an integral part of the proposals for the Stratford to St. Pancras link that a proper spur is put in place to become available for use simultaneously with the very link itself. That should be incorporated as an integral part of phase 2. That would send out a clear message to all concerned and interested in this matter that when that link is built in the year 2007, that spur will be included.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para33"></a>This matter unites people from all political persuasions right across the North West of England. There is an impression that the Government in London do not fully understand and appreciate the concerns of the North West. The reason that I have tabled the Question this evening is to draw it to the Government's attention and to urge them to come out saying emphatically that indeed it is desirable that there should be direct Eurostar services for the North West and that when the Stratford-St. Pancras link is built, that will include a proper spur onto the West Coast Main Line.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Cadman: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Inglewood and congratulate him on asking this Question this evening. As a former member of the Select Committee on the CTRL Bill, now enacted, I share his concern that the recent financial problems experienced by London and Continental Railways should result in some delay or even lack of a commitment to complete the link as provided in the Act and the subsequent inability of the North West to benefit from the enhanced transport possibilities that will surely follow.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para34"></a>One of the key features of the CTRL Act was that services from Europe via the Channel Tunnel would be able to serve all parts of the United Kingdom and not just London. Indeed, subsequent to the passing of the Act, London and Continental Railways promoted a transport and works order to provide powers for an international station at Stratford in East London and a connection across the King's Cross railway lines to enable services to access the West Coast Main Line and proceed north without having to enter St. Pancras on their journey to the North West and Scotland. The North East of England would be served via St. Pancras and the connection thence to the East Coast Main Line, already provided for in the Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para35"></a>The trains for those services are built and their safety cases are well on the way to being achieved. There is no reason why those north of London services cannot start quite shortly, and I should like to say a few words about the regime under which they will operate.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para36"></a>We seem to be rather frightened of international trains. However, they have been rambling about Europe now for many years and passengers are used to them, and indeed are encouraged, to make use of services that pass through several countries before they reach their final destination. In many cases, customs and immigration procedures, where necessary, are carried out on the trains themselves and passengers are put to the minimum of inconvenience.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para37"></a>I hope that that procedure will be adopted for those north of London Eurostar services. After all, there will be plenty of time for customs and immigration to carry out their procedures between, let us say, Lille and London. Anyone found without the right papers can be taken off the train at its first stop in the UK, which will most probably be somewhere in or near London. Let us remember that UK departing passengers are a matter for the French authorities, and they seem to have no problem with on-board immigration procedures. I am quite sure that a suitable scheme along those lines can be implemented to enable the service to be attractive to intending passengers and for our immigration procedures to be catered for adequately.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para38"></a>Indeed, there really is no reason why those trains cannot carry domestic passengers for appropriate parts of their journeys within the UK. That would considerably increase the economic viability of the service, especially as their comfort and superior image could well attract a premium fare.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para39"></a>That practice is very common in Europe where high-quality international services in many countries carry domestic passengers, often at a supplementary fare. Indeed, in France, passengers for Brussels and Paris are regularly booked onto Eurostar at Lille, both originating on and changing from regional TGV services. SNCF regards Eurostar as simply an addition to its TGV network, as it does the recently introduced PKBA Thalys trains which connect Paris with Koln and Amsterdam via Brussels. Reservations on those services are all handled by the same system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para40"></a>I hope that the Minister can provide some assurance that any scheme which is envisaged will not be so expensive that the north of London service is made unviable. From a practical point of view, the proposed exclusion of passengers from the platforms at which Eurostars will call at provincial stations here is bound to cause operating problems in itself. What happens if the Eurostar is delayed for some reason and a domestic service has to precede it? Are domestic passengers to be herded about the station just to make sure that they are not around when the Eurostar appears?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para41"></a>I very much hope that those north of London services can be started as soon as possible. It is most encouraging that Virgin Trains has made an offer to operate those services without public subsidy and under whatever regime Her Majesty's Government might deem to be necessary, although I trust that some thought may be given to my earlier remarks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para42"></a>It is a start and should go a long way to ensure that the CTRL is completed in its entirety. Without that commitment, the project which we all worked so hard to achieve a couple of years ago will surely not deliver <P>

<A NAME="80708-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mountevans: </B>   My Lords, it is ironic that during the winter sports season recently finished, Eurostars run to Bourg-St. Maurice, deep in the French Alps. This summer there were plans to run them to the venues where England and Scotland played their World Cup games, although those plans came to nought.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para43"></a>The irony in that lies in the fact that so far, Eurostars have never, on this side of the Channel, taken passengers beyond Waterloo. My noble friend Lord Inglewood has addressed that irony by raising his Question and I am grateful for that. I should like to leave it to the noble Baroness who is to reply to confirm that a proposal exists to link Stratford to the West Coast Main Line, subject to a transport and works order.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para44"></a>In wider terms, we know that demand for high-speed long-distance rail travel is growing on the Continent. The French TGV began by running from Paris to Lyons and it fairly quickly drove Air Inter more or less off the route. The TGV now goes to the Mediterranean coast, the Alps, Switzerland and Turin. Its cousin Thalys links Paris with Amsterdam and Cologne and perhaps, in two years time, it will reach Berlin.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para45"></a>Demand exists on the Continent. I am absolutely certain that that demand exists just as strongly north of London, be it East or West Coast. One must be concerned that earlier efforts to link the regions with Eurostar via Waterloo were virtually unsuccessful, with some of the very few trains that ran each day carrying perhaps only ten passengers. I wonder whether that reflected lack of demand, lack of convenience--because, perhaps, there was only one train a day--or lack of choice, again because there was only one train a day; or, indeed, lack of opportunities, also because there was only one train a day.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para46"></a>I hope that it was the latter three, and that the review commissioned by the right honourable Deputy Prime Minister, and due to be available by December, will establish both demand in the regions and the viability of meeting that demand. If that cannot be done, the seven train sets concerned should be released for other projects, provided that they satisfy the relevant safety cases. Perhaps the Minister can update us on those safety cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para47"></a>Given demand and safety, for me the issues come down to two--or really only one and a half because the first leads to the other. First, we must decide how best to proceed as of, say, 1999, using existing infrastructure which is almost all in place thanks--believe it or not--to a previous generation of privatised railways. Secondly, we must decide how to proceed when the Ashford to St. Pancras works are completed. I am sure that we all assume rather than just hope that they will be completed. The first of these, if it can be solved, <P>


<a name="column_1316"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1316</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would, I suggest, solve the second because the latter would inherit--and, indeed, improve upon--a going concern.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para48"></a>As far as I understand it, as of now the solution lies in the hands of the British Airways/National Bus/French and Belgian Railway consortium, which has been offered the contract to run the "beyond London trains", if we can call them that; this always depending on the various regulatory bodies allowing that consortium to go ahead as the train operating company.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para49"></a>There is also a proposal from Virgin on the table, which has already been mentioned. However, as far as I can gather, it is only a proposal. There has been no discussion between the consortium and Virgin at present on the offer. Virgin's proposal, with its strong emphasis on freedom from public subsidy, is very welcome as indeed are the service proposals--certainly, I should have thought, to my noble friend Lord Inglewood: daily from Edinburgh and Glasgow, twice daily from Manchester and Birmingham and five times daily from Watford. I realise that there is a Manchester to Glasgow gap, but I am sure that it will sort itself out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para50"></a>However, there would be some very serious problems despite this proposed running without public funding. I say that because if one looks at Glasgow Central and at one of its more remote platforms, one will see a beautiful glass building that has been there for four or five years. I got to know it when I was the chairman of a British Rail station judging panel. It is obviously the Eurostar facility. That would have to be repeated at all points where Eurostar services from the regions stopped. It would include security and checking and, understandably, Customs and immigration control. All of these are costs which will initially be paid by Eurostar, but which will eventually flow through to the passenger. I assume that every station would have to have all these facilities, because we already know that passenger loadings on Paris services presently justify on-board immigration and Customs controls, but Brussels loadings do not. But, after all, Brussels is now receiving up to 12 trains a day from Waterloo, whereas here we are only talking about five or six.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para51"></a>I feel, therefore, that the latter situation must prevail on the regional services. To eliminate the problem, would it not be better--and here I disagree with my noble friend--to focus on Watford where all Virgin West Coast services will eventually call, and concentrate all security and frontier matters there? A change of train would still be required, but the volume of travel choices--the sheer volume of Virgin's West Coast mainline services converging on Watford and the opportunities to run more trains from Watford round London through the tunnel--and the number of opportunities would still be much greater than that offered by Virgin's proposals in terms of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para52"></a>I appreciate that Watford International would penalise the East Coast main line, but I believe that the East Coast is pro tem until we get St. Pancras better served via Kings Cross and London Transport to Waterloo, which is surely quicker than Peterborough and then a meander around northern London. Whatever approach <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>one were to adopt, I hope that we would not allow ourselves to be diverted in this instance by projects involving Heathrow.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para53"></a>To sum up, I must say that I welcome my noble friend's Question and his wish to see the North West enjoy its share of the benefits of the Channel Tunnel rail link. If demand is there, and it can be viably met, we should set out, and set out quickly, to meet it. My own proposal to do this I shall call a variant of Virgin's proposal--matching the best of its West Coast Main Line project with the simplest of interchanges: Watford International.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-19_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, for tabling this Question. Clearly the question of international rail services north of London is an important one. I hope the noble Lord will not mind if, in considering the matter, I link with the North West, Yorkshire and Humberside, and the North East because it seems to me that many of the same arguments apply. Clearly the establishment of such links north of London starts off with a very strong transport policy justification, both in terms of passengers and freight to the extent that such links can be established and successfully reduce pressure on other parts of the transport network.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para54"></a>However, it seems to me that there are two other principal reasons for wishing to see quick progress being made on such links--one is economic and the other is political. The economic argument relates to the regeneration of the North West and equally Yorkshire, Humberside and the North. We have seen a tremendous economic change there over the past 30 years. Many of the industries which made their names in those areas have in effect gone into reverse. Whether it is textiles and engineering in the North West, or steel and coal in the North East, the industries on which the populations of those regions have depended for their wealth have simply shrivelled to a fraction of their former size and, in some cases, have disappeared altogether.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para55"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, said, there has been a significant amount of success in new industry in those regions, especially in service industries. The noble Lord mentioned tourism which has indeed been a great success story. However, if they are to compete as successful regions within Europe, it seems to me that they must have and be seen to have the very best of transport links. Rail must play a part in that improved transport mix.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para56"></a>If we look, for example, to the North West, it will be seen that its regeneration plans assume better rail services than currently exist. Indeed, when one looks at the growth points that have been established in somewhere like Trafford Park, such developments only make sense as growth points if they have first-class rail services--in that case, principally freight services. As the noble Lord said, the current service from the North West to Europe via the north and south circulars of the British Rail system are simply not adequate for the future.
<P>


<a name="column_1318"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1318</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para57"></a>As regards the North, I suspect that the biggest economic gains from improved international rail links are likely to be derived from freight rather than passengers, although I would not underestimate the scope for successful passenger services. I do not believe that the previous experiments with passenger trains coming into Waterloo from Scotland or from the West country really told us anything; indeed, the trains were slow, they were not advertised and they did not have the benefit of the marketing that one would wish for.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para58"></a>If one takes a longer view, it seems to me that there is scope in considering providing sleeper carriages and putting cars on trains so that people travelling to southern Europe from the North can do so overnight without spending a tremendous amount of time driving. There is scope for passengers, but I suspect that there is even more scope for freight. I also believe that there is an odd psychological benefit in having good quality international passenger links. As regards London, it is interesting to note that there has clearly been a great improvement in its image among many young French people. They have decided that coming to London and living and working here is more viable because they can have an easy rail journey. Of course, they could otherwise take a relatively easy flight, although I must admit that it would not be as comfortable. I am not suggesting that Manchester is going to spawn a whole new French community, but the fact that it does have absolutely first rate passenger services will be of some benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para59"></a>My second argument for having such links is a political one. As I know only too well, northeners do not need a great excuse to feel aggrieved by decision makers down south. That is particularly so when they feel the decision makers down south, as they will see it, sometimes spend a huge amount of time worrying about second order issues which would not benefit them in any event. The Dome is probably the classic example of that, but it is not the only example. I refer to the lottery money spent on arts establishments and the amount of Cabinet time spent worrying about the Royal Opera House. If you live in Manchester or Leeds those appear not to be proper priorities for government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para60"></a>It seems to me that the question of the rail links north of London has assumed a political importance which almost goes beyond the economic benefit that such links would provide. Such feelings clearly are bad for a sense of national unity. In my view, there is no better way for the Government to be seen to be batting for the northern regions than if they were seen to be taking these issues rather more seriously than has been the case in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-19_para61"></a>As other noble Lords have mentioned, the history of the CTRL is absolutely dire. I suspect that when the textbooks are written on great failures of British public policy making from 1950 to 2000, after the poll tax the story of the CTRL will be one of the greatest failures and one of the most popular examples chosen to instruct students on how not to do it. I spent three years attempting to get off the ground plans to revive railway land at King's Cross. As your Lordships will remember, there was a King's Cross railways Bill that took literally years to get through another place and this House. <P>


<a name="column_1319"></a>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mountevans: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. The Bill was not withdrawn in this House. I was one of the two people who took it through this House. It was not given Royal Assent, but the original King's Cross Bill passed through both Houses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, in a sense that strengthens the point I made. The Bill reached the final point in the legislative procedure but was then withdrawn. Years were wasted and by that stage hundreds of millions of pounds had been spent on bringing forward the plans. We were left with a total hiatus of policy making. Clearly, the position today is much more satisfactory in that at least we have a plan for getting the CTRL built, albeit in a slightly fractured way. Anyone who has followed the history of the decision making on that will want to pay tribute to the Deputy Prime Minister and other Ministers for working hard to make that part of the link a reality.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para0"></a>However, I am aware of no plan that looks 10 or 20 years ahead which has any firmness to it--and to which the Government have put their name--and which addresses how we shall get beyond London. That seems to me to be a critical problem. I believe that when making the announcement in another place on 3rd June, the Deputy Prime Minister became slightly exasperated when people asked him what he intended to do about links north of London. He replied, in effect, "For goodness' sake. I have nearly killed myself getting links to London. Don't try my patience and ask me to do the impossible". Although that is an understandable reaction, it is not satisfactory. Having reached this point, I hope that the Government will soon be able to produce at least a vision--if not detailed plans--as to how international rail services might be developed. It is possible, of course, that that will appear in the transport White Paper, but I somehow suspect that it will not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para1"></a>I conclude with a couple of questions for the Minister. I believe that on 3rd June the Deputy Prime Minister said that he had asked the consortium to consider bringing forward plans for international rail services north of London by the end of the year. Has the Minister any news on the timetable for that? Might something emerge a little earlier than the end of the year? I would also welcome anything the Minister can tell us about the proposals for an international service from Heathrow by 2001. From the point of view of the northern regions, that is an interesting suggestion. But in a sense it is rather a threat because if everyone suddenly becomes terribly enthused about having international rail services going that little bit further to Heathrow rather than further north, all attention will be focused on that. In thinking of that proposal--if one is going that far--has any thought been given to linking up with the North West and thus benefiting that region? We need a fast service with the minimum number of stops to get people from the North West across the Channel. Going via <P>


<a name="column_1320"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1320</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Heathrow really is a case of going somewhere via Slough. I cannot believe that going via Heathrow would be the solution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para2"></a>I refer to the Virgin proposals which have been raised by other noble Lords. Do the Government have a view on these proposals? Are they feasible? Instinctively, I feel that a plan which has at its heart a station called Watford International has something missing. It does not have the brio even of Lille, but perhaps that is pure northern prejudice. Do those proposals cut across the ideas and plans that the consortium is currently developing? If Virgin can do that,- why cannot the consortium?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para3"></a>Railways clearly have a tremendous potential to bind together countries and regions both economically and politically. The Government still have the opportunity to ensure that despite all the delays and confusion to date the Channel Tunnel eventually fulfils its potential for the North West and the other northern regions. I hope that the Minister can give us some reassurance this evening that that opportunity will at last be seized.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-20_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, for his introduction to this debate and--if I may say so--for the context in which he set us thinking about the issues before us tonight. As he suggested, it is important that we consider the Channel Tunnel Rail Link in the context of transport links within the European Union.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para4"></a>It is interesting to note that the West Coast Main Line, the East Coast Main Line and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link all form part of the EU's plans for the trans-european network. It is important to view the problems that we are approaching in that context as well as to view them in the economic and regenerative context that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, referred to, and indeed the political context. I can assure the noble Lord that if I had any doubts about the strong feelings of those in the regions of the North of England my noble friend Lady Farrington, sitting beside me, would make sure that I was well aware of those concerns.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para5"></a>We recognise the frustration that has been expressed by I believe everyone who has spoken tonight that the services to the regions for which they have argued not just on this occasion but also on many occasions in the past are not yet in place. It is important to recap briefly the background to the current situation, to which the noble Lord, Lord Newby, referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para6"></a>The deal put in place by the previous government with London and Continental Railways to build the CTRL and operate Eurostar was flawed from the start. In January it almost collapsed. The company could not fulfil its contract and requested an additional &#163;1.2 billion of taxpayers' money, on top of &#163;1.8 billion already committed. That was unacceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para7"></a>We were faced with a clear choice. We could have abandoned the contract with LCR and invited new tenders or we could have asked LCR to reconsider the financing of the project and come forward with <P>


<a name="column_1321"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1321</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposals to meet all of its original obligations. We chose the latter option because abandonment of the contract and a further delay of two years or more, would have led to further uncertainty and blight and would have resulted in two-thirds of government grant being spent on Eurostar's debts and continuing losses with nothing in return. The deal we secured will provide a high-speed Channel Tunnel Rail Link. I am grateful for the acknowledgement of the role played by my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para8"></a>The CTRL project can now proceed without delay. The solution we have negotiated ends the uncertainty about the continuance of the project. I should make the following issue clear as it has been raised specifically by the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, and by other noble Lords who have spoken. There is a commitment to build the entire railway from the Channel Tunnel to St. Pancras. LCR will remain under a contractual commitment to deliver the whole project. It plans to commence work later this year. The first section of construction should be completed by 2003, with the full CTRL, including the vital connection to the West Coast Main Line, planned for completion in 2007.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para9"></a>I reassure the noble Lords, Lord Mountevans and Lord Inglewood, and others who raised the matter, that once the CTRL is opened the infrastructure will be in place for seamless journeys between the regions and the Continent for which noble Lords have argued. The Government, LCR and Railtrack are working hard to take the proposals forward so that construction can start later this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para10"></a>I now turn to the Eurostar service. LCR has chosen a consortium to run Eurostar comprising British Airways, National Express and the national railways of France and Belgium. The consortium members have a strong track record in delivering high-quality passenger services across Europe. I understand that they have plans to maximise growth in Eurostar's existing inter-capital business, to increase frequency of services, to reduce check-in time and to improve on-board service standards. They have already announced their intention to establish a service from Heathrow airport to Paris which, it is hoped, in due course will enable Heathrow to develop as a hub for services across the country and as a gateway to Europe. The Government are committed to a fully integrated transport system. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Mountevans, that the plans proposed by the consortium for a hub at Heathrow are innovative and we hope that they will provide greater choice to those travelling for business or for pleasure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked specifically about progress. We understand that the consortium is developing those plans urgently for the Heathrow to Paris services. The noble Lord also raised concerns about whether, in the long term, such plans would foster the direct links about which he was concerned. The issue of Watford as a hub rather than Heathrow was mentioned, although not exactly the same view was taken by noble Lords who spoke.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para12"></a>We were asked to give a commitment that the provision of Eurostar services to the north of England would start as soon as possible. The Government understand the desire <P>


<a name="column_1322"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1322</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for that commitment and share the desire for direct services to the regions. The noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, put that question directly. However, he acknowledged, as did other noble Lords, that the viability of those services--the length of time they will take; the number of people who would wish to use them; and how attractive a service from Glasgow to Paris which could take around 10 hours would be--has to be considered and an analysis made. Even a service from Manchester to Paris taking around five hours compared with the four hours the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, mentioned, is considered the crucial journey time in relation to whether business travellers decide to travel by air.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para13"></a>It was because we shared the desire to see those services in place that my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister asked the consortium, as part of the deal arranged to ensure the future of the Channel Tunnel rail link, to review urgently the feasibility of regional services and to put proposals to the Government before the end of the year. The timing remains the end of the year. We cannot prejudge the outcome of the review that has been commissioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para14"></a>As several noble Lords mentioned, including the noble Lords, Lord Cadman and Lord Inglewood, a proposal has been put forward by Virgin to run regional Eurostar services. It was acknowledged, certainly in the contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, that these matters are sometimes not as simple as they can be made to appear. We have to consider whether the Virgin proposal would in itself divert revenue from the existing Eurostar service, undermining its viability and the viability of the deal that has been struck around CTRL. These matters deserve closer scrutiny. I understand that Virgin made the proposals direct to London and Continental Railways, a company in which, noble Lords will recall, Virgin is a shareholder. I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Mountevans, that London and Continental Railways has asked the consortium to consider Virgin's proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para15"></a>I now turn to the issue of frontier controls raised by the noble Lords, Lord Cadman and Lord Mountevans. The Government recognise that the addition of domestic passengers on regional Eurostar services might make those services more commercially attractive. But, clearly, we have to ensure passenger security. Passengers on international train services must be subject to the same controls used at ports and airports. Provided proper procedures are in place, there are no frontier control reasons why regional Eurostar services which carry both domestic and international passengers should not be operated. The Government would be happy to receive proposals as part of the review that is being undertaken. Whether those controls take place on board the train or at stations is a commercial operating decision for Eurostar. I understand that the original Eurostar plans included on-board Customs and immigration controls.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para16"></a>Noble Lords also asked why it is not possible to begin some services on the West Coast Main Line now, using rolling stock which is not currently being utilised. As was recognised by the noble Lords, Lord Cadman and Lord Mountevans, there are some technical problems which currently prevent the operation of regional Eurostar rolling stock on parts of the existing network. Those <P>


<a name="column_1323"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1323</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problems are mainly related to electrical interference associated with track circuits which have prevented the issue of safety clearances required before passenger services can be operated. I understand that Railtrack and Eurostar are working together to ensure that the necessary safety cases can be issued for those trains. The Government have made clear their commitment to the operation of a safe railway network and the need to solve these problems. Until we can guarantee their safe operation it would not be right for the trains to come into use.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para17"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Inglewood and Lord Newby, referred to the issue of rail freight. The Government are determined to put rail freight back at the heart of Britain's rail industry. There has already been considerable traffic growth in freight carried through the Tunnel and, as noble Lords will recall, last year, in return for extension of the Eurotunnel concession, the Government negotiated a valuable package of benefits for rail freight. The opening of the CTRL should also permit an increase in freight on the existing network by freeing up capacity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-20_para18"></a>In conclusion, the Government recognise the importance to the regions of good international rail links. We believe that the deal that has been agreed around the Channel Tunnel rail link will provide real regenerative and economic opportunities. We look forward eagerly to receiving the review from the consortium later this year on regional services, and I shall inform the House at that time of the outcome of the review.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: There are two arguments that I could normally advance on this amendment, but I shall leave one of them until we discuss the next group of amendments. That argument relates to the uncoupling of the membership of the Scottish parliament from the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster. I shall leave that until later and concentrate on another aspect, which I believe is very important.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para6"></a>In bringing forward their proposals, the Government have rightly recognised the special position of Orkney and Shetland and decided--and I agree with them--that in the Scottish parliament Orkney and Shetland should be two separate constituencies. As the Committee will know, they have until now been one constituency from the point of view of membership of the House of Commons. It seems to me that the argument for special consideration extends to the Western Isles, which is in exactly the same position. Yet I can see that a future Boundary Commission review might decide, for example, with some logic, to move Skye into the Western Isles, given the very much improved ferry links. I believe that the Western Isles should be separately considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para7"></a>I have some special affection for the Western Isles, having stood there in the Conservative cause at one stage. I did not even manage to save my deposit, but I had a very pleasant time, none the less. I was happy to show that there was no rancour on my part when I decided, as the Scottish Health Minister, that they should have a new hospital, and they were kind enough to invite me to the opening of that to show their appreciation. In fact, they still show their appreciation whenever I visit by happily showing me around what they consider is at least partly my hospital. It shows my magnanimous spirit when not only do I give them a new hospital in exchange for not being allowed to save my deposit but am also prepared to say that in the Scottish parliament they should be given the same consideration as Orkney and Shetland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para8"></a>Paragraph (d) relates to a slightly different issue. It has always seemed to me that the principal talent of Boundary Commission reviews has been to be innumerate. I am amazed at how they have decided to apply the electoral quota in Scotland, not simply on the last review, but time after time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para9"></a>The electoral quota in Scotland is 54,000. We shall come to other aspects of that when we deal with the next group of amendments. Aside from the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland and Caithness and Sutherland, to which a later amendment refers, and Roxburgh and Berwickshire, four clearly rural constituencies, the smallest constituencies in Scotland are those vast tracts of land represented by Glasgow Baillieston, Glasgow Pollok, Glasgow Shettleston, Greenock and Inverclyde, Hamilton South, Midlothian, Paisley North and Cumbernauld and Kilsyth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para10"></a>At the other extreme, looking at the largest constituencies, in number terms, in Scotland, there is Eastwood. I would not argue about that. It is not as compact as the Glasgow seats which I listed, but it is at <P>


<a name="column_1325"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1325</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>least reasonably compact. The next one is Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber, where there are 66,500 voters, 12,500 above the Scottish quota, and hugely bigger than any Glasgow seat and, I suspect, than virtually any seat in West Central Scotland. The largest seat in West Central Scotland is Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, with 66,500 electors. That is the largest geographical seat.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para11"></a>It seems ludicrous that we should have these large rural seats with large populations while we have city seats with next to no population in comparison. It is not as though the Boundary Commission has decided that the cities need special attention. The average electorate in Glasgow after the previous boundary review was 51,500. Edinburgh seems to have managed with over 10,000 more, at just over 62,000.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para12"></a>I have no faith in the Boundary Commission to look at the map of Scotland and--as I think the noble Lord, Lord Hughes of Woodside discussed with regard to the previous amendment--to be fair to the rural areas of Scotland. It is for that reason that I suggest that we should say to the Boundary Commission that it should arrange matters so that the average electorate in the constituencies lying in the highland region, in Aberdeenshire, Moray, Argyll and Bute, Angus, Perthshire, Kinross, Stirling, Dumfries and Galloway should have a lower average than those lying wholly or partly within other unitary local authorities, which are largely the ones in West Central Scotland that I mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para13"></a>The fact that I am making a brief speech on this matter does not in any way mean that I do not feel strongly about it. I have always felt strongly about it. Indeed, when I was a Back Bencher in the Parliament before last in your Lordships' House, I attempted to persuade my Government to amend the Representation of the People Act to give primacy to the quota and take it away from other things which I believe are of less importance. I am afraid that I was unable to prevail on my noble colleagues and my colleagues down the corridor to accept my amendment. I suspect that they perhaps now regret that a little, but that is another matter. The Minister says that it would not have made any difference, but it would have been for the whole of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para14"></a>Here we are to have a new Scottish parliament. If we are all aware, as I believe we are, of the feeling in rural Scotland that the constituencies there may well be dominated by Glasgow and the conurbations, it seems to me important that we give a clear signal to the Boundary Commission that it must not follow in the steps of its previous reviews. I could list the largest constituencies in Scotland to make my point, but I shall not do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para15"></a>All I will say is this. How can anybody justify Glasgow Baillieston at 49,000; Glasgow Shettleston at 48,000; Hamilton South--goodness knows why it receives special attention--at 47,000; and at the opposite end of the spectrum, Dumfries with 63,500 and Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber with 66,500. Even if we look at Ross, Skye and Inverness West with 56,000, the figures speak for themselves.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para16"></a>I hope the Minister will at least express understanding of and sympathy with the point I am making and that we might, even if my amendments are not well drafted, find a way of sending an instruction to the Boundary Commission when it comes to make up the boundaries for the new Scottish parliament after the first time round saying, "For goodness sake, please do your sums, both in number of electorate terms and the size of the seats". I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-21_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   I rise principally to speak to my Amendment No. 9, which is grouped with Amendment No. 8. I was tempted to put my name to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, but as I did not understand it when I read it, I thought I should wait to hear the explanation first. Having heard it, I am extremely interested.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para17"></a>There was another reason. As the Clan Mackay's traditional tribal homelands would be partly in Caithness and partly in Sutherland, I felt it would be fun to give the noble Lord a little test with my amendment. Also, as he said, it is difficult to address both of those amendments without straying into the arguments touched upon by the next group. I shall try to limit myself specifically to the point in Amendments Nos. 8 and 9, which are closely linked.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para18"></a>In simple terms, Amendment No. 9 merely adds one extra constituency by dividing the current constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross into two. It is not my intention to suggest that there is a particularly strong case for Sutherland and Easter Ross to be divided into two constituencies. My purpose is to probe the Government on the principles underlying both the composition of the parliament as it will be composed when it is first set up and also the principles as it goes further into the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para19"></a>I chose Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross simply because it is my home. I can at least talk about something of which I know a little. The fact that I am chairman of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross Liberal Democrats and came second on the Liberal Democrat Highland list has nothing to do with it. However, in case anybody thinks it might, I mention it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para20"></a>My purpose is to probe the Government and find out a little more about their thinking on the principles underlying the composition of the parliament, particularly with regard to how we see the constituencies. I have argued on a number of occasions in your Lordships' Chamber--particularly with regard to local government when we debated the constitution in the summer of 1996 before the last election--that the relationship between geography and a sense of community as well as population density when working out the areas which people represent is important.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para21"></a>Local government is an interesting example of how that can work for different areas. For instance, we can take the new council that operates in the Highlands. For most people in the outlying areas it has been extremely unsuccessful. It will be difficult to find anybody from any political party in Caithness who thinks that the Inverness Highland Council works to their benefit. On the other hand, it is clear that the new unitary councils <P>


<a name="column_1327"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1327</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have worked well in the central belt and that many of those people are happy with them. Clearly, therefore, there is a difference between how geography and a sense of community comes into play as against population density when looking at how people should be represented.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para22"></a>I ask the same question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish--what is so special about Orkney and Shetland? What is the principle behind that which could not be applied to other areas within Scotland? If it is simply a question of numbers, it may be argued that one should not have more than a certain number of people in the Scottish parliament. We have heard people talk about Wales having a certain number and Northern Ireland having more. How many people should be there?
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para23"></a>My only comment on that is that I would far rather see people slightly over-represented than under-represented. There is a far greater danger where people feel that there is nobody to whom they can talk; there is nobody to whom they can go--that touches on the earlier argument regarding the links with constituency MPs--there is no one that they feel they own as their member. It is much better if people feel that they can relate to two rather than to none. At the beginning of the parliament I would rather err on the side of having more members than on the side of having too few.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para24"></a>In the debate on the first group of amendments we talked about the systems in other countries. I do not think that we should be looking to other countries for models. I do not think that we should be looking at Westminster for a model. I think we should ask, "What is the new parliament intended to do? What is the function we wish it to achieve?"; and then from that point look at the best way of constructing a model to represent the people. If we found that something that worked in Finland or in the United States of America happened to help us achieve the function which we had determined as being correct, that would be useful. It might even be useful to look at some of the things that happen in Westminster. But it should not be the point of departure. The point of departure should be, "What is the function?", and then we should have the model. It is on that basis that I come back to the question of geography.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para25"></a>When people are represented, certain issues are of a constituency nature. In this connection the question of population is relevant. The work of an MSP who has a constituency of 40,000 may well be less than that of someone who has a constituency of 80,000. Perhaps more important is when one comes to the question of regional interests, which was very much the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hughes. The regional interest that one will find in one area is of equal importance to the regional interest that one will have in another area, albeit that the size of the population is very different.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para26"></a>Here it is perhaps worth looking at another country. In the United States of America the Senate takes the view that the interests of Vermont or Idaho, which are very small states, or Arkansas, where I worked years ago, are identical to the interests of California or <P>


<a name="column_1328"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1328</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Florida, which are extremely large states. Therefore, there is an acceptance of the principle that there are certain interests in a given area which are of importance. I share the concern--I will not put it any stronger than that--that the central belt may have an influence above and beyond that which one would like to see. I am trying to find out what importance the Government attach to the geography and to the sense of community which, as the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, said, an area such as Aberdeen or Caithness has in relation to being represented. That is the core question which the amendment is designed to test.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para27"></a>I wish to make one other brief point. I think there is an error of drafting in line 9 of Schedule 1. Heading (c) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the parliamentary constituencies in Scotland, except a parliamentary constituency including either of those islands", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
referring to the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands. I think it should say,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"either of those archipelagos", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
or,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any of those islands". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
But I think that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"either of those islands", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
is not strictly correct. I leave the Government with that little thought.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-21_para28"></a>What I should like to hear from the Government is some assurance as to the importance of regional and geographical issues--Caithness is very different from Sutherland and Sutherland is very different from Aberdeen--so that we do not get into the Catch-22 of ever-reducing numbers of seats, a point raised by the next group of amendments about which I have nearly managed to avoid speaking, and so that we do have a strong representation that remains strong.

<A NAME="80708-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   I should like briefly to back up what my noble friend has said. I have experience of Caithness and Sutherland, and as I no longer have much connection, I can be frank. There is an enormous difference between Sutherland, which is Celtic and Highland, and Caithness, which is part-Highland and more Norse than anything else and very agricultural. The difference is great. They do not care for each other all that much, which makes it very difficult for the representative there. So I think we need two. My noble friend has a very good point.

<A NAME="80708-22_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   Perhaps I may say to my noble friend, "You might say that. I couldn't possibly comment".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   In Amendment No. 8 the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, raises the interesting proposal that if the Bill guarantees separate representation for Orkney and Shetland, then the Western Isles should be treated in the same way. That is a fair point. We had presumed that the geographical nature of the Western Isles would result in their forming a single constituency for all time, although I recognise <P>


<a name="column_1329"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1329</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that, the way the Bill is framed, that is not guaranteed. However, I shall be more than happy to take back this matter and consider the point further.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para0"></a>However, before sweetness and light breaks out all round the Chamber, I cannot accept the second leg of the amendment, which would effectively fetter the discretion of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission in drawing up the constituencies for the rest of Scotland. As phrased, it would ensure that areas within the Central Belt were always comparatively under-represented. I accept that some regard should be paid to the special circumstances of rural areas, but the amendment as it stands goes too far.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para1"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Thurso, has argued for special status to be granted to Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. His knowledge of that area--dare I use the words that he used of "special interest" in that area--is well known. I am not persuaded by his arguments. There have been no calls to divide the existing parliamentary constituency in the way that he suggests. I do not believe that the area would gain by doing so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para2"></a>Like other parts of the Highlands and Islands, Sutherland and Easter Ross will benefit from the fact that there will be an additional seven members returned from the area thereby ensuring that the interests of Scotland's more remote communities are fully considered by the parliament. Perhaps I may resort to figures for a moment. If we consider the regional constituency of the Highlands and Islands and look at the number of electors per MSP, we shall find that if we split Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, the figure would be 20,456 electors per MSP. For Scotland as a whole, it will be 30,759. I believe that that would create too much of a discrepancy if we went down the road of splitting that individual constituency.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para3"></a>The noble Lord asked me what considerations the Boundary Commission takes into account. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, gave primacy to the quota. I have some sympathy with that. That is modified by the Boundary Commission in also taking into account geographical considerations although the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, pointed out persuasively that that is not consistently applied throughout Scotland, and rural seats tend to have a smaller electorate than suburban seats in some of the cities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para4"></a>The Boundary Commission is able to take into account geographical and community factors as well as the quota itself. I am not convinced by the arguments that have been advanced. I am happy to take back the question of the Western Isles. I recognise the importance of rural areas and account should be taken of them. However, I cannot go as far as noble Lords would like me to go.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-22_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I hope I made it clear that I genuinely chose the case of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross by way of example. I did not for a minute think that he would not find it extremely easy to get a brief together which would allow him to refute the arguments for those areas.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para5"></a>We both share the same desire to see this Bill through in the fastest possible time and to see it enacted so that we can both get into the Scottish parliament. I believe I am right in saying that. I do not want to hold up the progress of the Bill. I am a little disappointed with the Minister's response to the overall question of the importance of geography.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para6"></a>I know that I am straying into the next group of amendments in saying this, but for years my grandfather's constituency was known as Caithness and Sutherland. It is now Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross--and Easter Ross is very different. What happens when that constituency becomes Caithness, Sutherland and Ross-shire or Caithness, Sutherland, Ross-shire and Inverness-shire, as may happen? It takes me four hours, driving at the limit that the law will permit, to get from one end of the constituency diagonally to the other end. That is a long time. There are genuine reasons why geography is important to any MP or MSP serving such a constituency. I shall not move my amendment when we reach it--that is exactly what I said that I would do--but at the moment I am slightly disappointed. I hope that in the course of the Bill's progress a fuller commitment will be made to the importance of geography.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I am sorry that the noble Viscount is disappointed. He should not feel alone--90 per cent. of the people to whom I speak are disappointed by what they hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Perhaps I may intervene between two Members of this Committee who seem keen to get to the Scottish parliament. I presume that it is because they have worked out that they will be better paid than your Lordships. I shall not go so far as to wish them well. They might use that against me when it comes to the election literature. On the other hand, it may damage both of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para7"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his answer on the Western Isles. I do not want to go into this at too great length, but I recall that when the Boundary Commission last met it considered the proposition that Skye could become part of the Western Isles constituency. I thought at the time that that would be wrong, although I can see the numerical argument for it. I am grateful to the Minister for being prepared to take this away and reconsider it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para8"></a>I am not entirely sure to what extent I should side with the noble Viscount, Lord Thurso, because I suspect that the Sinclairs probably robbed the Mackays of their land in Caithness and Sutherland--or else they were better at cards, which may well be more the case!
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para9"></a>The noble Viscount could have gone a little further. The three constituencies in the Highlands area have a total electorate of 165,000, which makes an average of 55,000, which is just above the Scottish quota. As I sat here listening to the Minister, I counted 26 urban constituencies which have fewer than 55,000 electors. That is the point to which I should like to draw the Committee's attention. There can be no justification for such a distribution.
<P>


<a name="column_1331"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1331</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para10"></a>I think that I have made my point. I believe that I heard the Minister express reasonable sympathy for the general proposition that the Boundary Commission should take such factors into account. I do not think that constituencies in large rural areas, such as Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber or Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley should have electorates so far above the Scottish average. Their electorates are 12,500 above the Scottish average. I have always thought that that is indefensible when at the same time the constituencies to which I have referred and many others, such as the two Paisleys, are the size of postage stamps in comparison and have much smaller electorates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para11"></a>However, I have made my point and the Minister has been sympathetic on the question of the Western Isles and moderately understanding on the general point of the need for the Boundary Commission to take such numerical factors into account, along with the geography. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "80708-22_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: Our interesting conversation about Orkney and Shetland reminds me that my great-uncle was Jo Grimond, once leader of the party to my right. It is interesting that, apart from my amendment, all the other amendments in this group come from those Benches. I shall speak only to Amendment No. 10 and shall do so quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para15"></a>In this amendment I am seeking to ensure that we do not take away what we gave to the Scottish people in the referendum. It is terribly important that the Scottish people perceive that what we gave to them will be allowed to continue. What concerns me with regard to the West Lothian question--this may have been answered in part a little earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Ewing--is that if the number of Members of Parliament is reduced--I am referring to Members of the mother Parliament here at Westminster--it may be argued that the number of MSPs should be reduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para16"></a>After very careful consideration the Government have decided in this Bill to have 129 MSPs. It would be totally wrong to change that in the first few years of the parliament. If the Scottish parliament decides to change that number that is a different story. However, it is wrong that because the number of MPs is reduced so the number of MSPs also reduces. I appreciate this means that there will be two different constituency boundaries: one for the MPs who come to Westminster and one for those who go to Edinburgh. That may cause voters confusion, but it is very important to avoid any unseemly fight for seats in the Scottish parliament at the second election if the number of seats is reduced. The Scottish parliament must be seen to work in the eyes of the public.

I regard this as the most serious debate to be held today on the amendments. Both the Minister of State and the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, paid proper tribute to the work of the constitutional convention. They reminded us that the proposal for which we are now legislating was based on the report of the constitutional convention. I can tell the Committee that there was no issue more thoroughly debated, argued and discussed, both formally within the convention and in the corridors outside, than the vexed question of the appropriate number of members of the new Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para18"></a>There is every indication that the Government propose a major breach of the agreement reached in the constitutional convention. I do not claim for one second that the constitutional convention has the status of holy writ, but it is a serious matter and the Government must produce cogent arguments to depart from something that has been carefully arrived at. We agreed on 129 members of the Scottish parliament: 73 from the first-past-the-post constituencies and 56 through the added member system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para19"></a>I remind the Committee that at that time there was no commitment from the Labour Party to reduce the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster. On a previous occasion I confessed that that issue had been skilfully side-stepped by the convention on the basis that it was no part of its function to deal with the problems of Westminster. That was a convenient camouflage to conceal the total disagreement between our party and the Labour Party on the question. We said quite openly, as we did during the election, that one consequence of the creation of a Scottish parliament should be a reduction in the number of Scottish Members serving at Westminster. In that respect we followed the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Constitution way back in the days of Lord Kilbrandon. On the other hand, the Labour Party refused to accept that. That was the position at the last general election.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para20"></a>Following the election but before publication of the White Paper the Labour Party began to see sense and agreed that part of the overall constitutional package should be a reduction in the number of Scottish Members at Westminster. So far so good. But at the initial stages of the passage of the Bill through another place no suggestion was made that there should be any future alteration in the number of members of the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para21"></a>I come to my second point. When the issue was debated at Committee stage of the Bill in the other place there were private discussions, which I shall not go into, and also discussions on the Floor of the House on the <P>


<a name="column_1333"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1333</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>question whether, following the reduction in the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster, there should be a similar reduction as the Government had suggested in the number of first-past-the-post Scottish members of parliament, the argument of the Government being that the constituencies should remain the same so that if the number was reduced from 73 to whatever the number might be, the same number of first-past-the-post constituencies should apply in Edinburgh.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para22"></a>During the progress of the Bill my honourable friend, Jim Wallace, moved an amendment to make sure that the number of Scottish MPs in Holyrood would not be reduced, in accordance with what the noble Lord, Lord Rowallan, was saying. In the light of hints given by the Minister in charge of the Bill in the other place he withdrew his amendment. We were told that this issue would be revisited in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para23"></a>We are revisiting it now. I would regard it as a breach both of the constitutional convention's proposals and a breach of the nods and winks from the Government in the other place that we should now be faced with the possibility of reducing the numbers of Scottish members in the parliament at Holyrood when the Westminster reduction takes place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para24"></a>It is not for me to give advice to the Labour Party but I must say in passing that every time we read headlines in the Scottish press about Scottish Office ministers being given instructions from south of the Border, whether it be from the Prime Minister, the Labour Party national executive or whoever, we see another slide in the opinion polls. Unfortunately, there have been many headlines. Whether they are justified or not I do not know. The impression has been given to the people in Scotland that the Government have been sat upon from on high and told that the number of Scottish constituencies must be reduced in line with those for Westminster. That is a fundamental mistake.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para25"></a>We have tabled Amendment No. 15 and a number of consequential and paving amendments associated with it which would leave the number of constituencies for the Scottish parliament at 73 when the reduction for Westminster takes place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para26"></a>The Government may argue that that would be too confusing and that there would be two sets of constituency boundaries in Scotland, one for Westminster and one for Holyrood. I understand that argument, and to meet it we have tabled an alternative amendment, Amendment No. 22, which states that if the number elected by first past the post is reduced in line with the Westminster reduction, then the number of added numbers should be accordingly increased so that the number of Scottish members in Holyrood remains constant at 129.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para27"></a>My first argument is that it is a breach of the constitutional convention; my second argument is that it is a breach of understandings achieved in the other place; and my third argument is that it is simply not sensible to make this reduction. The figure of 129 has been conceived as the right number of members of parliament to carry out the functions bestowed on them by the Bill. It is the right number to service all the committees that will be created. There is no magic about <P>


<a name="column_1334"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1334</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it, but the number fits in with the number of regions in the added member system and the number of constituencies that exist now. It is sensible to retain that number, all the time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-22_para28"></a>For a parliament to be elected next year and then, when it meets, for it to be told that 17 members will have to be culled before the next election, not by the electorate but by Act of Parliament, is complete nonsense. I hope that the Government will listen intently to the debate and agree that we should stick by what was in the Bill originally before any reduction was contemplated and that we should ensure that the parliament in Holyrood goes forward with its full 129 members and sticks with 129 throughout the necessary changes that will be made at Westminster.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   If it worries the Minister--and I think it should after yesterday--I am in almost total agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood. I was not party to conversations on the constitutional convention and, in any case, I do not believe them to be Holy Writ. However, I have come to learn one or two things about the Government. The manifesto is certainly Holy Writ and the White Paper is quite close to it. The White Paper made very clear at paragraph 4(5) that the distribution of seats in the House of Commons would be reviewed by the Boundary Commission and the Government would take away the requirements about minimum number of seats. They have translated that into Clause 81 which says clearly that the Boundary Commission should in the future make the Scottish quota not the 54,000 that I discussed a little while ago but the 65,000 as it is in England. Roughly that means that Members of the other place from Scotland will be reduced by 14.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para0"></a>I have no problem with that. It is not the complete solution to the West Lothian question, but it narrows the angle and is justified as part of this package. The problem then is that we come to Chapter 8.2 where we were promised 73 constituency members and 56 additional members. This is where I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood. I do not believe that 129 was arrived at as the correct number for the job; I think it was arrived at by saying we start off with 73 first-past-the-post, and to achieve a reasonable proportionality using d'Hondt we probably need seven additional members for each one, so we have 73 to 56. Indeed, elsewhere in the Bill that proportion is laid down.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para1"></a>If the Members of the other place are reduced by 14, and the first-past-the-posts are reduced by 14 in Scotland, there will have to be a reduction of seven in the regional members to keep the ratio. Some little twirls will be needed in the mathematics to round up, but I think that we can roughly say that. Therefore 21 members, give or take a member, will have to be removed. As the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, said, one cannot think of anything worse as a start to this new parliament: everyone who goes in looks at everyone else and asks, "Well, am I one of the 21 or am I one of the lucky 108?" It is hopeless.
<P>


<a name="column_1335"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1335</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para2"></a>The other reason why I think it is hopeless is that it is not devolution. It may seem strange that I should start preaching this, but if one is to have devolution one should decouple the number of Members of the Westminster House of Commons from what we have in the Scottish parliament. It seems crazy. I told the Minister that his words would come back to haunt him. They are doing that already. This is a mature Parliament. It should be allowed to decide how many Members it wants to have.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para3"></a>It is mad to suggest that in the first term of this parliament 21 members will have to have their throats cut, so to speak--figuratively of course--not at the behest of a Scottish parliament but at the behest of the UK Parliament. If I use the words "the English Parliament", "the Westminster Parliament" or "the Whitehall English Parliament", those Members of the Committee who come from Scotland will immediately see the considerable tactical advantage the SNP will be given. I just do not understand it. Even if the polls are not right, there will be many more members of the SNP in that new parliament than many people thought there would be when they set out on this devolution track. To hand them a little piece of ammunition like this seems to me to be stark, staring bonkers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para4"></a>Even before that--the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, referred to it--there was a headline in the Scotsman:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Blair snub for Dewar on seats at Holyrood".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I do not know what causes the Scottish polls to go the way that they are going. At this time of night, I shall not bore the Committee with my theories. But I surely know that headlines like that have a great deal to do with it. It is late and we are making short speeches, but the Minister should not take that in any way as an indication that I at least do not feel strongly about the issue. Equally, I know that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, feels strongly. As I probably will not come back on this, I hope that the Minister will take on board what we are saying. I hope that his colleagues will take on board what we are saying. I hope his colleague in Downing Street will take on board what we are saying.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para5"></a>If I were to give the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, any advice from my slightly longer membership of this place than he has had, it is not to call a Division at this time of night but to let the Government think again over the Recess. They will have time before Report stage. Then he can bring this back in rather more prime time, when I suspect that if the Government do not see sense we might be able to repeat our feat of yesterday, give or take a vote or two.

The Catch-22 situation that has been created is, frankly, indefensible.

<FONT SIZE=3>reduction must also be reduced has no logic. As my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, said, it is being taken by all those to whom I have spoken in Scotland as a straightforward slap in the face.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para6"></a>The Minister knows my strength of feeling in seeing the Bill succeed. I earnestly beg the noble Lord to consider the matter again and to return at a later stage with an improvement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Amendments Nos. 11, 12, 14, 15, 19, 20 and 10 seek to break the link between constituencies for the United Kingdom Parliament and constituencies for the Scottish parliament. Amendments Nos. 11, 14, 15, 19 and 20 seek to provide for a separate review of Scottish constituencies and Amendment No. 10 fixes the current UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland as the Scottish parliament constituencies. Amendment No. 12 seeks to fix the number of constituency MSPs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para7"></a>I cannot accept these amendments. After thinking long and hard on these matters, the Government have concluded that the balance of advantage lies with maintaining the link between Westminster and the Scottish parliament constituencies. We gave careful consideration to the arguments advanced for breaking the link, but have concluded that the disadvantages outweigh the possible advantages.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para8"></a>In the White Paper, we explained that we believed that the integrity of the Union would be strengthened by having common constituencies for the Scottish parliament and the UK Parliament, with the exception of Orkney and Shetland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para9"></a>If Members of the Committee will allow me, I shall read paragraph 8.7 of the White Paper on which the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and I have campaigned for a "Yes. Yes." vote at the time of the referendum. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The integrity of the UK will be strengthened by common UK and Scottish Parliament boundaries. Responsibility for Scottish Parliamentary electoral arrangements and constituencies will be reserved matters; the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for Scotland will continue in being and future changes in electoral arrangements for the Scottish Parliament will therefore be a matter for the UK Parliament subject to consultation with the Scottish Parliament. Any changes in Westminster constituencies will result in changes to Scottish Parliamentary constituencies; and may also lead to consequential adjustments to the size of the Scottish Parliament so as to maintain the present balance between constituency and additional Member seats". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That was in the White Paper. That is what we campaigned on. Having looked at the arguments again, on balance we think that that is the right proposition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para10"></a>The effect of these amendments could, over time, lead to different parliamentary constituencies for the Scottish parliament and UK Parliament with overlapping boundaries leading to confusion among the electorate--a point that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, recognised. I am not sure that the electorate would appreciate why it was necessary for them to be in one constituency for Westminster but another for the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para11"></a>I am confident that once the Scottish parliament is established and its working practices are in place, it could operate perfectly effectively with fewer MSPs. Fewer members would still be able to carry out properly <P>


<a name="column_1337"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1337</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the scrutiny of the Scottish administration and the enactment of legislation. We should keep this debate in proportion. We should remember that the other place has only 72 Members representing Scottish constituencies to scrutinise legislation covering both reserved and devolved matters at present. It is anticipated that even after a review, the Scottish parliament would have more than 100 members. It will remain a substantial body.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   If the Scottish parliament is to end up with 108 members--although I do not suppose the noble Lord, Lord Steel, will agree with me on this--I believe that it would be better for it to start with 108 members and remain at that level rather than for it to go to 129 members and then back to 101 members.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-23_para12"></a>Secondly, I suggest that the Minister is not too enthusiastic about this case because his colleagues in the Scottish parliament will read his advocacy of it and suggest that he is one of the 21.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   That assumes something that I should not be prepared to assume under any circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   Before the noble Lord answers that point, perhaps he will answer the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay. Is it the intention that not just the first-past-the-post constituencies should be reduced but also the additional members?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   It is important to maintain the ratio. The ratio will be maintained between first-past-the-post constituency representatives and regional list representatives. So yes, there is a proportional reduction in the number of list members as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para0"></a>The reason for not having 108 members, which the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, anticipates at this stage, is because we do not know that 108 will be the number that the Boundary Commission for Scotland will recommend when it carries out its next review. In any event, it would shatter the thing that we are building upon; namely, the identity of boundaries and the coincidence of constituencies for both the Westminster and Holyrood Parliaments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   Will the Minister confirm that it is a point of principle that the number of directly elected members is greater than the number of members from the regions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Yes, it is a point of principle for us that the main building block is the directly elected constituency MP.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para1"></a>I turn briefly to the detail of the various amendments. The amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Rowallan, would fix, for all time, the current constituencies and not allow any future changes to be made. Amendment No. 12 also seeks to fix the number of Scottish parliamentary constituencies from the outset. However, I must point out to the noble Lord that it would actually have the effect of increasing the <P>


<a name="column_1338"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1338</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>constituencies to 75 when one takes account of the provision for Orkney and Shetland. I assume that was unintentional.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para2"></a>The other Liberal Democrat amendments put an additional burden on the Boundary Commission for Scotland to carry out two reviews. That would greatly add to the burden on the commission and make it very difficult for it to administer its already complex process of constituency reviews with potential for delay.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para3"></a>The amendments also try to provide a role for the Scottish parliament in deciding its own electoral boundaries. That is not appropriate and is totally at odds with what was proposed in the White Paper. As Members of the Committee know, electoral arrangements for the parliament are reserved to Westminster, reflecting their importance as part of the overall devolution settlement. This includes the decisions on the parliament's constituencies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para4"></a>Amendment No. 22 approaches fixing the size of the parliament from a slightly different angle. It maintains the Scottish parliamentary constituencies the same as the Westminster parliamentary constituencies. But it provides for the size of the parliament to be fixed at 129 by increasing the number of regional members to make up for any decrease in constituency members.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para5"></a>I recognise that that is an interesting approach, but, I am afraid, not one that the Government could support. If we made this amendment, then after the first review by the Boundary Commission, the number of regional members would exceed the number of constituency members. That is not what we intend. That is a major point of policy for us.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para6"></a>Chapter 8 of the White Paper made it clear that a constituency link will be the essential foundation of the new Scottish parliament. However, the White Paper also recognised that it was important to provide for greater proportionality to build stability into the system. The additional member scheme was devised to correct the imbalance between a party's share of a vote and the constituency seats won, to ensure a closer relationship between votes cast and seats won. While I understand why noble Lords may support the increased role this amendment would give to the regional members, I do not think it is appropriate that they should outnumber the constituency MSPs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para7"></a>What we propose is that a reduction in directly elected members should be matched by a reduction in those elected from regional lists. This is a sensible way to preserve the overall shape of the proportional system that we have put forward. That system is the area in which our package is perhaps at its most radical and reforming. It seems odd that the Liberal Democrats, of all people, should be complaining about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para8"></a>The Government's view is that Scotland's interests will be best served by a parliament which is more effective and efficient. There is no case for having more MSPs than is necessary for the effective functioning of the parliament and the proper representation of the people. I believe that, even when the parliament does <P>


<a name="column_1339"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1339</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reduce in size, it will still be able to function effectively and efficiently. In view of my response, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   I am acutely disappointed by the Minister's reply. Perhaps I may concentrate for a few moments on Amendment No. 22, which the noble Lord said was an interesting proposal. Indeed, it was designed to ensure that, if we are going to use the new reduced number of Westminster seats as the building block for the first-past-the-post system, there should be some compensation in the additional member lists.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para9"></a>If it is the entrenched position of the Government that the additional members should not exceed the first-past-the-post members, I accept that that is a perfectly legitimate point of view. In that case, we could come forward with a revised version of Amendment No. 22 at a later stage of the Bill to ensure that that objection is met.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para10"></a>However, the debate raises a whole new issue. Is it really sensible to embark upon the election of a parliament of 129 members with a view to reducing that number to 108 at the time of the next election? I do not mean that purely in electoral terms; we should perhaps think in hard terms of pounds, shillings and pence. We will be designing a new parliamentary building. Are we designing it for 129 or 108 members? It seems to me that the taxpayer has an interest here in getting the issue right at the beginning of the process. Although I shall not be pressing the amendments tonight, we shall certainly want to re-visit the matter at a later stage. I appeal to the Government to reconsider the matter seriously before we reach the later stages of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   Before the noble Lord withdraws the amendment, perhaps I may suggest to him the following alternative. The 21 extra members whose throats will, as it were, be cut could be replaced with 21 appointed members. That way, one would preserve the majority of first-past-the-post members and have 21 people appointed by way of a contribution to art and the culture of Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-24_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   I thought that the noble Lord was going to suggest that they could form a second chamber. Indeed, that would take us back to an earlier debate. In all seriousness, the most constructive course I can take is not to press the amendments and to suggest, in a genuine and constructive spirit, that we should perhaps give further thought to the whole question of numbers before we reach the later stages of the Bill. I do not believe any of us in the Committee regards the present disposition as at all satisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-24_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   I, too, am very disappointed with the Minister's reply. I thought that we might have some movement. I am most concerned that this Government seem very intransigent in their views. They seem to be playing more and more into the hands of the more nationalistic of the Scottish people with every move they make. I agree with everything that my noble friend Lord Mackay, the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and other Members <P>


<a name="column_1340"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>of the Committee have said in this most interesting debate. This is a fundamental and terribly important point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-24_para11"></a>I was very tempted initially to divide the Committee on the issue because I consider it to be most serious. However, having listened to the debate, I think that I would prefer to discuss the matter with my noble friend Lord Mackay and the noble Lord, Lord Steel, to see whether we can come forward with sensible ideas and table them jointly on Report. Nevertheless, I must still record my great concern. As I said, this is a most important issue and I believe that we could be making a great mistake.

I understand that my noble friend had the honour of being the first opposition Peer to have an amendment accepted to the Government of Wales Bill. I look forward to his receiving a similar honour in this Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   As the noble Earl has explained, this amendment would require the Boundary Commission for Scotland to lay any report recommending changes to the Scottish parliamentary constituencies before the United Kingdom Parliament as well as the Scottish parliament. I assure the noble Earl and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, that this amendment is not necessary. The Secretary of State is already required to lay reports of the Boundary <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Commission for Scotland before the United Kingdom Parliament in any case where the report recommends changes together with the Secretary of State's proposals for giving effect to those changes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para0"></a>However, given the potential significance of such a report for the constituencies and the electoral regions of the Scottish parliament, we thought it was appropriate that the Boundary Commission for Scotland should lay before the Scottish parliament any report it makes recommending alterations in the parliamentary constituencies, and any consequent alteration in the electoral regions. We have therefore made specific provision for that in paragraph 3 to Schedule 1. The short answer is that the Secretary of State will still be obliged to lay the report before the United Kingdom Parliament. But to ensure that the Scottish parliament, which has a clear interest in those matters, also has a copy of the report, it was necessary to have paragraph 3 to Schedule 1. With that explanation I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-25_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   Perhaps I might ask the noble and learned Lord about this matter. It strikes me that the report is to be sent to the Scottish parliament merely for its information. If, as the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, told the Committee, parliamentary constituencies will be decided by the Westminster Parliament, what is the point of letting the Scottish parliament know about the matter in advance? How is it to deal with this information when it is a reserved matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   The position is that the Scottish parliament will be able to take into account the recommendations in the report and will be able to consider what representations it should make to the United Kingdom Parliament. There would be consultation between the Scottish parliament and the United Kingdom Parliament, although the ultimate decision as to the alteration of any boundaries in terms of the report and the recommendations of the Secretary of State would be taken by the United Kingdom Parliament in the light of representations made by the Scottish parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-25_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I think I understand this matter now. In other words, the noble and learned Lord is saying that both the Scottish parliament and the United Kingdom Parliament will always be informed. The only matter that concerned me briefly was this. If the commission does not make any recommendation, it appears only to have to report to the Secretary of State, not the Scottish parliament. Am I correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   That is correct--the reason being that, if there is no recommendation for any change, one would not envisage the United Kingdom Parliament taking it upon itself to change the boundaries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-25_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   With that assurance, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para4"></a>Clause 2 [Ordinary general elections]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-25_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon </B>   moved Amendment No. 23:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 5, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) The Secretary of State shall not appoint a day for the first ordinary general election if it is a day on which a parliamentary election, European Parliamentary election or local government election is scheduled to take place.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This amendment is grouped with a number of others which address the same issue; namely, whether it should be competent for elections to the Scottish parliament to take place on the same day as a general election, elections to the European Parliament and local government elections. With the leave of the Committee, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 24, 25, 27, 28, 33 and 78.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para6"></a>The Bill proposes that the date on which the first ordinary general election for the membership of the parliament shall be held shall be appointed by order of the Secretary of State. But subsection (2) of Clause 2 provides that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"subsequent ordinary general elections shall be held on the first Thursday in May in the fourth calendar year following that in which the previous ordinary general election was held". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para7"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that in Scotland local government elections take place on the first Thursday in May. It is obviously competent for a general election to take place on that date; and although, as I understand it, the next European parliamentary elections are scheduled to be in June of next year, it might also be competent for them to take place on the first Thursday in May. The amendments seek, shortly but importantly, to raise the question of whether it would be sensible for elections to the new parliamentary body, namely the Scottish parliament, to take place on the same day as one of the other elections to which I have referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para8"></a>In Scotland the proposal to hold more than one election on the same day has given rise to considerable concern, particularly among the representatives of CoSLA. As the Minister will be well aware, on 18th June this year the president of CoSLA, Councillor Keith Geddes, wrote on behalf of CoSLA and on behalf of various group leaders of CoSLA--the Labour group leader, the Liberal Democrat group leader, the SNP group leader, the Conservative group leader and the non-aligned group leader--to the Secretary of State raising CoSLA's concern. In that letter he said, referring to the issue of having the next round of local government elections on the same day as the first elections for the Scottish Parliament:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As you know, the issue is of substantial concern within the local government community". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He sends this letter on a cross-party basis,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"underlining the extent to which there is a local government consensus about this matter which transcends the normal political divides". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We believe that the elections should not take place on the same day, for the following reasons". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1343"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1343</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
First, he says that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is a likelihood of considerable voter confusion. There was evidence of this at the devolution referendum in terms of the requirements to complete two ballot papers; the requirement this time to record three votes simultaneously will be without precedent in Scotland". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
One could add to that that, if a Scottish parliamentary election were combined with another election--for example, a local government election--which involved some form of proportional representation, which is not impossible, in the long term confusion might arise not only from the number of votes to be cast but also if some votes were to be cast in accordance with one form of proportional representation and others were to be cast in accordance with another form.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para9"></a>Secondly, he makes an important point which relates primarily to the effect on local government elections. He says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whilst it is highly likely that the combination of the two polls on the one day will result in a higher turnout for the local government election which we would naturally welcome, the cost of this is the likelihood that voters will be voting on national issues and not on local issues. The election of the new Parliament will inevitably take precedence in the public mind. Local government elections need to stand in their own right and have their own justification". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I suggest that that is a sentiment which would find support in all quarters of the Chamber. The third point he makes is as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There are bound to be enormous pressures on political parties in resourcing two simultaneous elections". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para10"></a>Fourthly, he deals with the position of independent candidates. This is a point which is relevant not only to local government elections but also to the Scottish parliamentary elections. He says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We also believe that the combined elections may potentially disadvantage independent candidates, who traditionally stand in rural parts of Scotland. This is because voters will be making party political choices at the Parliamentary election and there is the obvious danger of voting patterns being transferred into local government elections". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para11"></a>It seems to me that there is a great deal of sense in what the president of CoSLA said in his letter to the Secretary of State of 18th June. I understand from press reports that the Government are considering the matter. On that basis, I hope that we shall receive a positive response from the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para12"></a>I should make it clear that I am in no sense committed to the precise details of moving the elections from the first Thursday to the second Thursday of May. I am open to suggestions for alternative dates. The purpose of the amendment is to seek to establish the principle that the election to the Scottish parliament should be the only election which takes place on a particular day.  I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   There is no question but that the noble and learned Lord has a point. Extremely complicated voting papers will be involved and it may well be that there is a degree of confusion. But we find that in countries which have adopted complex voting <P>


<a name="column_1344"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1344</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>systems and PR, the electorates--who are no more intelligent than our electorate--become used to it and make a good job of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para13"></a>I do not believe that we should rule out, by inserting it in the Bill, the fact that we could have two elections on one day. That needs to be left to the Scottish parliament. It will save a great deal of money, which is always useful. The Scottish electorate is sophisticated enough to cope with that and the design of the voting papers--to which a great deal more attention needs to be paid--can play a big part.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-25_para14"></a>The point should be left open and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response. The noble and learned Lord has a point, but there is a point also in being able to hold two elections on one day in certain circumstances.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Before the Minister replies, perhaps I can intervene. I am sure that he is in close touch with CoSLA. I wonder whether they appreciate that, in making this request, according to what the Minister has told us already, they are ensuring that the parliament is reduced to 100 or so members, because the boundaries would have to be coterminous.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   Amendments Nos. 23, 28, 33 and 78 are designed to prevent the combination of elections to the Scottish parliament with any other elections in any circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para0"></a>Members of the Committee will be aware that voters in Scotland face three elections next year: to the parliament, to local councils and to the European Parliament. Local elections are due in May and European elections in June. The thinking behind these amendments appears to be--it is confirmed by what was said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon--that electors should have to turn out separately three times in a row in short order to vote in each of these elections. We take the view that that would not be a reasonable demand. We think that we would risk "voter fatigue" and that turnout would suffer. We think we should do what we can to avoid that because all of these elections are important. For that reason, we intend to hold the elections for the new parliament on the same date as has been set for local council elections; that is, 6th May 1999. The election date for the parliament will be formally set by an order to be made by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State under Clause 2 of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para1"></a>We are aware that some in local government, in particular, argue that a combined poll will be confusing to voters. I am of course aware of the letter quoted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, and mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy from CoSLA to the Secretary of State. However, we do not agree with the problem raised in relation to confusion among voters. We do not believe that voters will find it difficult to distinguish between the two polls on the day and believe, as was put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, that that argument does not do justice to the electorate. I firmly believe that voters would be much more unhappy at having to make no fewer than three visits to polling <P>


<a name="column_1345"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1345</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>stations in a matter of months. I am surprised that the noble and learned Lord is not equally concerned about this.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para2"></a>Moreover, we are hopeful that going down the route of a combined poll will substantially increase the turnout for the local elections. We should all be seriously concerned that the turnout in local government elections falls well short of the turnout in general elections. The need to improve local election turnouts was, in our view, one significant reason in favour of combining these elections next May. We are keen to ensure that Scottish local government should enter its new relationship with the Scottish parliament with the strongest possible democratic mandate. That can best be achieved on the basis of a high electoral turnout. This is indeed an opportunity to renew democracy at both national and local level throughout Scotland. It should be welcomed and planned for on those terms and not regarded as an inconvenience.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para3"></a>We accept that it will be a more complex task to manage a combined poll. That goes without saying. But nothing we have heard from election professionals leads us to the view that what is proposed cannot be done. We are working closely with all those involved in the conduct of elections to ensure that we put in place sensible, workable arrangements which will deliver on the day. It is worth remembering that combined polls are not unusual in England. For example, the 1997 general election coincided with local elections and to the best of my knowledge this worked perfectly well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para4"></a>These amendments seem to be an over-reaction. No one denies that a combined poll is a more complex task to run than a single election from the point of view of those managing the system. But from the point of view of voters, we firmly believe it is a far better option--indeed one bringing some real benefits--than that canvassed by the noble and learned Lord. I therefore invite him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para5"></a>I turn now to Amendments Nos. 24, 25 and 27, which I understand are drafted with the aim of avoiding the possibility that at some future point the elections for the Scottish parliament could fall on the same date as the elections for local councils, purely as a result of the operation of their two electoral cycles.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para6"></a>I accept that there is a possibility that local government and parliament elections could coincide in future. However, I doubt that providing that in those circumstances there should be two polls, a week apart, as these amendments appear to do, is a particularly sensible answer or one which voters would welcome. For the reasons I have already explained, we do not share the noble and learned Lord's total resistance to combined polls. We believe that there are times when these will be the most sensible way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para7"></a>It may be worth adding that it would in any case be a mistake to legislate in this Bill on the basis of assumptions about the future shape of the local government electoral cycle. The commission chaired by Neil McIntosh is currently looking at the relationship between local government and the parliament, and part of its remit is to make recommendations about the future electoral arrangements for local government. I should <P>


<a name="column_1346"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1346</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>also add that currently local government elections must take place every three years from 1999 onwards under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1994. Unless that is varied, they would not coincide with the parliament elections in 2012. In addition, on a technical point, Clause 2(5) already provides the parliament with some limited discretion as to the timing of its own general elections.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para8"></a>I cannot see that simply moving by one week the usual date for Scottish parliament elections would in any way be a sensible answer to whatever concerns noble Lords may have about combined polls. I note the noble and learned Lord said that he was not completely wedded to one of these amendments. I would therefore ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, although I do not support the amendment moved by the Conservative Party because I believe there should be flexibility in this matter--there may be occasions when it is sensible to run polls concurrently--there was one sentence in what she said that took me a little by surprise. She said that none of the professionals in the Scottish electoral process had made representations on this point, or words to that effect. I certainly read press reports that the electoral administrators had lodged a complaint with the Secretary of State about the local elections and the first parliamentary elections falling on the same day.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para9"></a>I make one serious suggestion to the Government which they might like to consider. There is a difference between the first election and future elections. We are introducing a new system. There will be two ballot papers. We will have discussions later on in the proceedings on the Bill about the nature of those ballot papers. At the moment we are proposing to run local elections on the same day so there will be three ballot papers. Is it not sensible to consider possibly delaying the local elections next year by one month and running them on the same day as the European Parliament elections in June in the hope that we might thereby increase both the turnout for the local elections and the European elections-- both of which give us cause for concern--and leave the Scottish parliament election free-standing with its new system and two ballot papers on the same day in May? That is a constructive suggestion which I hope the Government might consider.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   What I said was that nothing we have heard from election professionals leads us to the view that what is proposed cannot be done. We have had representations. I did not wish to lead the House into thinking that I was saying that we had not had discussions and problems raised with us. We do not believe that they are insurmountable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   Does the noble Baroness agree that it is not impossible, but difficult?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-26_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   We said that we do not believe that it cannot be done, but it is difficult. <P>


<a name="column_1347"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1347</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I have admitted all the way through that trying to run two elections on one day is much more complex than running one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para10"></a>We have looked at the specific point of the European elections. We cannot see that the alternative of combining the European elections with the local elections would be any simpler. The next European elections will also take place under a new voting system. It is also a complex matter. We have looked at it. We do not have closed minds on anything. At the moment, we feel, as I said, that this is the best way forward and has advantages apart from the complexity of administration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   Can my noble friend answer a question to which I should perhaps already know the answer? When she speaks about a combined election, I assume that she means an election on the same day? My limited experience of two different elections taking place on the same day is that the voter has to go to one polling station, get the ballot paper, vote, and put it in the box within the same building. Then he has to go to a different polling station and go through the process again. My only experience of that was that a number of people--I do not know how statistically significant they were--voted once and said, "Och, I have done mae duty, I'm nae going to bother voting again.". That was a local government situation. During the regional council elections there was a city council by-election in Aberdeen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-26_para11"></a>Has the possibility been examined of the voter collecting the ballot papers for both elections at the same time and putting them in the same box? The separation process at the counting of the votes would be slightly prolonged while the papers were sorted out into the different areas. The complication is that in local government elections the seats will certainly not be coterminous with the parliamentary seats. But it should not be beyond the wit of the returning officer to make sure that ballot papers are provided within each polling station. One does not just wander in and go anywhere. It is all set out where one has to vote. It is possible to have the papers for the local government elections issued in the right place so that there is no confusion in the voter's mind. This may already have been decided in which case my speech is superfluous. It is an issue that came to mind that we should look at the possibility.

<A NAME="80708-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   We are quite open in looking at all kinds of possibilities. I note what the noble Lord said and I am sure it will be looked at. The local government elections and the Scottish parliament elections have the advantage of being both on the same franchise. The date for the European elections has been announced as 10th June.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-27_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Minto: </B>   I wonder whether the noble Baroness will take her mind back to the progression through this House of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. It was the will of CoSLA (in an amendment that I moved on its behalf) to make the term <P>


<a name="column_1348"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1348</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of office of those in local government in Scotland four years rather than three. We do not know what recommendations we shall receive from the commission. If Mr McIntosh, its chairman, were to raise that issue, perhaps the noble Baroness could refer back to the papers and to the Hansards of that time because we very nearly won that vote. It was very close indeed. There are obviously good reasons for local government periods of office being coterminous with those relating to posts in water and health and for all to have four-year periods, rather than for water and health to have four-year terms and local government to have a three-year term as at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-27_para0"></a>I advise the noble Baroness that this matter needs consideration - and not merely in relation to the letter from the president of CoSLA, with a copy of which he kindly furnished me some weeks ago, but also with regard to the history of the 1994 Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-27_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I thank the noble Earl for that. His comments will certainly be noted. I believe that that letter from CoSLA was widely distributed. Many noble Lords have probably received a copy. We are considering the whole process. It will be for the McIntosh commission to consider the points which the noble Earl has raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-27_para1"></a>Perhaps I may expand a little on my reply to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes. With regard to holding local government and parliamentary elections on the same day, it is expected that voters will attend only one polling station. Together with returning officers, we are considering whether separate ballot boxes could be used.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-27_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   The subject of voter confusion has been raised. Does the noble Baroness agree that since the elector has only to put a single X on each ballot paper, there should not be too much confusion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-27_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I agree.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   Despite the arrival of the noble Baroness at the Dispatch Box, the theme does not seem to have changed very much. One is reminded of the prayer with which the Highland Kirk session began its monthly meetings, "Almighty God, we pray that we may be right because we will never change our minds"!
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-27_para2"></a>In all seriousness, CoSLA's letter seems an example of consensus--a consensus debated no doubt at some length by its members. As the noble Baroness is no doubt well aware, that is not the first letter from CoSLA. There was one back in August of last year when CoSLA specifically raised the point of postponing the local government elections for one year to avoid the risk of having to have three elections, on whatever dates they might take place. This is not a matter to press to a vote at this time. No doubt whether he wishes it or not, the Minister's right honourable friend the Secretary of State will have to discuss the matter further with CoSLA. It was very much the views of the representatives of CoSLA, who are all elected representatives, that I placed before the House.

<A NAME = "80708-27_para3"></a>The idea of the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, of combining European and local government elections merits serious consideration. It might well boost the polls of both. We want to avoid any confusion whatsoever in the first ever elections to the Scottish parliament, whether of ballot papers being improperly franked or the wrong ballot paper going in the wrong box, or what have you. Although the amendment is to be withdrawn, I hope that the Government will give the matter serious consideration. I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 23.

Page 2, line 17, leave out ("Presiding Officer") and insert ("First Minister").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80708-27_para6"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Amendment No. 26 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 29 and 31. The amendment raises the very short question as to why the responsibility for calling polls in certain situations rests on the presiding officer and not the first minister. It appears to us that, as the first minister will be the political head of the Scottish executive, if situations arise where, for example, the executive no longer commands the support of the parliament, a vote of no confidence having been passed against it, there is no reason why the offer of resignation which the first minister must make to Her Majesty cannot be combined with the request that a poll should take place. The amendment seeks to probe why this responsibility has been placed on the presiding officer and not the first minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   Although the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, moved the amendment briefly it is important in principle. The trouble is that the Conservative Party remains wedded to the translation of the Westminster system to Holyrood. As I read the Bill, there is no question of votes of confidence leading to the right of the leader of the government party to dissolve parliament, as happens here. On the contrary, the Bill clearly provides for a fixed-term parliament. That fixed term can be breached only by a two-thirds vote of parliament itself deciding that there be an exception to that term and that therefore there should be a dissolution. With great respect to the noble and learned Lord, I believe that he is fundamentally wrong in principle. It is right that if the parliament decides to breach that rule the person who dictates the date of the election should be whoever is in the chair of that parliament, not the head of the executive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-27_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   These amendments would give the first minister a limited role in setting the dates for elections to the parliament. The key element of the Bill as regards the timing of elections is that there will be a four-year fixed cycle, proposed in the White Paper and set out in Clause 2(2).

<FONT SIZE=3>out in that clause may not be appropriate. For that reason we have provided that there should be some limited flexibility available as regards the timing of general elections. The date may be varied by up to one month either side of the day on which the election would usually fall. This is a commonsense provision intended to cover only very exceptional circumstances. The Bill also provides in Clause 3 for extraordinary general elections where clearly the provisions for a four-yearly electoral cycle will not apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-27_para7"></a>In both these cases we took the view it was right that it should be the presiding officer who proposed the date of the election. This is wholly in keeping with the thinking behind a fixed cycle, removing decisions on the timing of elections from the control of the executive. It ensures that the decisions are taken in a politically non-partisan manner. I confirm that that was a key element in the thinking of the Scottish Constitutional Convention when it proposed a four-year fixed cycle. Against that background, to give the first minister the ability to influence the timing of elections would be quite out of place. It would mean that we would not in practice deliver the independent arrangements for setting election dates clearly implied by the White Paper and which this Bill has been deliberately drafted to achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-27_para8"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, that yet again noble Lords opposite appear to be overly-influenced in this matter by their experience at Westminster. I therefore invite the noble and learned Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-27_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   My Lords, having never been in the other place and only having been here for a few years, I do not consider myself to be over-influenced by anything, certainly nothing that I am prepared to admit to in public.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-27_para9"></a>I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, that my amendments are difficult to square with the provisions of Clause 3(1)(a) requiring a two-thirds majority, but he will be aware that that is the next issue to which I seek to turn.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-27_para10"></a>It has been suggested that the presiding officer's powers under Clause 3(1) are to be exercised in a non-political or non-partisan way. When one looks at how that would come about--by either a resolution to dissolve the parliament, presumably passed in the face of opposition by the Scottish executive, or a failure to appoint a first minister--one does not need much imagination to know that there would be a lot of politics involved in such a situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-27_para11"></a>It is clearly not a fundamental point but it was one which seemed worth airing. Having aired it, I seek leave to withdraw Amendment No. 26.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para0"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: The amendment seeks to delete from Clause 3(1)(a) the need for a resolution to dissolve the parliament to be passed by a majority on a division with the number of members voting in favour being not less than two-thirds of the total number of seats for members of the parliament. This is not the only occasion in the Bill where more than a simple majority is required, and I will turn to at least one of those examples in the fullness of time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para1"></a>During the debates on the referendums Bill my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish explored various possibilities as to the form and size of majority that would be required. Time and again back came the answer, particularly from the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, that a simple majority was the only sensible way of doing it, it would command support from the general electorate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para2"></a>Exactly those arguments apply in this case. If the Scottish Parliament considers a resolution to dissolve the parliament, and there is a majority vote in favour of the resolution, but the majority is not large enough to pass the test set out in Clause 3(1)(a), what will happen? Scotland will be faced with a parliament that can repeatedly pass votes of no confidence in the Scottish executive, and that can repeatedly fail to reach the necessary agreement by vote as to who the replacement first minister will be. Then some 28 days later, once the time limit set out in the Bill has run its course--that is Clause 43(3)--the presiding officer, under the terms of Clause 3(1)(b), will have no alternative but to propose a day for the holding of a poll and make such proposal to Her Majesty. It only postpones the day when an extraordinary general election is required.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para3"></a>I firmly believe that when a parliament votes, the majority of those voting on the day in question should carry the day. Although I argue this matter simply and shortly, I believe it is of fundamental importance. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   My objection to the amendment is the same as to the one we have just discussed. The noble twins on the Front Bench have not grasped the essential difference between the nature of a Scottish parliament and the Westminster system. It was set out in the constitutional convention's proposals, in the White Paper, and is now in the Bill, that this will be a fixed-term parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para4"></a>A fixed-term parliament is different from that at Westminster where there is a maximum-term Parliament of five years, and where the decision upon holding an election within that time is entirely at the convenience of the Prime Minister. We are all familiar with the system. Sometimes the Prime Minister chooses the date voluntarily and sometimes involuntarily when the Government have lost a vote of confidence, as happened in 1979.
<P>


<a name="column_1352"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1352</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para5"></a>We have deliberately set our minds against such a system in the Holyrood parliament. The other Mackay twin accused me earlier of believing that everything at Holyrood would be sweetness and light. I can assure him that I am not that naive. I do not believe that it will all be sweetness and light, but I hope that it will be sweeter and lighter than what we have at Westminster. That is why the system of a fixed-term parliament is set in the Bill. It follows that it should not be at the convenience of the executive or the first minister to call an election when he wishes, or, indeed, to stage manage an election when he wishes by having a simple vote in the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para6"></a>Once one accepts the principle of the fixed term, it is right that the Bill should specify that only in special circumstances should that fixed term be breached. Hence the reason for the two thirds majority. If, for example, there were a vote of no confidence passed by the parliament the presiding officer's first obligation, as I understand it, is to recommend to Her Majesty someone else who will form an administration. Only if, after due course of time, that is impossible would there then be a call for a further election; in other words, the Bill deliberately sets itself against a chance election within the four-year period. That is why on principle--not as a matter of detail--we on these Benches are opposed to the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   Whatever mechanism is built in to the constitution, it is possible for it to be circumvented or used. Due to the lateness of the hour I shall not give a number of examples where I know that to have happened. If the first minister wanted to have an election on a particular day, I am certain that it would be possible by a combination of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, described as a "lot of politics". I think that at the other end of this building we called it "the usual channels". It may be the usual channels at this end of the building as well. People met behind the Speaker's Chair and a deal was thrashed out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para7"></a>The fact that a two-thirds majority is required is no guarantee that people would play the game as the constitutional convention envisaged, as the parliamentary draftsman wrote it, or as we desire that it should operate. I do not believe that this is a significant matter. The amendment would not add to or subtract from the situation, except that, if the amendment were to be carried, the possibility of manufactured instances, where the fixed-term parliament could be breached, would be a great deal easier. There is no guarantee that it cannot be done one way or another.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   There are a few places in this Bill where we think that the nature of the powers to be exercised by the parliament merit the safeguard of a two-thirds majority, putting a decision beyond the realistic reach of any one party. There are three such places in the Bill. They are the removal of the auditor general at Clause 66, the removal of a judge at Clause 89 and the dissolution of the parliament. It is the last of those which the noble and learned Lord addresses in his amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para8"></a>It may be helpful if I explain why we have included the dissolution of the parliament in this list. The Bill is specifically drafted to separate out decisions on the <P>


<a name="column_1353"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1353</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>timing of elections from the control of the executive--the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para9"></a>This is the thinking behind a cycle of four-yearly elections, the fixed term parliament, and the role given to the presiding officer in the unusual event that the precise four-year timetable does not apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para10"></a>By ensuring that a dissolution can happen only with a two-thirds majority, we are ensuring that simply by being able to command a majority of the parliament, an executive does not also gain the ability to bring forward the date of an election to its perceived benefit by forcing a dissolution. This is an important safeguard which underpins the whole approach taken to the setting of election dates in the Bill and which follows directly the proposals of the constitutional convention. Without this provision it is too easy to imagine how in certain circumstances the possibility of dissolution would become a political gambling card.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para11"></a>I accept the observations of my noble friend Lord Hughes of Woodside based on his experience at the other end of the building. I accept that one cannot guarantee in all circumstances that the way in which something is intended to happen will in reality happen. We can try to make it that little bit more difficult. That is what these provisions seek to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para12"></a>Another factor is worth considering. We shall have an electoral system where more often than not a single party may not have an overall majority. We know from comparative examination of similar political electoral arrangements that there is a temptation in those circumstances to have a rolling series of dissolutions. We should try to make the situation that little bit more difficult by providing this two thirds requirement. We do not seek to keep a lame duck administration almost against the will of the parliament, but to ensure that we have that degree of separation between the calling of the election and the power of the executive; and to make dissolution a little more difficult in situations where, perhaps because of the electoral system that is being used, there may be the temptation to seek dissolution too often.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para13"></a>In those circumstances, I hope that the noble and learned Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I understand the argument that the Minister advances but I do not accept it. Equally, I note that he did not have sufficient courage to face up to the point I raised: that if one can change the constitution of a country following a referendum by a simple majority, one cannot bring a parliament to a premature halt by the same majority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para14"></a>I appreciate that it is a matter on which the Government feel strongly. On these Benches, it is not one about which we wish to go to the wall. Therefore I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Page 2, line 44, leave out subsections (3) and (4) and insert--
<BR>
(''( ) If a poll is held under this section, the day on which the next ordinary general election falls to be held (disregarding section 2(5)) shall be the second Thursday in May during the third calendar year after the calendar year in which the poll under this section has taken place.'').
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para17"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This amendment deals with a problem which to some extent is already acknowledged by the provisions of Clause 3(3) and (4); namely the occurrence of an extraordinary general election a matter of months before the date on which the next ordinary general election would have taken place in other circumstances. Subsection (3) presently provides that if that extraordinary general election is within a period of six months of the projected date of the next ordinary general election, that next ordinary general election may not occur. But because the date of the period of six months was chosen, one could accordingly have a situation where there were two general elections within a period of seven, eight or nine months of each other. That seems to me undesirable for a variety of reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para18"></a>Amendment No. 32 would have the effect, if I calculate it correctly, of ensuring that where an extraordinary general election took place, the next ordinary general election would be at least some 2&#189; years further on in time and possibly three years, four months further on in time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-28_para19"></a>It seems to me that if we are anxious to avoid repetitive general elections, the Bill could be improved by expanding on the period of six months provided in Clause 3(3). For that reason, I bring forward Amendment No. 32. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80708-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, obviously has a point here. However, the solution in the Bill is much simpler and also avoids having close-to general elections. The solution of the noble and learned Lord is rather more complicated. Therefore, I should prefer to leave the matter as it stands in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I understand that the noble and learned Lord's amendment seeks to provide that a parliament elected at an extraordinary general election will sit for a period of approximately three years. It ranges between the periods indicated by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon. By contrast, the Bill provides that, except in one limited circumstance, where a parliament is elected at an extraordinary general election, that does not disturb the pattern of four-yearly cycles set out in the Bill. In other words, regardless of any extraordinary general election, the next ordinary election goes ahead as though there had been no extraordinary general election.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-29_para0"></a>The only exception to that is where the extraordinary general election falls less than six months before the date on which the next ordinary election would have taken place, in which case that ordinary election does <P>


<a name="column_1355"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1355</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not take place. However, even in those circumstances, the original four-year cycle still rolls on undisturbed in the future. The effect of that is that in that situation, the parliament in that case may sit for a period slightly in excess of four years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-29_para1"></a>It may be helpful if I outline why we have provided for that. The Bill as drafted severely limits the attraction to any executive of forcing an extraordinary general election. It makes sure that even if an executive succeeded in forcing such an election, the four-yearly cycle will continue regardless.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-29_para2"></a>As I understand the noble and learned Lord's argument, it is that if a parliament is to be elected, then there is a case for ensuring that it sits for some substantial period and thereby avoiding two elections in quick succession. However, we do not believe that those arguments are persuasive when set against the importance of ensuring that there is as little scope or incentive as possible for the executive to influence the timing of elections.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708-29_para3"></a>We appreciate that there may be scope for the rare occurrence, which it is hoped would never happen, of a parliament being elected for a period in excess of six months with another election taking place thereafter. It <P>


<a name="column_1356"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1998 : Column 1356</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a question of balance and we have concluded that the balance lies in restricting the scope for the executive to manipulate events to its advantage. Our provision in this part of the Bill, therefore, sits with the other provisions of the Bill which seek to ensure that the date of an election is impartially set. In those circumstances and with that explanation, I invite the noble and learned Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   In the fullness of time we shall find out whether or not the balance struck by the Government is correct. Again, it is not a matter of earth-shattering importance and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   Because of the integrated nature of the operations at RAF Gibraltar it is not possible to separate the costs of civil and military operations. However, for the financial year 1997-98 the cost of operating RAF Gibraltar beyond the hours which would normally be required for RAF operations amounted to &#163;940,000. In addition, the need to support civil air operations during normal operating hours imposes demands on air traffic control, fire services cover and security, which are estimated to cost in the region of &#163;660,000 per annum. Figures for previous years are not available, but would be of the same order, less an allowance for inflation.

The recruitment of more ethnic minority personnel is, therefore, one of our highest priorities. The ethnic minority recruitment goals for the financial year 1998-99 underline the Armed Forces' commitment to make progress in this area. The initiatives we have underway are designed to encourage young people from ethnic backgrounds to consider a career in the Armed Forces irrespective of whether they wish to be officers or other ranks. The services, however, are aiming to encourage more young people from ethnic communities to take up bursaries and cadetships at universities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w01_para0"></a>Recent measures include two tri-service initiatives underway in the Boroughs of Newham and Sandwell. The Army has recently completed an ethnic minorities recruitment campaign in the Borough of Brent, the results of which are awaited. In addition, there are a number of other single service initiatives in place and all three services supplement their initiatives with targeted advertising, marketing activity, and attendance at local ethnic minority festivals and careers conventions. The overall aim is to encourage interest in the Armed Forces from the widest possible ethnic minority audience.

<P>
<UL>What progress has been made on the Army's future tactical reconnaissance capability.[HL2658]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   The Strategic Defence Review has emphasised the importance of investment in the area of fast, detailed and accurate intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, known as ISTAR. This is not only vital for combat operations, but also for many peace support operations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w02_para0"></a>We have, therefore, decided to undertake a programme of work aimed at enhancing the Army's tactical reconnaissance capability. This involves an integrated series of studies into future sensors, land reconnaissance vehicles and unmanned air vehicles. These studies will enable us to identify the most cost-effective mix of reconnaissance sensors and platforms to meet our future needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w02_para1"></a>As part of this programme, we will conduct with the United States a collaborative project definition study which will examine sensors, sensor integration and the vehicles needed to meet our armies' future manned land-based reconnaissance requirements. This joint project is known as the Armoured Scout and Reconnaissance Vehicle (ASRV) and seeks to provide a highly mobile, stealthy, battlefield reconnaissance capability. A memorandum of understanding with the United States has now been signed, and an invitation to tender will be released to industry in the near future. The United Kingdom element of ASRV is known as TRACER--Tactical Reconnaissance Armoured Combat Equipment Requirement. The United Kingdom will be an equal partner with the United States in this project, which will have major benefits for the United Kingdom Armed Forces and industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w02_para2"></a>In parallel, we are conducting national studies into the use of unmanned air and land vehicles for meeting the Army's future reconnaissance requirements. The sensor and sensor integration work carried out under the ASRV project will inform this work. We are also examining the scope for collaboration with the United States on the unmanned air vehicle element of the programme.

<A NAME="80708w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   The Ministry of Defence is not aware of any reports suggesting that some non-Gulf veterans have recently attended the MoD's Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) and been referred elsewhere within the MoD.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w02_para3"></a>The Ministry of Defence is, however, aware that a short paper was published in the Royal College of Psychiatrists' psychiatric bulletin in late February which reported that, in an unspecified 12-month period, 5 of 39 ex-service personnel referred to the Defence Services Psychiatric Centre at Catterick for the treatment of combat-related post traumatic stress disorder were patients whose description of their combat experience was largely fictitious. MoD officials have contacted the paper's author and ascertained that the period covered by the paper was 1996 and that two of these subjects were referred by the MAP. We are now attempting to identify the individuals concerned in order to determine whether they are Gulf veterans or were otherwise entitled to attend the MAP.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w02_para4"></a>MoD has also carried out an extensive search of case notes at the MAP in order to ascertain whether there have been any more recent instances of incorrect referral. This exercise identified a small number of patients who have been seen by the MAP since
13 October last year, when the MAP moved to its current location--St. Thomas' Hospital in London--and who were not Gulf veterans. However, none of these patients has been referred by the MAP to other MoD facilities or military establishments. All but two of these patients are servicemen of ex-servicemen who claimed they had been vaccinated for Gulf service, but did not deploy to the Gulf to participate in Operation GRANBY. It is our policy to allow individuals in this category to be examined at the MAP. The remaining individuals were referred to the MAP by their respective GPs in good faith, but it was subsequently discovered that one had never been a member of the Armed Forces whereas the other actually deployed to the Gulf later, in 1992, to participate in Operation JURAL to enforce the no-fly-zone in southern Iraq.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w02_para5"></a>In order to prevent further such occurrences, the registration form for MAP patients has been updated to include service numbers and patients referred to the MAP will henceforth be checked against a database of those who served in the Gulf to confirm their eligibility to attend.

<P>
<A NAME="80708w02_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will investigate the allegation made to the Chief Inspector of Prisons that prisoners in Lincoln Prison A Wing switched from cannabis to heroin use following the introduction of mandatory drug testing.[HL2505]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708w02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   These allegations have been investigated. The results of random mandatory drug testing at Lincoln do not indicate that prisoners there have moved from using cannabis to heroin following the introduction of testing. Results for prisoners on A wing are not separated from the rest of the prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w02_para7"></a>This allegation has been made in relation to a number of prisons and is not specific to Lincoln. However, statistics on mandatory drug tests results have never supported the contention that prisoners are switching from cannabis to heroin.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w02_para8"></a>Because of the concern surrounding this issue, the Prison Service specifically commissioned independent research into it. Separate studies by the National Addiction Centre (NAC) and the Oxford Centre for Criminological Research examined the evidence. The NAC draft report found that, overall, the results do not directly support substantial switching from cannabis to opiates. A 4 per cent. sample of drug misusers in the Oxford research had experimented with heroin for the first time because of mandatory drug testing, but none had persisted with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w02_para9"></a>The Government are not complacent about this and the Prison Service will continue to examine the results of drug testing carefully. My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Mr. Howarth) recently announced the new Prison Drugs Strategy, which sets out a more discriminating approach to provide a greater emphasis on tackling the misuse of drugs which cause the greatest harm, and this is a measure of our concern about the use of opiates, such as heroin in particular.

<A NAME="80708w03_wqn10"></A><B> Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What plans they have to reform the tree preservation order system.[HL2659]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708w03_spmin3"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  We have today issued a consultation paper, setting out the Government's proposals for reforming the tree preservation order legislation. Copies have been placed in the House library.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w03_para5"></a>A review of the legislation was completed in July 1994. This revealed widespread support for tree preservation orders as an effective means of protecting selected trees and woodlands in the interests of amenity. But it also identified a number of reforms which would help streamline the system and address its main weaknesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w03_para6"></a>The Government believe that the 1994 review struck a good balance between the need to ensure that local authorities are able to protect trees effectively and the need to provide an open, efficient and fair system in which the general public can have confidence. We therefore propose to reform the system in line with the 1994 review when a suitable opportunity to amend the primary legislation arises.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w03_para7"></a>In the meantime, we also intend to update the tree preservation order regulations. Draft regulations are included in the consultation paper. They would implement some of the reforms from the 1994 review and some new proposals which we believe would further improve the system. These include more streamlined procedures for keeping tree preservation orders up to date; new measures to speed up tree preservation order appeals to the Secretary of State; new provisions on the payment of compensation under the tree preservation order system; and clearer procedures for dealing with felling licence applications which involve protected trees.

<A NAME="80708w04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Changes in expenditure levels in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are determined by the long-standing population-based Barnett formula, which was adopted at the end of the 1970s and first used in 1978. It has been in continuous use since then and the Government set out the arrangements in the future in Chapter 7 of Scotland's Parliament (Cm 3658) and Chapter 4 of A Voice for Wales (Cm 3718).

<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by the Lord McIntosh of Haringey on 1 June (WA 8-9), what is the evidence that any attempt to reverse the trend from agents holding a smaller proportion of their assets in non-interest bearing accounts would place a burden on consumers and firms.[HL2534]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80708w04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The increased preference of agents for holding assets in interest-bearing accounts largely reflects reduced costs of transfer between interest bearing and non-interest bearing money. Agents are now able to earn interest on their assets while forfeiting less liquidity than in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "80708w04_para0"></a>If agents were forced to increase the proportion of their assets held in non-interest bearing accounts, this would mean losing interest earned on balances formerly held in interest-bearing accounts.

It is important that GPs are involved in primary care groups which cover the natural communities that they serve. Primary care groups will have an important role in securing the health of the populations they serve, and the public need to know who is serving their health needs.

This is the second consecutive year in which there has been an increase over the 58 deaths in 1994 which had been the lowest level of mortality since 1981. We take any death associated with VSA very seriously and will consider whether further action is required which could help prevent such tragedies.
