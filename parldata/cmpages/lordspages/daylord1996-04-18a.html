<H4><center>The House met at three of the clock: The LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</center></H4>

<A NAME = "60418-01_head0"></A><H3><center>Water Supplies: Adequacy</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dubs </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they are satisfied that there will be adequate water supplies in all parts of the United Kingdom during the remainder of 1996.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, the Government are satisfied that water supplies in Scotland and Northern Ireland are adequate for the remainder of 1996. In England and Wales, a report on the position at 31st March will be published by the Environment Agency within the next two weeks. The Government expect water companies to take all measures necessary to comply with their statutory duty to maintain supplies.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Does he agree that we are facing one of the most serious water crises in England and Wales for the past 80 years; that reservoir levels in many parts of the country, particularly Yorkshire, the north west and the south west, are greatly below the levels of normal years; and that unless there is immediate and heavy rainfall the crisis this summer will be the worst in living memory? Does the Minister agree that that calls for more urgent action than merely the report to which he referred? Given that the leakage rates for many of the water companies are still high, should there not be mandatory leakage targets for each water authority right away?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I do not take the same desperate view as the noble Lord. With all the effort that the water companies are putting in and all the additional measures they have planned for this year, we are confident that even with the low rainfall we have experienced to date and the low expectations for the summer we shall see nothing worse than the usual measures. So far as concerns leakage control, I have answered that in previous Questions. The answer is the same: water companies are doing all they can to achieve sensible levels over the next 10 years. It is important that they do so. There is no need for mandatory targets which would merely mean that the consumer rather than the water companies would have to pay.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that it would be extraordinarily foolish to express confidence about the water situation this summer? As the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said, reservoirs are extremely low due to the weather conditions that have prevailed over a long time. Is my noble friend also aware that, important though it is to reduce leakage, the considerable efforts being made to that end cannot <P>


<a name="column_784"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 784</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>achieve much change in the timescale to which the Question refers and that there is therefore a real need for people in the areas affected to attempt savings and to be economical with water? The only alternative is to take water from the rivers with the resulting environmental damage.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, leakage measures will not make much difference in the short term. They require a lot of money and take a long time to get right. As to shorter term measures, we are confident that the expensive and extensive improvements made by the water companies will put a great deal more resource at the disposal of consumers this summer than there was last and very much reduce the chance of any problems arising. Of course, I cannot promise that there will be rain between now and September. I have no adequate rain dance, and my noble friend Lord Ferrers is in no condition to do one either.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the reservoirs in Wales which supply Birmingham and Liverpool are reasonably full and that therefore they have every reason to be grateful to us? Secondly, will he be more precise and tell the House where the shortages in England are likely to be most serious? Is it in the south east and Yorkshire, or are there other areas which may be in difficulties?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, on this side of the House at least we are all grateful for having Wales as part of the UK. The noble Lord asks about areas with water problems this year. The areas of difficulty are those of North West Water where, if things become bad, there may be a need to draw upon the lakes more than we would wish; Severn Trent Water, which seems likely to get through with minor restrictions only; South West Water, which has problems in one particular area; Yorkshire Water, as noble Lords would expect; and, to some extent, the south east where the aquifers are running at a rather lower level than we would like.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, is there any resolution of the controversy between the local authorities of Windermere and other lakes which do not wish the water to be taken out and the need for water? Will it be possible to take water out of those lakes in an emergency?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, it is important for the tourist industry and others that the lakes should remain at a level at which they are beautiful to look at. It is also important that people in the locality have water to drink. The difficulties of reconciling those two considerations will be exacerbated in the short term if there is a drought and will be solved in the long term only by bringing in extra supplies of water. I cannot predict what will happen this year but we hope that matters will be resolved without causing problems to the scenic beauty.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   My Lords, if the report due to be published on 31st March does not show that satisfactory steps have been taken by the water companies what action do the Government have in mind, given the fact that in Yorkshire, for instance, the <P>


<a name="column_785"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 785</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reservoirs are only about one-third full whereas at the same time last year they were full to capacity? There followed the terrible summer and autumn and the threat that water would be cut off on alternate days. Will the Minister indicate what steps have been taken to install a pipeline between Yorkshire and Kielder reservoir?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I cannot answer the noble Baroness's second question but I shall write to her on the subject. If difficulties were to be highlighted in the report from the Environment Agency, we would take immediate steps to make sure that the water companies dealt with them. Under the Water Industry Act we have extensive powers to do so, and if they fail to comply we can throw them to the crocodiles.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, West Yorkshire suffered most badly as a result of last year's drought. The revival of industry in West Yorkshire, which has been most welcome during the past few years, was threatened by the interruption of water supplies. Will the Minister ensure that the interests of industry as well as tourism are considered as an important factor in the most severely affected part of the Yorkshire region?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew13"></A><B> The Earl of Kimberley: </B>   My Lords, has further thought been given to connecting up different areas with the canal system and also to enlarging that system to enable water to be transported from one area to another?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I have not looked at whether or not we can use the canal system but I assure the noble Lord that we are studying many projects to move water from one part of the country to another in order to deal with long-term water deficits which may emerge over the next few years.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the water industry in this country spends some &#163;23 billion implementing EC water directives whereas we spend only &#163;1 billion on infrastructure work such as storage facilities and the delivery of water? Have we not somehow got our priorities wrong at great expense to the British community?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I do not have the exact figures but those quoted by the noble Lord appear to be of the correct order of magnitude. Obtaining water of high quality is an expensive business and a great deal of money has been spent. It is right that the consumers of this country should be able to rely on good quality water at all times. It is also right that they should be able to expect a proper water supply, given the willingness of Him above to rain on us in necessary quantities. We must provide both, and the amount of money that each costs is the amount of money that each costs. If one is more expensive than the other that is the way it is.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord said that the Government would throw the water <P>


<a name="column_786"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 786</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>companies to the crocodiles if there was a serious problem. I understood that the nature of privatisation was to ensure that there would be no such government control over water companies and that they could not throw them to the crocodiles. When they handed water over to the fat crocodiles who now run the industry they expected that the water problems would be resolved. Will the noble Lord now admit that the principle of the privatisation of water, which is a vital resource, was fundamentally mistaken?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, certainly not; it has gone extremely well. As the noble Lord is aware, the water companies have accepted an obligation to supply water and we have the ability to enforce that obligation.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spopq0"></A><B> Viscount Chelmsford </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they support the views expressed in the European Parliament concerning quotas for television programmes, as proposed for inclusion in the television without frontiers directive; and, if not, what action they are taking to propose a suitable alternative.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of National Heritage   (Lord Inglewood): </B>  My Lords, at the Culture and Audio-visual Council on 20th November last year all member states agreed to retain the text of Articles 4 and 5 of the 1989 television without frontiers directive. These articles require a majority of European programme content and at least 10 per cent. of that to be from independent producers. The Commission has confirmed its support of this agreement and it is not in favour of the proposed European parliamentary amendments relating to quotas.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Chelmsford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer which, if it holds, is very satisfactory. If, as we heard before the Easter Recess, the Commission is now engaged in conciliation it may not hold. Is not the use of subsidiarity a viable alternative which the Government might like to consider in such circumstances? Does the Minister agree with the comment that has been published by EURIM, the European parliamentary group of which I am a member, suggesting that public service networks provide the means to preserve national cultures with the least market distortion?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, we believe that the Commission is clearly committed to the provisions of the proposed amendments to the television without frontiers directive. It is other provisions of the European Parliament's proposed amendments about which it is considering that it may change its view. It is important to realise that this is a First Reading by the European Parliament. There is still a long way to go in the legislative process before any changes reach the statute book. Lastly, it is the case that in this country, public <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>service terrestrial broadcasters are subject to a whole range of positive programming requirements which are in the public interest.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, do the Government agree that while it is important to resist the flood of cheap American imports into some of our satellite channels, quotas are not the best way to achieve that? Will the Government ensure that during the further passage of the Broadcasting Bill in another place they will do everything possible to encourage high quality original British programming, not only from the BBC and the independent television companies but also from BSkyB?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Thomson, for supporting the Government's position in respect of quotas. Of course, it is the Government's wish that the quality of British television and television productions made in this country should be of the highest quality possible.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that quotas distort competition in the industry and, as it is an industry which must operate in a world market, quotas are bad for the broadcasting industry?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, in giving future consideration to the views expressed by the European Parliament on such matters, will the noble Lord bear in mind that most views expressed in the European Parliament are expressed on behalf of a minority only because only a minority of its members attend? Will the noble Lord give the House an assurance that he will pay due attention to that fact?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that in view of the fact that some noble Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, have been Members of the European Parliament, we can form our own views on the merits and the quality of the opinions which it forms.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord not agree that the British people will not tolerate being told by the French, the Germans, the Greeks and so on what they can and cannot watch on their television screens?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, the British people are not being told by those nations what to watch on television. They have a perfectly good on/off button.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the noble Lord, Lord Monson, is rather sanguine as to what the British people can be told about what to do and what not to do? They have just been told that they may not export perfectly good British beef to the Continent or elsewhere.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, that is a trifle wide of the Question which I have been answering but of course, on this occasion, the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, is absolutely right.

<A NAME="60418-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-02_para0"></a>What are the latest steps they have taken to combat school bullying.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Lord Henley): </B>  My Lords, The Government continue to give priority to action against bullying. We have commissioned a survey to find out how schools have used the anti-bullying pack which the Department for Education published in 1994 and the effect it has had on reducing the incidence of bullying. In addition, the Home Office published last December the report Preventing School Bullying, which to meet high demand is to be re-issued shortly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the Government's response is welcome but wholly inadequate? Research has shown that bullying is not only very damaging and distressing to many young people but it is now endemic in Britain. No fewer than 40 per cent. of our schools have no anti-bullying policy. Therefore, my guess is that many schools do not have those packs and have not bothered to obtain them. Is it not the case that the Government's mistake is to rely upon a voluntary policy when they should require all schools to have an anti-bullying policy, to report on it and to publicise locally what they are doing?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure on which research the noble Lord bases his evidence. If it is research conducted by the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations, I accept that that research shows considerable disquiet among parents and that a number of parents are unaware of schools' anti-bullying policies. However, evidence from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector seems to indicate that most schools have an effective anti-bullying policy and most have taken note of the advice given by the Department for Education and Employment in the pack which we issued some two years ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-02_para1"></a>Having said that, I very much welcome the advice of the NCPTA. It emphasises that there are no easy solutions to the problem of bullying and recommends that we should be honest and admit that it goes on and that a co-operative approach should be adopted by the Government, the LEAs, the schools, teachers and parents. Through pursuing such a policy, we may be able to eradicate the scourge of bullying.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-02_para2"></a>The noble Lord alleges that we are being complacent. We are evaluating the effectiveness of the pack. I assure him that if the evidence suggests that it would be better to issue the pack compulsorily to all schools, I should be prepared to consider that. At present, 19,000 of the 24,000 or so schools have opted to receive the pack and we have written to all the other schools which have not received it suggesting that it is available and that they might like to acquire it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Annan: </B>   My Lords, is not all this talk of an anti-bullying policy merely a platitude? We are all <P>


<a name="column_789"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 789</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>against bullying. All LEA schools are against bullying. It is very easy to talk about a policy but it is surveillance which is required. That means either that extra staff must be employed or that teachers must be required to give up what is sometimes a very well-earned break during the morning's proceedings.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, like the NCPTA, I do not believe that there is a single, simple solution to the problem. But the noble Lord is right to say that better surveillance needs to be adopted by the schools and it is for the schools to adopt the right policies to make sure that bullying is dealt with; that people are aware of it; and that there is no fear in relation to reporting incidents of bullying.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, following on the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Annan, is the Minister aware of the great admiration that we have on these Benches for the excellent report issued by the Home Office from the University of Sheffield on this subject? I declare an interest as an honorary doctor and former professor of that great university. Will the Minister inform the House what evidence has been gathered since that report on how teachers are evaluating bullying problems in their schools, because to do so teachers need time? Given the general cutback in education services, have teachers had enough time fully to implement the anti-bullying measures effectively?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, as I made clear earlier, we are evaluating the effectiveness of the pack. We shall have to look at how teachers are managing the problem of bullying. I also give an assurance to the noble Lord that for the truancy and disaffected pupils programme, there was made available some &#163;15 million last year and a similar figure will be made available this year. This is certainly something which we take very seriously indeed.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Harding of Petherton: </B>   My Lords, is not the simple answer that teachers will have to be present at playtime--I understand that sometimes that is not the case--because that is when bullying takes place? As the noble Lord, Lord Annan, said, surely that is a simple answer. I do not believe that all the surveys and so on achieve anything.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, that is one simple answer, but many other issues must be addressed. It is for schools to develop the right policies within their schools to make sure that the problem is dealt with.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Tonypandy: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister not aware that overwhelmingly the teaching profession is doing its best to stamp out bullying? Any good teacher will have his eyes and ears open. But sometimes youngsters hide the fact that they are being bullied from the teachers. Perhaps I may add that the noble Lord who did so well in Sheffield was my pupil once upon a time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, and I am sure that the noble Lord was very well taught indeed. The noble Viscount is right to draw attention to the excellent work that <P>


<a name="column_790"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 790</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>teachers are doing. But I believe that he is right also to draw attention to the fact that the right atmosphere must be created in schools so that children who are being bullied feel able to report that bullying or so that other children who know that bullying is taking place are able to report that too.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I am as much against platitudes as the noble Lord, Lord Annan, but the fact remains that bullying is creating enormous distress to many thousands of pupils in this country? Similarly, I do not agree with my noble friend in his statement that all teachers are trying to stop bullying, because there is evidence that some teachers could not care less. It is their indifference which is creating part of the problem. I agree that there is no simple solution, but until the Government really insist that every school has an anti-bullying policy, we shall not solve the problem. It is not a simple matter; but the Government can and should do more.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I can agree up to a point with the noble Lord. However, I think that he overemphasises the problem. I believe that a great deal is being done and that attitudes in schools are improving and doing so quite dramatically. As I said, some 19,000 copies of the pack have gone out to schools and, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector made clear, most schools have adopted effective policies. But obviously we would want to evaluate the effectiveness of the pack and, as I assured the noble Lord, when we have evaluated it I shall consider whether we ought to go further.

<P>
<UL>What were the reasons given by the rail passenger franchising director for his resignation last week.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Transport   (Viscount Goschen): </B>  My Lords, in his statement, Mr. Roger Salmon said that when he first took up the job of franchising director he set himself a number of objectives, including the creation of an effective franchising organisation, paving the way for capital investment in infrastructure and rolling stock. Once those objectives had been achieved, he would hand over to someone else. Mr. Salmon has now achieved the objectives and has therefore decided to stand down in October.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. However, it was my understanding that when Mr. Salmon was first appointed in April 1994 he was set the target of having 51 per cent. by value of the passenger franchises let within two years. He achieved 17 per cent., which is exactly one-third. Mr. Watts, the Minister for Railways and Roads, said on Mr. Salmon's leaving:

<a name="column_791"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 791</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Is that the wrong kind of wave, or something, when he only achieved one-third of the target? Can the Minister say whether it is more likely that Mr. Salmon became thoroughly fed up with continuing government interference, the changes and the hassle that have taken place in what many of us believe was an impossible job in any event? Indeed, is it possible that he has decided to spend more time with his merchant bank?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord should look at what has actually been achieved. There is absolutely no point in setting a target if it is an easy one. Indeed, one has to have a tough target. It might well be the view of the Opposition to set very easy targets, but we believe that if you have a tough target you will then reach it. I should point out that 60 per cent. of the passenger railway is either for sale or has been sold. Seventeen per cent. of the railway is already running; a further three franchises at 18 per cent. have been awarded and will begin running in the private sector in the near future; and a further eight franchises--25 per cent. of the passenger railway revenue--are already on the market. I believe that that is a significant achievement. We are talking about a major change to the way that we run our railways. There are major benefits for the customer and for the taxpayer. I know that today it has been reinforced that the party opposite does not care.

<A NAME="60418-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend the Minister agree that regret at the departure of the franchising director is considerably tempered by his persistent refusal to take the slightest notice of the amendment passed in this House? I wonder whether my noble friend can shed any light on the question of whether the franchising director was exercising his own discretion or whether he was responding to a powerful nudge from elsewhere.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm that when the Government decided to accelerate the process of privatisation from four to two years it meant that the funds which had originally been planned on a four-year basis in the short and medium term became inadequate to do the job properly? Can the Minister confirm that one of the reasons why Mr. Salmon resigned was that he could not complete the task that he had originally set for himself? If the Government find a new franchising director he would, of course, be on a short-term contract. Can the Minister say whether more money would be available to enable him to carry out the job that Mr. Salmon thought he would be able to do?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, the funds available are perfectly adequate. Indeed, I would say that the franchising director has done a very good job. He has not been given any directions by Ministers to accelerate the franchising programme, as the noble Lord said. On the one hand, the noble Lord said that we are behind; on the other, he said that we are speeding up the process. He cannot have it both ways.

However, is the Minister aware of the very deep level of cynicism on the part of rail users--and, in particular, of rail-user groups--concerning the likely effect of franchising in terms of the quality of service, and especially the level of investment? Is the Minister further aware that some franchise holders also have difficulty understanding how they will be able to produce the right level of investment on a seven-year franchise to substantially increase the attractiveness of rail travel to the user?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-03_spnew15"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I do not recognise cynicism among rail users although I recognise it among certain groups and the parties opposite who are trying to oppose the programme. We believe that those who are actually travelling on the lines that have been franchised are seeing the benefits of better service. They have heard the promises of further investment by the new franchisees. They know about Network South Central, the most recent franchise, and a further &#163;10 million investment promised in refurbishing trains, rolling stock and stations. Those are the things that matter to the people who travel on the railway and, indeed, to the taxpayer who will now pay substantially less by way of grant or subsidy to the railway than he did before. With the Network South Central franchise, for example, the average subsidy will be less than half it was under BR.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the present prohibition on the possession and sale of salmon roe was established in legislation over 100 years ago. Like much of the salmon legislation of the day, it was forward looking and was designed as a conservation measure to protect wild salmon stocks. Thus under the terms of Section 18 of the Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act 1868 it is a criminal offence in Scotland to buy, sell, expose for sale or have in one's possession salmon roe whatever the source of that roe.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para1"></a>What our predecessors, far-sighted as they were, did not foresee was the development of the farmed salmon industry. That industry now has a first sale value of between &#163;200 million and &#163;250 million per annum. It is a major employer in the remoter areas of the country, is a large exporter and produces a product of high quality. Unfortunately, the all-embracing ban on the possession of salmon roe for sale is preventing the salmon farming industry developing a quite lucrative market for roe, estimated at &#163;12 million per annum initially.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para2"></a>This deregulation measure will allow the farmed salmon sector to sell surplus roe and to compete in the world market with supplies from Norway, for example. What the measure will not do, the Government are confident, is to undermine the protection of the wild salmon. It will be an offence to possess wild roe for <P>


<a name="column_794"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 794</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sale. The proposed amendment in the deregulation order has been drafted carefully to ensure that that is the case. With these assurances that wild salmon roe will continue to be protected, may I recommend to the House that this deregulation order should be adopted to allow roe of farmed origin to be sold. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, in respect of this order I feel rather like a midwife who has assisted at the birth of a baby. About 18 months ago I discovered that salmon farms in Scotland were prohibited from selling their roe under Section 18 of the 1868 Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act. As a result, as the noble Earl has just said, they were losing a lucrative export market, mainly in the Far East. As a result of this discovery a nice short Private Member's Bill was drafted and I was all set to introduce it in this House when I was told that the Lord President of the Council had said that no time could be found for it in another place and that the same result could be achieved more simply by an order under the deregulation Act. Of course I accepted that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para4"></a>I believe that the safeguards against the sale of wild salmon roe are adequate. I am persuaded that placing the onus of proof of provenance on the possessor will prove satisfactory.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para5"></a>I am glad that the baby, small as it is, has at last been born. I look forward to being able to buy home grown salmon roe--which makes delicious pate--in Scotland instead of having to buy imported salmon roe in London and drag it home. I strongly recommend it to any of your Lordships who have not yet tasted it.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I have one simple question for the Minister. How will anyone determine the difference between wild salmon roe and farmed salmon roe?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-04_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, first I shall deal with the good question put by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell. Basically the burden of proof will be on the person who is holding the salmon roe to show the origin of the salmon roe. As one can probably imagine, it is somewhat difficult to show the difference between salmon roe from farmed salmon and salmon roe from wild salmon. However, we shall of course monitor the situation to see how the order affects the industry. I thank the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, for her contribution. I hope that she enjoys purchasing salmon roe in Scotland, and enjoys it at home. I commend the order to the House.

Before Clause 1, insert the following new clause--

(". The purposes of this Part are to enable a local housing authority to ensure the review, improvement and renewal as appropriate of the private sector housing in its area in such a way that in can--
<BR>
(a) set priorities for action under this Part;
<BR>
(b) bring about an improvement in the condition of private housing in the area; and
<BR>
(c) encourage the promotion and facilitation of sound maintenance of private sector housing by private interests including lenders, insurers and builders.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the House will be aware that Part I deals with renovation grants for private housing. The House will also be aware that there were extensive discussions in Committee about the difference between a mandatory scheme for renovation grants and a discretionary scheme which is now proposed under the Bill before your Lordships. Without wishing to repeat what has been said at Second Reading and in Committee, I would just point out that public intervention as regards the condition of private housing for those who are unable to maintain their own houses with their own means has been undertaken since the time of Queen Victoria, but public investment in renovation grants has fallen to around a third of the levels in the early 1980s.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para9"></a>Furthermore, as I said on Second Reading, there is a deepening and frequently underestimated crisis of disrepair in private housing. One in 12 homes--that is 1.5 million homes--are officially unfit for human habitation. Furthermore, public intervention at current levels is failing to keep pace with the rate of deterioration in private housing. Economic and demographic factors have exacerbated the problems facing private house renewal and the current house renovation grant system introduced by the Government in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 is, in our view, in a state of crisis.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para10"></a>The Government's response to this crisis has been dominated by the need to dismantle the mandatory grant which they set up in their own Act in 1989 rather than to address the underlying problems of disrepair. If implemented in its current form without the amendment that I am proposing, the Bill will remove the current right to a grant to ensure that a home is fit to live in. The Bill provides no national framework within which local authorities may address the current disrepair in private housing. The Bill will officially sanction housing which is unfit for human occupation by legalising the deferral of action on those properties. The Bill will do nothing to bring in any extra resources needed to halt the deterioration--which is before our eyes--in the condition of private housing.

<A NAME = "60418-04_para11"></a>Having said that--this is part of what we discussed in Committee--I should like to speak particularly to the amendment that I put before your Lordships this afternoon. The proposed "purpose" clause--in Committee we discussed the nature of purpose clauses, and I do not accept the argument that a purpose clause overrides all that is in the Bill subsequently--which I set before your Lordships is designed to clarify the intention behind the Bill by setting a framework for the operation of local authority discretion. Local authorities should, in our view, be enabled to set priorities for action to tackle private house disrepair. I cannot imagine that your Lordships will consider that to be contentious. Indeed it is precisely the purpose to which the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, referred at Second Reading when he said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It will give local authorities the freedom to decide their own priorities for tackling unfitness and disrepair in private housing".--[Official Report, 20/2/96; col. 976.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
My amendment will provide what we believe to be a useful curb upon the discretion the measure gives both to local authorities and to the Secretary of State. If local authorities do not use their discretion in the way required by this amendment they will be contravening the Bill's essential purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para12"></a>Equally, if the implementation of the Bill and the wealth of accompanying secondary legislation that we predict as a result of the Bill gaining Royal Assent prevent local authorities from establishing priorities in the way envisaged, we believe that the Bill's purpose will be frustrated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para13"></a>The purpose of public intervention in private house renewal should be to bring about an improvement in private house conditions. That is set out in paragraph (b) of the amendment. I do not believe that this is a matter of dispute. Given the discretionary nature of the Bill's provisions, the widespread impression, which I accept, that the Government are abandoning responsibility to make proper arrangements for the maintenance of private housing, and the suspicion that the end of mandatory grant will be followed by a reduction in public expenditure on private house renewal, this part of the amendment may not be self evident. It is designed to establish a principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para14"></a>If the grant system is to operate successfully, it must encourage the sound maintenance of private housing in co-operation with private interests. We recognise that private interests will be involved. It is right that they should be involved in all aspects of private housing. It is odd that the Government, who are so committed to the advancement of the private sector, have not paid more attention to the role of the private sector in private house renewal. We believe that paragraph (c) of the amendment puts down a marker for private and public sector co-operation in private house renewal.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-04_para15"></a>I am aware of the arguments put forward in Committee about purpose clauses. However, because the Bill marks a major change from a mandatory grant to a discretionary system for 1.5 million private houses in disrepair, I believe that a purpose clause for Part I is the right way to go forward. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60418-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, made much of the fact that the Bill <P>


<a name="column_797"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 797</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contains discretionary provisions and does not provide resources for their implementation. I believe that it will be easy for my noble friend to resist the amendment if he so wishes, as I imagine he does. Had that amendment been put into the Bill by the Government, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, would find it difficult to resist the temptation to put down an amendment to remove the provision in the following terms. He would say that the Bill provides only discretionary provisions; it includes no resources; and, therefore, it declares a purpose which cannot possibly be achieved in the first clause because that clause is discretionary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para0"></a>The noble Lord says that the purposes of this part of the Bill are enabling and do not place a requirement on a local housing authority. If a discretionary motive is a weakness in the Bill, it is reflected and multiplied in the amendment. I hope that my noble friend will resist it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment because I read the clause in a way diametrically opposed to the interpretation of the noble Lord, Lord Elton.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para1"></a>The concern widely shared among many noble Lords, and outside the House, is that the Bill is an elaborate scheme to mask the inadequacy of funding for house renovation, repair and so on. If there is not enough money then there must be a strategy for using such funding as is available.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para2"></a>During Committee we heard much of the discretion in local authorities. I find it difficult to accept that there would be a discretion both in the context of inadequate funding and as regards the centralising provisions of the Bill. However, if there is to be discretion at local level, then it is appropriate--I believe that it is required--that local authorities are enabled to review, improve and renew private sector housing in the way set out in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para3"></a>The amendment sets the discretionary nature of the scheme in a way which supports what the Government say the Bill provides--although I do not read the Bill as providing that. It is not enough to say that grants will be available when there is inadequate funding for those grants with no possibility of setting strategies for priorities or for using that money in the best way. The best role for local government is to encourage investment in maintenance and improvement and to play an active part in the best use of the funds available.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para4"></a>I set very high in that strategy the use of funds, in the private rented sector as well as privately owned property, where conditions may be particularly poor. Given the problems to which the noble Lord, Lord Williams, alluded, I believe that it is the responsibility of local authorities to do everything possible to ensure that people have a decent roof over their heads. This purpose clause would set that framework.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, in supporting my noble friend's amendment, I take a slightly different tack from previous speakers. It is becoming recognised that through the Bill we are in the process of changing the regime for housing renovation grants from a <P>


<a name="column_798"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 798</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mandatory to a discretionary one. However, one of my concerns is as regards how those new discretionary housing renovation grant schemes will work at local housing authority level, and how they will change over time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para5"></a>Perhaps I may postulate a couple of scenarios. The local authority may have few houses in such a situation. It may be a local authority with a lot of relatively new build. It may have had a high proportion of council houses and, therefore, may not have a large number of dwellings in the category likely to attract grant because of the decline in that sector of the housing market. In that situation, there is a risk that because the issue affects only a minority of people in the area, the local authority will say, "This is not a high political priority; we shall not spend a great deal of money in that area and we shall restrict giving grants as much as possible".
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para6"></a>I would hope that a purpose clause might be used only in extremis. There might be a small pocket of decline in the private housing sector which needs grants but the local authority takes little notice of it. That sector could go to the court and say, "This local authority is not abiding by the Act". That is an example of one use that might be made of the new clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para7"></a>The other point is in relation to the ongoing dynamic situation. As circumstances change in a local authority area, there will be a need to adjust and readjust the priorities that a local authority may set. For example, it may decide to allocate more funds to a particular council activity. It may decide to change the criteria on which the funds were allocated. Surely, given the nature of the democracy that we have in this country, it is only right that local councillors making the decisions should be responsive to their local communities. They should have in front of them reports on how such a scheme might operate, what the effect would be on the operation of schemes that previously had certain criteria attached to them and whether they were effective in terms of the final section of the amendment to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"encourage the promotion and facilitation of sound maintenance of private sector housing", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
by the private sector. It may be that, because of the way the local authority grant discretionary regime operates, it is not working to best advantage in bringing forward private sector investment in maintenance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para8"></a>It is important that local authorities are, if not required then encouraged, to examine their schemes for discretionary disbursement of public funds for private sector renewal and maintenance. They should be responsive to the local situation as it changes. I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to the purpose clause and accept the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-05_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, at Second Reading and at Committee stage I crossed swords with the noble Lord, Lord Williams, because I welcomed the discretionary nature of the Bill's provisions. I approve <P>


<a name="column_799"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 799</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the concept of a discretionary scheme rather than the mandatory one which it replaces. I gave my opposition to that at Committee stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para9"></a>I believe that it is an unusual approach for the noble Lord, Lord Williams, to take to put down and now to pursue at Report stage this purpose clause. On many occasions I have crossed swords with him about the restrictions that the Government have placed on the actions or activities of local authorities. He suggested to me that he disapproved of governments putting restrictions on local authorities and their activities. That indicates that the noble Lord does not believe that he can trust local authorities to exercise their judgment correctly. Therefore, they need an overarching purpose clause. I do not believe that this one will necessarily have the effect which he suggests and I agree with my noble friend Lord Elton that, although it creates a good feeling, it will not alter the amount of resources available for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para10"></a>In supporting the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, then argued very much against it. He indicated that one should leave the local authority to use its discretion to react to the different priorities as time goes by. That is exactly what the Bill does; it leaves local authorities to judge for themselves how the money should be spent, rather than the mandatory scheme which it replaces. Therefore, I urge my noble friend on the Front Bench to reject it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Viscount sits down, I believe that he misunderstood what I was suggesting. I was trying to suggest that the local authority would be required to consider changes to the scheme, not that it should not have the discretion. The local authority should have the discretion but should use it effectively.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment on the grounds that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, mentioned in the early part of his remarks. As he said, successive national house condition surveys have shown that no fewer than 1.5 million houses are unfit for human habitation in the country and 3.5 million are in need of serious repair. At the same time, the grants being made available for dealing with the situation, which obviously affect mainly people on low income, have been rapidly diminishing. It is my opinion that the drafting of this part of the Bill does not sufficiently emphasise the importance of the problem. I believe that this purpose clause or something similar would help to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para11"></a>The fact that we have limited resources does not in any way diminish--indeed, it increases--the size of the problem. We ought to make that clear. There ought to be an incentive for this Government or successive governments to make additional resources available and for local authorities to make the best use of those resources. I should have thought that some reference to it in the Bill is necessary.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, noble Lords spoke eloquently on Amendment No. 1--notably the noble Lord, Lord Williams--about the importance to a local authority of being able to identify the needs of the <P>


<a name="column_800"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 800</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>private housing sector in its area, to provide help for those who own, rent or let properties which are unfit or in need of repair and to encourage maintenance. We do not disagree about the general desirability of those principles.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para12"></a>However, as my noble friend Lord Ferrers said in Committee, my noble friend Lord Elton said today and I repeat, we do not believe that a general purpose clause of any nature is necessary or appropriate in the Bill. As drafted, Part I of the Bill deals not with overarching principles but with detailed provisions on the workings of grant regimes. It provides local authorities with the powers they need to meet the objectives of their private sector renewal strategies. How these are used is for a local authority to decide.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para13"></a>I do not believe that there is a need in the Bill to encapsulate fundamental guiding principles which are necessary to guide the courts in the exercise of their functions. Purpose clauses are extremely rare in English and Welsh legislation, with only the Family Law Reform Bill, the Arbitration Bill and the Legal Aid Act 1988 coming to mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para14"></a>A general purpose clause for Part I would run the risk of interfering with the legal clarity of the individual provisions in the rest of Part I. We already have a general statement at the beginning of each of Chapters I to IV of Part I explaining what the particular grant or purpose is for. There is no need to go any further with general principles which are not closely and directly related to the individual provisions and which run the risk of making interpretation of the legislation more difficult, with the possibility of upsetting conventional interpretation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para15"></a>Part I of the Bill sets out the powers, duties and obligations of a local authority in terms of assistance and action where a person is unable to improve or adapt his property. Care has been taken to ensure that these cases are set out clearly and in detail to ensure that the provisions are applied on a consistent basis nationally and are not open to misinterpretation. I do not believe the amendment would improve the ability of authorities to achieve the purposes of the legislation. On the contrary, it would risk limiting their activities to those falling within the purposes set out in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para16"></a>The objectives the noble Lord, Lord Williams, seeks to include in this purpose clause include the normal practices that we would all expect a local authority to undertake as part of its wider housing strategy and as part of the housing investment programme process. But some of the purposes set out in the clause, such as setting priorities for action and encouraging and facilitating sound maintenance, are not found in the express provisions of Part I. However, the latter are purposes that the department recognises and seeks to encourage through guidance, with such publications as the Housing Strategies Guide and the annual Housing Investment Programme Guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-05_para17"></a>We are strongly of the opinion that there is no room for a purpose clause at the beginning of this part of the Bill. It adds nothing, it carries dangers with it and, as my noble friend Lord Ullswater said, we trust local <P>

<P>
<A NAME="60418-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, will he clear my mind of the confusion in which I find myself, which I admit happens from time to time? I thought he said that general purpose clauses were unusual. He may well be right. However, he said that there was a general purpose clause in the Arbitration Bill, which completed its passage in this House and is now in another place. The Arbitration Bill reappears in Part II of this Bill, albeit in another context from the one with which we are dealing here. It occurs to me that if general purpose clauses are appropriate in the Arbitration Bill, which appears later in this Bill, why is it not appropriate to insert a general purpose clause at this stage of the Bill?
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-06_para0"></a>I may be totally wrong and the Minister may be able to clear up the confusion with which my mind is clouded. If it is, I should be greatly pleased if he would uncloud it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I acknowledge my ability to confuse the noble Lord. Indeed, at a previous stage of the Bill I remember confusing his gender! I hope I have not gone so far this time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-06_para1"></a>The difference is surely that some Bills benefit from purpose clauses and others do not. Our general experience is that the numbers that do are quite few and far between. So far as this particular part of the Bill is concerned, we set out the purposes relevant to each individual section of the part, but we see no room for a purpose clause for the part as a whole.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords who spoke to this amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said that he had mistaken my noble friend's gender in a previous discussion. He also mistook my noble friend's name in a letter that he very kindly wrote to me. So I am not sure whether my noble friend Lord Howie speaks as a male, a female or a member of some curious body that I know not of--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   My Lords, I wonder if I might help my noble friend. I have been a Member of this House, give or take a day or two, for 18 years. I know that the noble Lord is much more recent than I am. I daresay I am an antiquity--less so than some, but an antiquity of a sort. At an earlier stage of the Bill, he accused me of being the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. To a point, I was quite pleased about that, though it caused me a certain amount of further confusion. His satellites, or whatever the word is, in Whitehall sent me a letter in which they called me "Will Troon". I thought that very gracious. The "Will" bit was obviously meant to be kindly; and the "Troon" bit was part of my origin. All I can say is that if I am confused, the noble Lord is confused as well.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may continue my wind-up on this amendment. I am grateful <P>


<a name="column_802"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 802</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to my noble friend for his admission. I hope very much that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, will not feel offended by my noble friend's remark.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-06_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in responding, said that basically the Government agree with all this. I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Elton, had read the text of the amendment. If I had said, "require a local housing authority", then I agree with the noble Lord that I should have been introducing what was fundamentally a wrecking amendment. I am not doing so. I am trying to set a framework.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-06_para3"></a>That leads me to the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater. I have every trust in local authorities. That is not my problem; it is a problem that the Government have. They have no trust in local authorities at all--witness all the machinations of the revenue support grant, SSA and so on. I have trust in local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-06_para4"></a>Nevertheless, I believe that there must be--I use the noble Lord's words--some over-arching principle in relation to renovation grants for private housing up and down the land. The amendment is only enabling, but it gives a guide to local housing authorities as to what they could or should be doing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-06_para5"></a>So far as resources are concerned, the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is right. When we come to the subject of efficiency grants we shall no doubt discuss the question of resources again. The point about paragraph (c) is that we are interested in getting private interests involved in this business, as indeed the Government are. I have no problem with that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-06_para6"></a>As for the purpose clause, as my noble friend Lord Howie--in whatever identity he chooses to present himself--pointed out, there are circumstances where a purpose clause is desirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-06_para7"></a>Fundamentally, this is a question of political difference between noble Lords opposite and ourselves. The only way to solve political difference is to ask the opinion of the House.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 10, leave out ("Grants are available from local housing authorities") and insert ("Local housing authorities may make grants").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment seeks to amend the first line of the first clause of the first part of the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said in our earlier discussion, there is a general statement at the start of each part. My amendment seeks to replace the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Grants are available from local housing authorities", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
which seem to me to be something of a purpose statement, if not a complete purpose clause. The phrase is descriptive but I am not convinced of its accuracy. It is not accurate because, as I said in the previous discussion, we all accept that funding for grants is, sadly, inadequate. Moreover, it does not describe the provisions which follow in this clause, because it does not reflect the discretion vested in local authorities, as we discussed. It reads as though the position is mandatory.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para1"></a>Therefore, the amendment will replace those words and the subsection will read,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Local housing authorities may make grants in accordance with this Chapter towards the cost of works", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
which are then listed. We seek to provide for that local flexibility which throughout the Committee stage of the Bill the Government said they endorsed. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I must admit at the outset that the amendment has caused us a great deal of <P>


<a name="column_805"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 805</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>confusion and speculation. We did not realise at all what it was for and certainly the speech of the noble Baroness came as a complete surprise to me. We think that we are likely to be of the opinion that the amendment is inappropriate and confusing. But, having heard the noble Baroness's lucid explanation, we should like to have time to think about the amendment before Third Reading. I shall write to her.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry not to have heard a speech in response to what I might have said. That might have given me more material for Third Reading. It would be ungracious to refuse the noble Lord's offer. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para2"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 16, after ("building,") insert--
<BR>
("( ) the provision of facilities on a mandatory basis for disabled persons where properties are unfit,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment stands in the name of my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel and myself. The House has already discussed this afternoon the Government's reluctance to move away from discretionary grants and toward mandatory grants. The purpose of the amendment is to confirm that there is one group of persons--disabled persons--for whom the need to live in decent, fit accommodation is so important that there cannot sensibly be an element of discretion. Local authorities should have a mandatory basis for making such grants.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para4"></a>Many disabled people are elderly but by no means all of them. Disabled people suffer far greater disadvantage than the rest of the population. It seems entirely proper that a local authority should make grants available in order that those people may live in fit accommodation. Of course, nobody should live in accommodation which is not adequate and proper. But the burden of living in substandard accommodation is that much greater for disabled persons.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para5"></a>There are the effects of dampness, for example. If a house is unfit, it may well be damp, with clear and obvious detriment to the health of those living within such property. An unfit building may be cold. It may not be properly insulated and perhaps does not have an adequate heating system. Again, that represents a danger to the health of the persons living there. If those persons are disabled and have less mobility, or are elderly and disabled, then the effect on them of cold is so much the worse. It is clear, and there is a lot of evidence to show, that when people who are disabled live in unfit accommodation, it has an effect on their mental as well as their physical health.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para6"></a>Many of the people who would benefit from the amendment may also be receiving support from the local authority in terms of social services or community care. If the aim of government policy is to enable people to live in their own homes for as long as possible before they move into residential care, it clearly makes sense to ensure that those homes are properly fit. The day when an elderly or disabled person has to move into <P>


<a name="column_806"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 806</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>residential care will then be that much longer delayed. In fact, financial savings will be made through that process.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para7"></a>We have already heard of the large number of people that would be potentially affected by the amendment. In an earlier amendment many noble Lords referred to the statistics. It is worrying that perhaps one home in six in Britain requires urgent repairs costing over &#163;1,000 to bring it into a fit state. We know that many of those homes are occupied by elderly or younger disabled persons.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para8"></a>There is therefore a clear argument for saying that the needs of the group of people about which I am talking are so great and their well-being so critically affected by living in substandard accommodation that it is right and proper that there should be a mandatory basis for grants to ensure that their homes are in a fit condition. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_time0"></A><H5>4.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Finsberg: </B>   My Lords, on the face of it this is a difficult amendment to oppose and everybody must have immense sympathy for the disabled people concerned. But we must analyse what we are being asked to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para9"></a>It appears to me that we are having a virtual re-run of the arguments on Amendment No. 1. If one looks at the amendment, many of the factors are applicable also to ordinary elderly people rather than just elderly disabled people. And is not a single mother with children living under those conditions equally likely to suffer? I do not believe it to be equitable to put forward one category and ignore everybody else. We must say either that all grants should be mandatory--for the reasons given by my noble friend the Minister that is not on--or we must say that they are all discretionary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para10"></a>In the argument put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, he said that many disabled people may well be receiving benefits from the local authority. In that case, I should have thought that the local authority would use its discretion. Though one has the greatest sympathy for the argument, the case is not made out for singling out one category of people.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, in rising to support my noble friend Lord Dubs in his amendment, I must admit that I sympathise with the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Finsberg. However, my understanding of the Bill is that it is the Government's policy--it comes up later in the Bill--that disabled persons should receive mandatory grants for their needs. The discretionary element of the new regime will only apply to those grants that are not for disabled people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para11"></a>One of the difficulties is the lack of clarity on the face of the Bill. Amendment No. 3 seeks to ensure that, right up front, within the first clause of the Bill, we provide some clarity about the mandatory nature of grants for disabled people. I had a degree of sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and her Amendment No. 2. I did not speak on it because I thought the Government would accept it--they appeared to understand the sense of it. Judging from what the Minister said, and given the explanation by the noble <P>


<a name="column_807"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Baroness, the Government are considering how to react to what is a sensible suggestion. I hope therefore that they will react even more positively to the amendment moved by my noble friend which effectively seeks to clarify, on the face of the Bill, what I believe is already government policy and what we are concerned with in determining this first part of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-07_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, I have a great deal of sympathy for the sentiments behind Amendment No. 3. As my noble friend Lord Finsberg said, I do not believe that anybody on this side of the House would quarrel with those sentiments. However, Clause 24 of the Bill provides for what the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, seeks.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para12"></a>Clause 24 spells out facilities for disabled people in some detail and those are the ones that must be granted. If there are others about which the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, is very keen, then perhaps an amendment should be made to Clause 24 rather than this overarching form of amendment at this early stage of this part of the Bill. If my reading of the Bill is correct--and I may easily be wrong--I hope that my noble friend will resist the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-07_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment. As I read it, it is quite narrow, but important. Not only does it limit the mandatory grants to disabled persons, but also it only applies to a case where the property in question is "unfit".
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para13"></a>I believe the amendment is important. The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, referred to the ill-health which frequently--not invariably, but frequently--accompanies disability. Clause 24, to which the noble Viscount referred, lists many improvements and alterations which will become part of the mandatory regime. But that clause does not extend to making a house fit so that it does not fall within the definition of a house that is unfit for occupation, which is the terminology used in the provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-07_para14"></a>I take the noble Viscount's point that perhaps the right place for the amendment is in Clause 24. But it is a sad indictment of our society if we cannot see our way to make provision so that accommodation is not unfit (and not being unfit does not necessarily mean very fit) as well as providing for the specific alterations. I support the noble Lord, Lord Dubs.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, again I find myself in some confusion. This time it is as a result of the confusion of others who have spoken. The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, attributes effects to the amendment which we do not find in it and misses out on effects that we do find in it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-08_para0"></a>Most of the matters addressed by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, belong more properly to the argument on Amendment No. 14. I would happily join in were it not for the continued absence of my noble friend Lord Swinfen. I do not wish to trouble the House twice with those arguments and if the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, will allow me, I will reserve them for the later amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-08_para1"></a>Clause 1 is an introductory clause and sets out in general terms the grants that are available under Chapter 1. The purposes for which grant may be given <P>


<a name="column_808"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 808</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are described in more detail for each separate type of grant, together with the matters for which the local authority must have regard in considering an application. The purposes and matters to be taken into account in respect of a disabled facilities grant are described in Clauses 24 and 25 of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-08_para2"></a>Amendment No. 3 seeks to make disabled facilities grant mandatory, even where the dwelling is unfit for human habitation. Amendment No. 4 is consequential.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-08_para3"></a>Clause 25 requires that a local housing authority, when proposing to approve an application for disabled facilities grant, should consider whether the dwelling is fit for human habitation. Where it is not, the authority has the power under subsection (5) of Clause 25 to treat the application as an application for a discretionary grant, even where it would otherwise be mandatory.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-08_para4"></a>Clause 1 does not contain the power to give grant. It merely acts as an introduction in describing in general terms the purposes for which grant may be given. As a result, the noble Lord's amendment would be unlikely to be held by a court to override the detailed provisions to the contrary in Clause 25(5) on the same issue. We therefore believe that the amendment would in practice be ineffective.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-08_para5"></a>To turn to the genuine concerns of the noble Lord in tabling this amendment, we have given considerable thought to the link between fitness standards and the needs of disabled people. We are aware that the present link, which exists under the 1989 Act, has deterred some disabled people from applying for grant for essential adaptations to their homes, because they wish to avoid the disturbance caused by major renovation works. We therefore considered that it should be left to the discretion of the local authority, which is aware of the condition and circumstances of both the applicant and of the dwelling, to consider whether the condition of the property is likely to be a threat to the health and safety of the occupant and, therefore, that the adaptations should not be carried out unless works are also undertaken to bring the property up to an acceptable standard.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-08_para6"></a>We shall be issuing guidance to local authorities on the treatment of applications for disabled facilities grant involving works to a property that does not meet the fitness standards. I hope that on consideration the noble Lord will feel that that is sufficient to allow him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I thank those noble Lords who have taken part in the discussion on this amendment. I note that the noble Lord, Lord Finsberg, in arguing ultimately against the amendment put up a pretty good case for the first amendment discussed this afternoon; namely, that all the grants should be mandatory and not just those for disabled persons living in unfit property.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Finsberg: </B>   My Lords, I wish to make it clear that I supported my noble friend the Minister in opposing the idea.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I can see that, ultimately, the noble Lord did, but in the process of arriving at his <P>


<a name="column_809"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 809</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>conclusion I thought for one moment--just for one moment--that he was going to come out in favour of mandatory grants for all people. However, in the end, he went back to supporting the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-08_para7"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, made clear in reply to the point about Clause 24, Clause 24 has a different aim. Clause 24 seeks to adapt fit properties, or properties that are presumably fit, for use for disabled persons to enable them to go on living there. This amendment is quite different. The amendment says that if a disabled person is living in an unfit property it is right and proper that there should be a mandatory basis for providing grants to make that property fit for the disabled person to live in. That is surely a very wide point.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-08_para8"></a>The Minister sought to meet the point a little by suggesting that guidance would subsequently be issued. I am not persuaded by that. Guidance would be helpful, but to have the proposition clearly stated on the face of the Bill is proper and sends out the right signal in terms of our concern for disabled people. I would much rather have the point on the face of the Bill than simply in guidance which the department will later issue without any parliamentary scrutiny. In the circumstances, I think it would be right, given the division of opinion, to seek the opinion of the House.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-08_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord seeks the opinion of the House, he is indicating that even if a house were defective the grants would have to be made.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, what I am seeking to do is to establish the proposition that disabled persons should, above all others, not have to live in unfit property. If the House were to go along with that proposition, it might well be that subsequently other changes could be made. However, the general proposition should be on the face of the Bill. It is on that proposition that I seek the opinion of the House.

[Amendment No. 4 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-08_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960418/text/60418-09.htm"/>

<P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 1, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Grants for home improvement agencies </B></center><BR>
(".--(1) Grants may be made available in accordance with this Chapter through home improvement agencies.
<BR>
(2) Local housing authorities may contribute to the establishment and running of home improvement agencies through funds which would otherwise be available for making grants in accordance with this Chapter.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in this amendment we return to the subject of home improvement agencies. When in Committee, we were discussing their role, the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We greatly value that work and are keen to see the services of those agencies become widely available".--[Official Report, 26/3/96; col. 1589.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I endorse that support. Home improvement agencies, often called "care and repair" or "staying put", help people who are old or who have a disability, or both, or who are living on a low income, to repair and adapt homes which are unfit or unsuitable. Their particular role is assisting people through what can often be a very daunting task in dealing with repairs and alterations, deciding what work has to be done, arranging finance and organising and overseeing the building work. I recall at Committee stage, in supporting an amendment regarding home improvement agencies, that I did so by challenging noble Lords to recall their own experience of any building work. It is generally uncomfortable to live through and difficult to organise.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para1"></a>The 200 agencies countrywide, 144 of which receive financial support from the Department of the Environment, target resources at those who are most in need. They are cost effective and have developed an expertise in identifying low-cost solutions. They contribute to the renewal of the housing stock which, whether we are saying it in a purpose clause or not, is what this Bill aims at doing. I am told that their ethos is that the services are person-centred in helping people <P>


<a name="column_812"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 812</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to undertake work they feel is important thereby assisting them to stay at home with the dignity and independence one would want to see.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para2"></a>I propose the amendment because I am concerned to ensure that the work of home improvement agencies can continue. Subsection (1) of the amendment provides that grants may be made through those agencies. Subsection (2) is to enable local authorities, if contributing to the establishment and running of the agencies--and they will have to find the funds from somewhere--to use funds which might otherwise be available for direct grants to home owners, landlords and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para3"></a>It is intended to support local strategies and discretion. A local strategy is determining how best to spend the cash available. I take the view that pump priming can often be a very good use of money, and that is the context in which I see the amendment. It is not an argument for less to be spent on repairs themselves but merely a proposal to facilitate the work of the home improvement agencies and to make the best use of the funds which are available. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness said, we discussed home improvement agencies in Committee. I share her enthusiasm and that of my noble friend Lord Ferrers for these agencies. They are small, voluntary bodies offering a personal service. We admire them greatly and, as the noble Baroness said, we support many of them. However, the noble Baroness's amendment would change the characteristics that make them so valuable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para4"></a>The amendment would do two things. First, it would enable grants to be made available through home improvement agencies. But the administration of grants is a complex business. Some aspects, such as considering the needs of individual applicants and investigating the state of the property, may well be tasks that home improvement agencies are equipped to carry out. Many authorities use HIAs as their agencies for this kind of activity. It requires no change to the Bill to enable them to go on doing so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para5"></a>However, what the noble Baroness appears to want is to enable home improvement agencies also to take on other aspects of the operation of the grant regime. Those matters are properly for the local authorities themselves--matters like the consideration of priorities; developing and carrying out strategies; the consideration of choice between deserving applicants; enforcing grant conditions, including obtaining repayments where appropriate; accounting for large amounts of grant moneys; and claiming subsidies from central government. Such matters are properly the job of accountable local authorities; HIAs are not equipped to deal with them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para6"></a>Secondly, the amendment would allow authorities to use the resources they have for undertaking private sector renewal to fund the establishment and operation of home improvement agencies. Under the present arrangements, HIAs obtain funds from various sources. I have already mentioned the subsidy which the Government pay. This meets up to half of the running costs of those agencies which are supported. Agencies obtain the remainder of their funds from other sources, <P>


<a name="column_813"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 813</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>including charitable donations and other private sector sources, but their main source is undoubtedly local authorities. Some of the support is paid in the form of direct subsidies towards administrative costs. Some is received in the form of fees for work undertaken in connection with individual grant applications.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para7"></a>What is unacceptable in the amendment is the idea that local authorities should be able to divert resources intended for use on private sector renewal activities, such as giving grants, to support the administration of HIAs. If an authority wants to support an agency because it thinks that is a good way of administering some aspect of the grant system in its area, it should meet the cost from its own resources. The annual revenue support settlement allows for administrative costs. It would be wrong to allow local authorities to use money specifically voted for private sector renewal for administration.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para8"></a>I have stressed the value that we see in home improvement agencies, but, for the reasons I have given, I do not believe that the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness would help to improve that value. Therefore, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_time0"></A><H5>5 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has raised a number of matters which require response. First, he said that the administration of grants is complex. I agree with that. However, the noble Lord makes me wonder why, since I am not proposing any change in the regime, he objects to the first part of the proposed new clause which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Grants may be made available". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I repeat that I have used the word "may". The new clause does not state that the administration of grants "shall" invariably be through home improvement agencies. It is accepted that, by and large, they are doing a good job. I am not seeking to give them the whole of the job; nor to do more than enable local authorities to continue to use a good and, I suspect, relatively cheap mechanism.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para9"></a>I turn secondly to the question of funding. The main source of funding for home improvement agencies is local authorities. I sought to raise the issue because increasingly the funds which local authorities have to spend are not raised through council tax--between 85 and 86 per cent. of local authority expenditure generally comes by way of grant--and there is an increasing tendency to ring-fence the grant which central government makes to local authorities; in other words, for the Government to say, "You can have this money, but we will tell you what to spend it on".
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para10"></a>I am concerned that the amount of money available for local authorities to use in a discretionary fashion is reducing year on year. It seems to me that it would be entirely appropriate to use money identified for home improvements in the best way and to make the best use of the administrative mechanisms which the local authority can identify, whether within or outside the local authority. The noble Lord said that it would be <P>


<a name="column_814"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 814</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wrong to use money voted for renewal on administration. I do not think that that argument holds good because the amendment specifically gives the local authority the option to choose how to use the money, so the question of voting it for a particular purpose does not arise. In any event, as we know, a certain amount of administration is always necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para11"></a>Nevertheless, I shall consider further what the noble Lord said, although he has made me more, rather than less, concerned about the issue. I shall read his words in Hansard, but for the moment I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para12"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME="60418-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 4, line 8, leave out ("proposes to acquire") and insert ("is in the process of acquiring").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 6, which stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel, I should like to speak also to Amendment No. 7. In Committee, my noble friend proposed that the phrase "proposes to acquire" should be deleted and replaced by the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the process of acquiring". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
At that point the Government undertook to consider the suggestion, and it is my purpose in moving this amendment to see what came of the Government's consideration. I fully understand that it is right and proper that, as Clause 7 suggests, before giving renovation grants there should be a commitment to acquire the property. That is provided for in Clause 7(1)(a). The same point arises--and we suggest the same change of wording--in relation to Clause 7(1)(b).
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-09_para15"></a>It seems to me that it is much clearer to say that an applicant is in the process of acquiring the property. That means that certain steps have been taken with a view to acquiring the property. Such steps are clear and can be objectively seen, but the phrase "proposes to acquire" could simply mean an intention. It could mean, "I would like to do that if I could". That seems rather vague. Local authorities would be helped by having a clearer statement than that which is currently in the Bill. Therefore, I hope that the Government will accept the amendment. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60418-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I should like to support my noble friend in this and in doing so I need to declare an interest, which I should have done at the beginning of the debate. I declared my interest in Committee in that I have submitted an application for a home improvement grant. I hope that that will be taken as my declaration of interest for the whole of this Report stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para0"></a>In rising to support my noble friend in this amendment, perhaps I may point out that one of the difficulties, which I believe the Government accept, is that it is sensible for someone who is hoping to acquire a house or is proposing to acquire a property--or however it is defined--that is, for someone who is aiming to do so, but is not yet the owner of the property, to submit a grant application. There is a whole range of <P>


<a name="column_815"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 815</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasons involved, but we are talking predominately about making a judgment as to whether it is sensible to go ahead with the project of purchasing the house, bearing in mind the individual's own resources and any resources that are likely to come from the local authority in terms of renovation grant. One has to make an assessment as to all the resources that will be available from different sources. It is sensible, therefore, to enable an application to go forward even though the applicant is not the current owner of the property.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para1"></a>Someone may intend to buy a property, but that intention may be frustrated at some point by, say, the owner turning round and saying, "I don't want to sell to you". The owner may suddenly push up the price so that the project is not viable. What is the situation of the applicant for the home improvement grant at that stage? One of things that worries me is that if we leave the wording as it is on the face of the Bill and do not amend it as my noble friend has suggested, an applicant who is in this limbo before ownership may well have the best of intentions but, because of force of circumstances, may fall foul of the Act. I would hate that to happen. Therefore, I hope that the Government will recognise that in the vast majority of cases involving home improvement grants, people will make totally legitimate bona fide applications and that they should not be held to have fallen foul of the system just because of the actions of another person who has put them on the wrong side of the law, if I may put it like that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, we have given this matter some thought since Committee. We have decided that we like things the way they are. The wording in the Bill is, at first sight, less logical than the wording of the amendment, but it is wording that was evolved by the Law Commission which has been in use in housing law since 1985 and which works well.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para2"></a>When we come to the practical effects, most of the practical advantages which would seem to be in the amendment are negated by the fact that in practice a local authority can reject an application by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, to buy Ditchingham Hall or some other great property, until he can show that he has a reasonable prospect of acquiring it. So it does not involve local authorities in unwarranted work. Its wide application allows for all sorts of means of beginning to buy a property which might in some way fall foul of the phrase "in the process of acquiring" in ways we do not yet know and in which we would prefer not to get involved because we are happy with the way things are.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para3"></a>With Amendment No. 7 there would be the additional disadvantage that it would open the door to serious abuse of the system by allowing someone to make a tenant's application, with the stated intention of living in the dwelling, when the applicant's intention is to buy the property, improve it with the benefit of grant aid, and then let it, thus evading the separate landlord's means test. We would positively dislike the effects of Amendment No. 7. With that explanation I hope that the <P>


<a name="column_816"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 816</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord will feel able to withdraw, and not press, what I accept are two amendments which are helpful even if they are not the right ones.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I was interested in relation to Amendment No. 6 to hear the Minister describe local government practice in terms of what it should be if the amendment were passed, rather than in terms of what the Bill actually says. In other words, he was saying that local authorities will interpret the clause in the way in which my amendment suggests rather than in the way it is worded.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para4"></a>In the hope that between now and Third Reading the Minister will think again, let me try him out on the use of the words in a slightly different context to highlight the point. If I were to say to him, "The Conservative Party proposes to win the next election, but the Labour Party is in the process of wining the next election", that shows that there is a marked difference between the two expressions. I do not want to force this matter any further this evening. I hope that the Minister will think again between now and Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para5"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas </B>   moved Amendment No. 8:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 5, line 27, at beginning insert ("Subject to subsection (2A),").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to government Amendment No. 9 and, with the leave of noble Lords concerned, I shall cover also Amendments Nos. 10 and 11.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para8"></a>As was indicated in Committee by my noble friend Lord Ferrers, the Government recognise that there may be individual cases or general circumstances where it will not be appropriate to require a grant applicant to have both owned and lived in a property for three years before being eligible for grant assistance. The discussion in Committee included many well made points from noble Lords for which I am grateful, and in view of those points we have looked again at this provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para9"></a>We have already included a provision in the Bill which would allow the Secretary of State to dispense with the prior qualifying condition in certain circumstances. However, in practice that would dispense with the condition for wide categories of applicants, such as for all empty properties in an authority's area.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para10"></a>We believe that it would be preferable also to allow local authorities to decide when not to require the prior qualifying condition to be met when considering individual applications. That will allow local authorities to develop clear strategies against which an individual application can be measured and a decision made.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para11"></a>Therefore, we have brought forward Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 which give local authorities the discretion they need to dispense with the prior qualifying period generally or for particular cases or for certain types of case.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para12"></a>With his Amendment No. 11 the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, seeks to achieve a similar effect. However, the amendments I have just described go wider than the noble Lord's amendment by allowing authorities also to dispense with the three-year prior qualification generally and in descriptions of cases. The additional discretion given by our amendments will help local authorities act strategically rather than in a piecemeal fashion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para13"></a>Amendment No. 10 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would give local authorities the option of applying different qualifying periods to different cases. As I have explained, the purpose of introducing discretion for local authorities to dispense with the three-year qualifying period is to help achieve strategic aims such as dealing with empty properties. To introduce the discretion to vary the qualifying period would create uncertainty among applicants and the possibility of the discretion being used to control expenditure on grants rather than achieve strategic goals. I am sure that is something which the noble Baroness would be anxious to avoid.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para14"></a>In view of what I have said, I hope that the House will agree to my amendments, and that the proposers of the other two will feel happy not to move them. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-10_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has in part answered my amendment, which was designed to seek clarification. It does not seem to me to be logical to provide for a qualifying period of three years, or no qualifying period at all, but not to allow a local strategy which may require a short qualifying period, perhaps to establish the bona fides of the applicant. I can see that there might be occasions where a local authority would regard it, in a particular case or in general cases, inappropriate to require a short qualifying period.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para15"></a>I support the amendment. I was one of those who criticised the provision on Second Reading as well as in Committee. It is entirely right that the qualifying period should not have to be applied, so that empty properties can be brought back into use with greater ease and that first-time buyers, who may be the likely buyers of such properties, will be able to apply for grants. Nevertheless, it seems a little odd to say that the qualifying period will apply at one end of the spectrum or at the other, but nowhere in between. That is why I tabled my amendment to the Minister's amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for presenting these amendments and reacting to the debates we had in Committee. It is worth paying tribute to the Government for the distance that they have moved and for recognising the common sense arguments which were put forward in Committee by various noble Lords across the Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para16"></a>I hope that the Minister will not think me churlish if I ask the Government to go just that little bit further. With these amendments the Government are effectively saying, "Yes, the qualifying period is there, but local authorities have a discretion to dispense with it if they <P>


<a name="column_818"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 818</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>see fit". The Minister mentioned the criterion of empty properties. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, mentioned first-time buyers. I should define that more closely. We need to recognise the importance of newly married couples as people who need the home improvement grants that they can obtain from local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para17"></a>We are going to give local authorities discretion in terms of how they disperse whatever resources they feel necessary for home improvement grants. We must ask how they will exercise that discretion. What sort of criteria are they likely to use in determining who receives the grants and who does not?
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para18"></a>My concern is that by providing in the Bill the concept of a qualifying period we are nudging local authorities in a particular direction by saying, "This is a useful criterion to use when you are making your discretionary assessment". I hope that we can be a little more relaxed about the way in which we consider local authorities will exert their discretion and will not give them such a pointer. I believe that even the Government recognise that that may not be a good way of exercising discretion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para19"></a>I hope that we can encourage local authorities to think of discretion in terms of the greatest need, the best impact that limited finances will have in a particular local environment and the way in which local authority resources may lever more private-sector resources into that endeavour. I hope that we can encourage local authorities to come forward with novel and beneficial ways of supporting their communities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-10_para20"></a>I hope that the Government do not think me churlish in asking whether before Third Reading they can go a little further and dispense with the suggestion that there should be a qualifying period. I hope that they can be expansive with local authorities and trust them to come up with the best criterion for discretion within their areas.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60418-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the anxieties about the excessive rigidity of having a three-year qualifying period. That is good and I am pleased that the Minister has tabled the amendment. However, I am puzzled about one matter. Having given local authorities the power to dispense with the necessity to comply with a particular condition, Clause 10(2) remains. It provides that the qualifying period is three years, and although that can now be dispensed with it continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or such other period as may be specified by order of the Secretary of State, ending with the date of the application". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I believe that that is an unnecessary provision because, when the local authority can dispense with the period altogether, I can see no circumstances in which the Secretary of State would wish to have a period different from the three-year period. That provision may require tidying up but, in principle, I am happy with the Minister's comments about his amendment which meets the objectives of Amendment No. 11.
<P>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>wish me to go. The three-year rule is part of the principle of the Bill; to establish residence and to avoid people who buy a house cheaply because it is in need of repair and then obtain money from the Government to make it more valuable. People buy a house at a price and on terms which reflect its condition. Some time is required before it is reasonable for the Government to step in and help with repairs. However, we all agree that additional flexibility is right. We prefer to keep it more simple than the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, but I am not saying that either way is perfection. We have our preferred way and I am sure that in the circumstances the noble Baroness will be happy to let us have our way.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-11_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of the amendment is to permit grants for the conversion of properties to be used to extend them. When debating the matter in Committee, the Minister said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to enable a proper big extension to be grant-aided by this method would be wrong because the purpose of the grants is to renovate buildings which are in a bad state of repair ... Larger extensions would, on the whole, fall outside the proper purpose of renovation grants which are primarily to secure the repair of existing buildings and not to subsidise the provision of new ones".--[Official Report, 26/3/96; col. 1612.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-11_para13"></a>There may well be circumstances when it makes for the best use of a building to be able to extend it rather than simply to convert it into flats or whatever. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that grants will be available which will optimise the use of buildings by ensuring that where it is appropriate to extend them so that they can be more effectively subdivided, grants will be available for that purpose. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, this amendment would enable renovation grant to be given for extensions as well as for conversions. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, spoke most persuasively to a similar amendment tabled in his name during Committee. I replied that the purpose of a renovation grant was the improvement of a dwelling and it seemed to me that while this might cover smaller extensions to dwellings, larger extensions would, on the whole, fall outside the proper purpose of renovation grants.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-11_para14"></a>I subsequently gave further thought to the question of conversions and extensions, and I wrote to the noble Lord on this important matter. I accept that there is some strength in the argument that grant should be available for internal re-arrangement where two or more properties are to be made into one larger property in order to meet the needs of a larger or extended family. Subsection (2) of Clause 12 as drafted enables grant to be given for this purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-11_para15"></a>However, as the noble Lord, Lord Williams, said during Committee, government guidance suggests that a grant for conversion should not be given where it would result in a reduction in the number of dwellings. This advice stems from an earlier wish not to reduce the supply of affordable housing.

<A NAME="60418-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, will he explain to the House the limits on the use of the word "extend"? My understanding is that planning law was revised a few years ago. That enabled extensions to buildings, houses, to be constructed without planning permission up to a certain size. In that sense, that was a variation on what had applied before when, effectively, anything which was an extension to a house required planning permission.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-11_para18"></a>It may be that there is a difference in interpretation between the Minister and the Opposition, if I may put it in that way, in terms of what they mean by "extension". It may be that the legal situation now, which will obviously be familiar to the Minister's advisers, enables an extension to be incorporated within this grant-giving power and that the old definition under the previous planning laws is no longer extant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-11_para19"></a>I am not sure whether I am making myself clear and whether the Minister understands what I am trying to say. But if the change in planning law which I believe occurred a few years ago allows the building of extensions without planning permission, that would satisfy a number of the concerns which a number of noble Lords on this side of the House have in relation to the wording of the Bill before us.

("( ) A local housing authority must approve any application for a renovation grant in respect of the following--
<BR>
(a) unfit properties occupied by a person with a disability,

(b) unfit properties occupied by a person who is receiving services or grants for services from the local welfare authority as part of a care package under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is designed to ensure that renovation grants remain mandatory for certain vulnerable groups in particular need of good housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para1"></a>The system which exists at present for mandatory renovation grants of unfit housing was considered first in 1985. Since then, public expenditure on housing renewal grants has fallen dramatically. The overall level of resources invested in grants in England has fallen from &#163;1.5 billion in 1983-84 to under &#163;0.4 billion in 1994-95. In 1994, only 40,000 renovation grants were provided compared with 214,000 improvement, repair and intermediary grants when the grant system was at its peak in 1984.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para2"></a>That would be understandable if housing conditions were improving in a similarly dramatic fashion. However, that is not the case. Figures for the English House Conditions Survey show that the number of unfit dwellings fell hardly noticeably from 1.6 million to 1.5 million between 1986 and 1991. One in six homes--that is about 3.5 million--require urgent repairs costing over &#163;1,000. That means that there are probably well over 2 million people in this country who are living in housing which is in a state of poor repair or lacks such basic amenities that it is classed as being unfit for human beings to live in.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para3"></a>Surely people should not be living in unfit housing in a modern, civilised society. The mandatory renovation grant, which was introduced in 1989, was a recognition of that unacceptable situation and an attempt to provide government funding targeted on those on the lowest incomes to address the situation. The proposals in this Bill abolish mandatory renovation grants and signal the end of that attempt to set a minimum standard and to provide help to low income groups in meeting that standard. That is a change of policy which will affect not only older and disabled people but also others on low incomes in poor housing. However, the proposals are likely to have a disproportionately harmful effect on disabled people and those requiring community care services.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para4"></a>The amendment seeks to ensure that the most vulnerable groups who are likely to be most harmed by living in unfit housing retain the protection of a mandatory grant. The amendment will mean that anyone who is disabled under the terms of the Bill or who is receiving care services as part of a community care package will be entitled to a mandatory grant if he or she is living in unfit housing and is on a sufficiently low income to be eligible for grant aid under the means test.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para5"></a>It seems to me vital that there should be special provision for those people for a number of reasons. First, such people may be less able to carry out every-day maintenance, unlike a fit young couple who may be able to carry out do-it-yourself works to maintain their homes. The homes of those who are disabled or in receipt of care services, the vast majority <P>


<a name="column_823"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 823</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of whom will probably be elderly people, are more likely to fall into disrepair as they are unable to carry out every-day maintenance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para6"></a>Older people may occupy unmodernised older housing in many places, having lived there for most of their lives. In later life they may find it difficult to undertake or finance works to bring their homes up to acceptable levels of fitness. Disabled people, a large number of whom are elderly, and those in receipt of care services are also likely to be on lower incomes than the majority of the population as they may be less able to secure well-paid employment and so are reliant on state benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para7"></a>I spoke on this subject in Committee and my noble friend has been kind enough to write to me since that time. I have removed from the amendment the fact that it dealt with elderly people and I have concentrated basically on disabled people. I hope that it will now find favour with the Government. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I should very much like to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. I know that we discussed a related amendment earlier this afternoon. But perhaps I may give an example of why I believe that this amendment is particularly important.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para8"></a>Some years ago I was canvassing in a local election campaign and I was invited into a basement flat by an elderly woman who said that she wanted to discuss a particular problem and wondered whether I could be helpful. It was a winter's evening so the flat was dark. There were two elderly women living there. They said that they would like to offer me a cup of tea but they had no light in the kitchen. I asked why that was so and they told me that the lighting was defective and they did not know how to put it in order. In this case it so happened that by climbing on to a table and dealing with the electrics for three or four minutes I was able to get the light working in the kitchen. Not many canvassers are fortunate enough to be able to make instant repairs while canvassing for political support. But the point was that those elderly women were willing to devise a way of coping throughout the whole of the winter without having any light in the kitchen. I asked how they managed and they said that they cooked in daylight and ate the food cold in the evenings because they could not find their way round the kitchen in the dark.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para9"></a>Clearly, this amendment deals with far more substantial improvements to make a building fit than the example that I have given. But there are elderly disabled people--and those two ladies were elderly and had disabilities--who may be unwilling to go through the process of having to apply for a discretionary grant. It would give them a sense of self-respect if they felt that, where they had good reason for improving an unfit property, they could do so because the local authority would provide grants on a mandatory basis. The noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, has an important point and one which I hope that the Government will accept.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, I should like to support the amendment moved so powerfully by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. I do not think that any of us in any part <P>


<a name="column_824"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 824</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the House would argue with the concept that it is quite wrong that disabled people should have to continue to live in unfit homes. They should, therefore, have a priority in such matters. Even though we have covered this ground before, I believe that this issue needs to be looked at most closely, at least on human grounds if on no others.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I should like to express my support for the amendment. However, when I first read it, I wrote on my paperwork that it was "a bit strong". The reason I say that is that it says that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A local housing authority must approve any application". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is pretty strong language. It would mean that a local authority "must" provide the grant for disabled people living in unfit properties.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para10"></a>As I said, the language is strong but it is only right, in the last decade of the 20th century in Great Britain, that we should be prepared to take strong action to deal with the problem that presents itself of disabled people living in unfit properties. The Government may possibly say, "Well, this could result in vast committed expenditure for improvements to unfit properties". There are, however, two responses to that approach.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para11"></a>First, it is a pretty shocking state of affairs if adherence to the new clause would effectively require vast commitments of public money. One might ask how the dwellings got into such a state in the first place. Secondly, we must recognise that over time the risk of a precipitate, large increase in public expenditure would probably be alleviated. It is to be hoped that in time the commitments and requirements of local authorities under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 to monitor the needs of members of their community in terms of the assistance that they require and the proper discretionary provision under the Bill would ensure that there is no desperate need in future years. Even though the strong language used by the amendment would probably lead to a precipitate increase in public expenditure, I hope that the Government will accept that that increase is totally justified if it prevents disabled people living in unfit housing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said, the amendment is in some ways a pair to Amendment No. 5. The latter amendment sought to make it mandatory for grants to be given for disabled facilities in an unfit dwelling, whereas this amendment looks at it the other way around and seeks mandatory grants to make the dwelling fit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para12"></a>The amendment seeks to remove the local housing authority's discretion in approving an application for renovation grant by making grant mandatory where an unfit dwelling is occupied by someone who is disabled or who is receiving assistance as part of a care package under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para13"></a>We share the concern of my noble friend Lord Swinfen that help should be made available to those very vulnerable people. That is why we propose to retain mandatory disabled facilities grant in a system which would otherwise be wholly discretionary. We are also <P>


<a name="column_825"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 825</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposing to replace minor works assistance, which has been such a useful tool in helping to implement community care packages, with a new grant--home repair assistance--which gives wider scope and availability to just those categories of applicant which concern my noble friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para14"></a>In drawing up the proposals, we gave much thought to whether the link under the 1989 Act between the fitness standards and disabled facilities grants should be retained. We understand that in some cases applicants in need of adaptations to their homes are deterred from applying for grant by the upheaval and disturbance likely to be caused by major renovation works. We therefore concluded that it would be better to leave it to the discretion of the local authority in each case to decide to what extent the works are essential to the health and safety of the applicant, or whether a more minor patch-and-mend grant would be sufficient to deal with the necessary repairs with the minimum of disturbance to the applicant. I can assure my noble friend that, as I said on the subject of Amendment No. 5, we shall be issuing guidance to local authorities as to how they should use that discretion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-12_para15"></a> I was also delighted to learn that people receiving canvassers from this House should have such happy expectations as regards their lighting. Not only the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, but also the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, are quick to repair lights when canvassing. However, if I was canvassing, the old ladies concerned would also have the pleasure of calling the ambulance afterwards. With those reassurances, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

I am somewhat encouraged by what my noble friend said in his response to the amendment. I shall read what he said most carefully and give it all due consideration. I hope that I shall not feel the need to return to the matter at a later stage, but I must reserve the right to do so. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 8, line 21, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) Notwithstanding subsection (5)(a) above, where the applicant requests in writing that only part of the premises be made fit for human habitation, the authority may approve such an application.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-13_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is of course the case that normally when a renovation grant is made available the whole of the property to which it applies should be improved. However, there may be instances where it is sensible to say that it is necessary to renovate or improve only part of the property. That applies when a house or flat is occupied by an elderly person who uses only part of the property and does not want the <P>


<a name="column_826"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 826</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disturbance of having the whole dwelling invaded by builders over a long period. It is possible that some elderly people would prefer not to have the whole property renovated rather than face the disruption, if it is not possible for them to have improved just the parts that they occupy.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-13_para2"></a>I do not think that that would apply in many instances; indeed, I believe that it would be unusual. However, we all know that there are some circumstances where only part of a house is occupied by an elderly person. Surely it is his or her right to go on living there as long as possible. That may involve improving some of the dwelling without improving the whole building. I believe that the amendment is sensible. I know that a similar point was discussed in Committee but, because of the way in which the discussion took place, I do not believe that we focused as much on this point as we did on some other aspects covered in the group of amendments. As I said, it is a sensible move and one which would apply in a minority of cases. However, in those cases to which it would apply, the provision would make quite a difference to the circumstances of an elderly person living alone in a house or flat. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord said, we touched on this matter in Committee. I am happy to revisit it because it is one upon which we look with some favour. However, we do not wish to take action on the amendment as it stands. The amendment raises the important question of application of the fitness standard to part of a property. As my noble friend Lord Ferrers explained in Committee, the major revision of the standard under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 introduced a more objective approach whereby fitness is determined by reference to each individual requirement in the standard and not a combination as previously. The fact that the decision as to fitness is now based on a property having to meet each individual requirement means that the standard can only sensibly be applied to a complete unit of accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-13_para3"></a>However, the Government are not unsympathetic to the thought that, with the introduction of a new renovation grant system, it would be sensible to look again at the fitness standard requirements and the way that the standard is applied.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-13_para4"></a>My noble friend Lord Ferrers gave an assurance in Committee that once the Bill is out of the way, and before the end of this year, the Government would set in train a review of the fitness standard and as part of that seek views from bodies such as the local authority associations and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health. At that time my noble friend expressed the hope that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, would see the wisdom of looking at the issues raised by his amendment and the others he raised in Committee relating to fitness for human habitation as part of a proper review. The important point here is that much hangs on the fitness standard and changes to the requirements and the way the standard is applied should not be contemplated without the fullest consideration and consultation. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, will <P>


<a name="column_827"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 827</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>remember that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, warmly welcomed this approach. I hope this is still the case and that he will therefore feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the sympathetic attitude the Minister shows to what this amendment seeks to achieve. I understand what he says--and what was said at Committee stage--namely, that there will be a wide review. It is a pity that, having a major Bill on the subject, we cannot deal with it in the Bill and have to leave it until later. However, given that the Minister has conceded that there is a case for thinking about a measure of this kind, and that the Government will deal with it in the way he described, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-13_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 16 I wish to speak also to Amendment No. 17. We have given some thought to the views expressed during the Committee consideration of this Bill about the likely need for a prior qualifying period for some types of grants. In Committee we confirmed that it was not envisaged that general powers as in Clause 17 applying to landlords' applications for common parts grants would be used in the foreseeable future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-13_para8"></a>Following our discussion in Committee we have considered fully the points made by noble Lords, particularly on the equivalent provision for grants for houses in multiple occupation. In the light of that discussion, we now believe that for the purposes of clarity it would be preferable to remove the clause from the Bill. Therefore, we have brought forward Amendments Nos. 27 and 29 in order to achieve this objective for HMO grants. In order to keep the provisions for grants to landlords consistent, Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 remove the provision for common parts grants. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I query the Government's view on this matter. It seems as though they hold a different view when it is a case of landlords and the grant applications they may make to the view they hold as regards householders; namely, individuals seeking home improvement grants for their homes. In the earlier discussion when we discussed the amendment which gave local authorities discretion to waive the qualifying period, we were told it was essential that the qualifying period be retained and that it be waived if the local authority saw fit. Effectively the Government were saying it was important that the qualifying period should exist as regards householders who applied for a home improvement grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-13_para9"></a>I wonder why there seem to be different criteria as regards landlords. Why is it that householders should be subject to a qualifying period--effectively that means that the householder is expected to live in poor standard <P>


<a name="column_828"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 828</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accommodation until he can obtain a grant after three years--but a landlord, who does not have to put up with the poor standards, can obtain a grant without being subject to the three-year qualifying period? There is a hint of double standards here. I hope the Government can explain to the House how they arrive at these apparently different criteria for judging landlords and householders.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, the basic difference of course is that the landlord will not live in the property and should be encouraged to improve the property for the benefit of his tenants. But in general landlords are under a much stricter grant scheme anyway and are subject to a rather different grant scheme. As we said in Committee, this power was in the Bill but we could not envisage using it in the context of all the other restrictions and powers that we had. Therefore we have thought it sensible to remove a power from the Bill that we never thought of using on the principle of not adding things to the Bill which are there unnecessarily. It is in the nature of a tidying up exercise in terms of what we intend to use the Bill for. I can understand the points that the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, makes, but I do not think they affect our resolve in this matter.

Amendment No. 8 would add to the tenants described in subsection (5) of Clause 20 as eligible to apply for disabled facilities grant tenants occupying the dwelling under "an introductory tenancy".

<A NAME = "60418-13_para15"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Swinfen for raising the question of introductory tenants in Committee. We have given the matter further thought. While we consider that, in practice, it is possible that introductory tenants would be eligible to apply for disabled facilities grant in any event, we agree that an amendment specifically to add these tenants to the descriptions of tenants eligible to apply would put the matter beyond doubt.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 19 I would also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 20, 25, 26, 53, 54, 58, 59, 88 and 108. These amendments return to the familiar issue of the definition of a "disabled person" as applied for the purposes of eligibility for disabled facilities grant which were debated during Committee. There was concern from all who spoke in Committee that the words used in the present definition to describe particular disabilities, taken from the National Assistance Act 1948, caused offence to disabled people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para3"></a>However, it was clear then from those who spoke at Committee that the coverage of the definition was not considered to be a problem. I explained in Committee that the purpose behind the wording of the existing definition was to maintain consistency with other legislation relating to the provision of services to disabled people but, in the light of the points raised by noble Lords, I promised that I would look again at the wording of the definition and return to it at Report stage. I have done that and I now explain my conclusions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para4"></a>Part I of this Bill is primarily concerned with matters relating to housing for which my department is responsible. Part I accordingly offers no opportunity to address any wider issue of defining "disabled person" for other purposes, in particular in relation to services provided by social services authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para5"></a>Nevertheless, I recognise that it is desirable to have a core definition common to legislation affecting the provision of services to disabled people. A definition linked to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, as Amendment No. 20, tabled in the name of my noble friend Lord Swinfen seeks to achieve, would be outside this common core. The 1995 Act is an anti-discrimination measure and its subject matter is therefore quite separate from that of Part I of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para6"></a>Subsection (1) of Amendment No. 108 now proposed sets out a definition, in modern language, of "disabled person" for the purposes of Part I of the Bill. Subsections (2) and (3) are deeming provisions. Subsection (2) passports into subsection (1) people aged 18 and over who are either registered or receiving services under arrangements made under the National Assistance Act 1948, or for whom, in the opinion of the social services authority, such arrangements might be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para7"></a>Subsection (3) makes analogous provision for people aged under 18 who are either registered as disabled under the Children Act 1989 or who, in the opinion of the social services authority, are disabled within the meaning of that Act. The effect is to cover, as at present, all people, whether children or adults, who are either registered or registrable as disabled.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para8"></a>Subsection (5) makes it clear that subsection (1) of the new clause is not to affect the interpretation of the definitions of "disabled person" and "disabled child" in the 1948 and 1989 Acts.

<A NAME = "60418-14_para9"></a>In bringing forward the amendment, I believe that we have addressed the concerns expressed by noble Lords in Committee. The amendment substitutes, for the current wording, modern and more acceptable language while maintaining the essential close link with other relevant legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para10"></a>I have some sympathy with the arguments put forward by noble Lords that the language used in the 1948 Act and in related statutes should be brought up to date. That is not something we can do in this Bill. Several government departments would be concerned.

<A NAME="60418-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that he was responding to the wishes of the House when there was widespread concern about the definition of a disabled person as suggested in the Bill. I am disappointed that in the end the Government have not dealt with the issue as put forward by so many noble Lords. I welcome the fact that there is some change. However, many of the difficulties discussed at Committee stage still remain as regards Amendment No. 108 as drafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para12"></a>Let me cite a few points. First, if we have the new definition, within British legislation there will still be three alternative definitions of disability: within this Bill; within the Disability Discrimination Act; and within the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act. It seems to me that the most recent definition--that in the Disability Discrimination Act--has the merit of having had a great deal of thought and the support of the main disability organisations, and represents an up-to-date, sensible and workable definition which Parliament agreed only recently.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para13"></a>Secondly, there is a strong suggestion that the disability discussed in Amendment No. 108 has to be a permanent disability. That is rather inflexible. I may misinterpret the wording, but it seems to suggest permanence. People may be disabled for a period of time, but, happily for them, the condition is not permanent. Yet they will not derive the benefits that they would if the definition were more flexible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para14"></a>For those reasons, I am sorry that the Government have not done as many Members of the this House urged. I believe that the proposed definition will still cause many difficulties when applied.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for having listened to what we said at Committee stage. I welcome the fact that my noble friend has brought forward an alternative definition. I should like to take the opportunity to thank him for writing to me with a draft of the amendments, in particular Amendment No. 108--the new clause after Clause 98. I received it late last night.

<A NAME = "60418-14_para15"></a>As a result, I shall not move my Amendment No. 20. I do not believe that I should be successful if I were to divide the House tonight in an endeavour to get the provision into the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para16"></a>Amendment No. 108 introduces the new clause with the definition. It addresses some of the concerns about the definition of a disabled person. There is some updating of the language on the face of the Bill, but it still hinges on the definition within the National Assistance Act 1948, which is outdated in its language and approach, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said, has a requirement for a disability to be permanent.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para17"></a>The new wording is cumbersome and could lead to the very situation that the Government wish to avoid--of several definitions of a disabled person within different legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para18"></a>The reason that the disability must be permanent is because there is still a requirement to be registered under the National Assistance Act 1948 or for social services to decide that welfare arrangements might be made under that Act. The 1948 Act specifically states that a person must have a "permanent and substantial disability". Although obviously disabled facilities grants should not be available for people who have a short-term injury, I believe that they must be available for people with a disability which is long-term but may not necessarily be permanent.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para19"></a>An example of that is a child with a severe arthritic condition, which can be extremely disabling. I understand that frequently such children can grow out of their arthritis and of their disability. Therefore it is important that there should not be a requirement for the disability to be permanent for a person to be eligible for consideration for a disabled facilities grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para20"></a>I wonder whether the wording of subsection (1) of Amendment No. 108 is likely in practice to cause problems. Subsection (1)(a) states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"his sight, hearing or speech is substantially impaired". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That might be interpreted as sight and hearing or speech. I am sure that that is not the intention. However I wonder whether the word "or" could be inserted between "sight" and "hearing" to ensure that there is no ambiguity.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para21"></a>A similar problem exists with subsection (1)(c) where there could be some ambiguity in practice. I suggest that the subsection might be redrafted to state that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he is substantially disabled by illness or injury or impairment since birth, or otherwise". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That would be an improvement and would ensure clarity.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para22"></a>Perhaps my noble friend could consider this point between now and a later stage in the Bill. There may not be time to deal with the issue in this House. However, another place could effect the necessary amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para23"></a>I still believe that all those problems could be overcome as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said, if we were to use the definition in the Disability Discrimination Act. However, despite what I have said, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>I am grateful that my noble friend has listened to what we said and, with his officials, has made an attempt to improve the situation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-14_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Darcy (de Knayth): </B>   My Lords, I had added my name to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, because I was anxious to get rid of the outmoded wording in the definition in the 1948 Act. I stress that I have not consulted widely yet on the Minister's definition; nor have I talked to the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply about the definition referring only to permanent disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para24"></a>As the Minister explained, the old definition covered everyone who should be eligible for disabled facilities grant. When I consulted, I found that in the Disability Discrimination Act the definition did not. I welcome Amendment No. 108. However, I stress that the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, has consulted more widely than I have and has gone more thoroughly into the definition. He may have found things that are not quite acceptable and right. I believe that the Minister is on the right lines. I thank him very much for having gone to this trouble. The definition under the 1948 Act continued because it covered those people whom we wanted it to cover. It was merely the language that was not right.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-14_para25"></a>This provision may need a little more tidying, but I hope that something like it will become the accepted definition in future legislation. Being a very starry-eyed optimist, I hope that perhaps it might be resurrected as a more attractive phoenix in the Disabled Persons and Carers (Short-term Breaks) Bill in the name of my noble friend Lord Rix. However, more realistically, at this point I warmly welcome the Government's amendment, but with the slight proviso that the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, has gone through it with a finer toothcomb than I have done.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60418-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I wish to ask the Minister a question. He may feel that the answer is so obvious that the question should not be asked, but experience has taught me that it is better to ask. The question is whether subsections (2) and (3) of Amendment No. 108 limit subsection (1). In other words, is a person to be taken to be disabled if, and only if, the conditions set out in subsections (2) and (3) apply? Alternatively, may a person be regarded as disabled under subsection (1)(a),(b) or (c), but without the application of subsections (2) or (3)?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, let me give immediate comfort to the noble Baroness. Subsections (2) and (3) in Amendment No. 108 passport people into subsection (1). That subsection is a defining clause; subsections (2) and (3) state that people who qualify under those also qualify under subsection (1) and no arguments will be admitted against that. It also covers the question raised by my noble friend Lord Swinfen and the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, as to the reference to permanence. That characteristic occurs in the National Assistance Act 1948 but it is not a characteristic of subsection (1). Therefore, as concerns the new clause, there is no requirement for permanence. "Substantial" suggests a reasonably long-term disability, but there is no requirement in it for permanence.

<A NAME = "60418-15_para0"></a>A definition evolved in the course of two weeks' hard work by my officials is not necessarily perfect, but I am sure that the House will agree that it has been put together with a great deal of goodwill and it is entirely pointed in the right direction. We shall look with care at all that has been said today and will listen to anyone else who may have opinions as to improvements which could be made to the definition.
<P>

<BR>
("( ) making the dwelling or building safe for the disabled occupant and other persons residing with him;").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 21 and to speak to Amendment No. 23. During the Committee's consideration of the Bill we listened with interest to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and I am sad that he is not in his place today. He spoke eloquently about the needs of those with severe behavioural problems and in particular about the provision of a safe room for a person with such disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para6"></a>While I would hope that local authorities have given mandatory grant in the past for such purposes, Amendment No. 21 seeks to clarify the position as we feel the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has raised an important issue. The amendment provides for mandatory disabled facilities grant to be given to render the dwelling or building safe for use by a disabled occupant and other persons who reside with him.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para7"></a>The provision is intended to be sufficiently flexible to give grant to provide a special safe room or rooms for a disabled person who suffers from behavioural difficulties and for those who live with him, and also to provide safety measures for disabled people generally where these are necessary. The specific facilities will depend on all the circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para8"></a>Amendment No. 23 in the name of my noble friend Lord Swinfen would provide for mandatory disabled facilities grant to be given to improve or install a lighting system suitable for a visually impaired occupant. During Committee my noble friend spoke with admirable clarity to a very similar amendment tabled in his name. I said then that we believed that improved lighting systems should come under the discretionary rather than the mandatory heading.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para9"></a>I fully appreciate my noble friend's concern to ensure that those who are partially sighted and who require an enhanced form of lighting to enable them to carry out better the everyday tasks and activities many of us take for granted should have grant available for this purpose as of right.
<P>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 834</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para10"></a>As my noble friend made clear to the Committee, the provision of enhanced lighting is an important matter and I stress that local authorities will be able to give discretionary grant for this purpose. It is also the case that Amendment No. 21 would enable the provision of lighting to be a mandatory purpose where safety is an issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para11"></a>It might also help my noble friend if I add that, were it to become clear that some visually impaired people were not being given access to grant to enable them to benefit from enhanced lighting, the Secretary of State could, if he considered it appropriate in the circumstances, use the power in subsection (1)(i) of Clause 24 to add to the list of mandatory purposes by means of an order.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para12"></a>However, the thrust of the new grant regime we are proposing is to give local authorities maximum flexibility to determine how they can best use their available resources. We remain of the view that the decision as to whether grant should be awarded in such cases is one which should be left to local authorities' judgment based on the circumstances of each case. I am not convinced that this is an area in which we ought to go further. I look forward to hearing what my noble friend has to say on his amendment and beg to move mine.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the amendment moved by my noble friend. As a result of his Amendment No. 21, I shall not move my Amendment No. 23 because obviously for a visually disabled person a building will not be safe without proper and adequate lighting. It is not just a case of taking out the 100-watt bulb and putting in a 150-watt bulb. It may be a matter of putting spotlights in the right place, or putting lights of differing colours in and ensuring that the light is on the areas where the disabled person is working or studying. I shall not speak at length because there is much to be dealt with tonight, save to say that I welcome my noble friend's amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-15_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Darcy (de Knayth): </B>   My Lords, I wish briefly to reiterate what my noble friend Lord Swinfen said and welcome Amendment No. 21, as my noble friend Lord Rix cannot be here to do so himself.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I too welcome Amendment No. 21. I note with interest what the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, said in supporting his Amendment No. 23. I note that he will not move it, but I believe that Amendment No. 23 goes rather wider than safety in terms of having lighting systems for disabled people. To that extent there is still a gap in what is to be provided. However, subject to the hope that the Government will address themselves to that gap, I welcome Amendment No. 21.
<P>

Page 15, leave out lines 3 to 5 and insert--
<BR>
("( ) In considering whether the relevant works are necessary and appropriate to meet the needs of the disabled occupant, the local housing authority shall--
<BR>
(a) co-operate with the relevant social services authority, or
<BR>
(b) seek written confirmation from a general practitioner or other suitably qualified professional where this is more appropriate.
<BR>
The authority mentioned in paragraph (a) shall co-operate in rendering such assistance as is reasonable in the circumstances.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that local authorities, when assessing the need for the disabled facilities grant and adaptations, can either co-operate with the relevant social services authority or, where more appropriate, can seek written confirmation from a general practitioner or other suitably qualified professional. The purpose is not that the local authority should consult both, but that they should choose a relevant person or authority, depending on the circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para19"></a>At the present time, in order to assess whether a disabled facilities grant is necessary and appropriate to meet the needs of a disabled occupant, a local housing authority will often require an assessment from an occupational therapist. The social services authority <P>


<a name="column_836"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 836</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would have a duty to undertake an assessment of aids and adaptations, but the waiting time for such assessments can often be extremely lengthy.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para20"></a>Often, when only minor adaptations such as rails in the bathroom are required, a disabled person's general practitioner would be quite capable of assessing whether that is necessary and appropriate. In other situations it may be that another qualified professional, such as an RNIB housing worker, would be as appropriate as an occupational therapist to make an assessment. RADAR, for example, is aware of a disabled person who had a full occupational therapy assessment for adaptations some years ago. That individual now requires an extra handrail on the stairs. The individual requested an occupational therapist's assessment for that purpose in October 1995, but has been informed that an assessment is unlikely to be possible before June 1997 at the earliest. That is a minimum waiting time of 20 months. That person will probably decide to have the handrail put in independently, but as the individual is on benefit it will be financially difficult and could well put the person into debt.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para21"></a>Waiting times for occupational therapist assessments are often up to two years, and longer waiting times have been reported. Although the Government are reviewing occupational therapy services, there is a fundamental problem. There are large numbers of disabled people requiring assessments for adaptations, and there is a shortage of occupational therapists. Many local authorities are now using occupational therapy assistants to undertake assessments. As there is a growing number of disabled, and elderly people who are becoming disabled, it appears that the problem will inevitably get worse.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para22"></a>Around 15 per cent. of disabled facility grants are for less then &#163;1,000; 7 per cent. of all such grants are for a shower over the bath; 4 per cent. are for handrails. It would be quite reasonable for a general practitioner or other suitably qualified professional to recommend those. If local authorities accept recommendations from occupational therapy assistants, then surely a recommendation from a general practitioner should be equally valid.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para23"></a>In some situations a suitably qualified professional from an organisation with specific expertise appertaining to the needs of the disabled person could be just as relevant as an occupational therapist. For example, a special housing worker from a large HIV and AIDS organisation could give expert advice on access, heating and bathing requirements of the person with HIV or AIDS.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para24"></a>This amendment would give local housing authorities the discretion to decide who was the most appropriate person to assess the need for adaptation. It would not undermine the invaluable role of occupational therapists, but would simply give some flexibility to local authorities to assess the situation and request information from the most appropriate person. Where there is an obvious need for major adaptations, an occupational therapist assessment could be required; but where there is a straightforward requirement for some simple adaptations, a general practitioner could make the recommendation.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para25"></a>Of additional benefit would be the opportunity for the local authority, alternatively, to call on the expertise of a professional with particular knowledge of disabled persons' requirements. That could all be made clear in guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-15_para26"></a>Basically, by allowing local authorities to choose the appropriate person to make the assessment depending upon the situation of the individual the whole process could be speeded up. If my noble friend the Minister does not wish to see the discretion on the face of the Bill, it would be very helpful if he could consider including in guidance information for local authorities on situations where it may be appropriate for them to request information from a general practitioner or other professional rather than waiting for an occupational therapist assessment when that may not be necessary.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I support this amendment, which the noble Lord explained in detail. It is important. At one level it describes what ought to be good practice on the part of a local housing authority. In so far as local housing authorities are sensitive to the needs of disabled people, I am sure many of them will behave in the way suggested by the amendment. However, they do not all do that. It would be proper to have on the face of the Bill an obligation on local housing authorities to consult in such instances with social services authorities or general practitioners where that is appropriate and where occupational therapy assessments are not forthcoming or not forthcoming quickly. It is a very reasonable amendment. It would help local authorities to move rapidly to good practice where they are not already doing so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Warnock: </B>   My Lords, I support this amendment very strongly. Anything that eliminates undue delay or makes the waiting time shorter is a very important and serious addition to the Bill. I very much hope that the Minister will give consideration to this proposal. Twenty months may be the entire length of life that the person in question has, and very often 20 months is the minimum for getting an occupational therapist assessment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lady Darcy (de Knayth): </B>   My Lords, I, too, support this amendment. I believe the wording is drawn directly from the guidelines for housing associations, which have this flexibility. RADAR gave an example of someone who needed handrails up to the house. As the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, explained, that can take up to two years. Because it was a simple request for a handrail, all that was needed was a letter from a GP confirming it, and it was installed the following week. Obviously, if a disabled person needs a full OT assessment, or his or her needs are complicated, the housing association will ask for an OT to do the assessment. It is very valuable to have such guidelines. They offer flexibility: you can have simple confirmation of need in such instances, which speeds things up enormously. I support it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Swinfen has again moved an amendment requiring housing <P>


<a name="column_838"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 838</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authorities to co-operate with social services in deciding the adaptation needs of the disabled occupant and also to seek written confirmation from either a GP or other qualified professional.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para0"></a>We explained in Committee why we considered his amendment unnecessary and why we believe that the collaboration which the amendment seeks to achieve already happens in practice. The process of providing help with adaptations through disabled facilities grants must, of course, be conducted with full co-operation and collaboration between the respective authorities. But I believe responsibility for advising on the particular needs of disabled applicants is a matter entirely for the social services authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para1"></a>In Committee my noble friend Lord Swinfen explained that the purpose of his amendment was to bring the duty of social services authorities to co-operate into line with Clause 164 of the Housing Bill. I agree entirely with him that it is essential that those authorities co-operate fully in the disabled facilities grant process.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para2"></a>However, social services already have statutory duties under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 to provide assistance in arranging home adaptations to secure greater safety, comfort or convenience. I understand they use these powers widely in considering with their colleagues in housing authorities what should be provided to meet the adaptation needs of disabled people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para3"></a>Since the grant system was introduced in July 1990, housing and social services authorities have built up locally efficient systems and procedures for the day-to-day operation of disabled facilities grants to ensure the effective delivery of help in meeting the adaptation needs of disabled people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para4"></a>The duty we have placed on housing authorities to consult social services authorities relates solely to consultation with that authority. I believe that is right. With respect to my noble friend Lord Swinfen I believe it is the social services authority and not the housing authority that is best placed to decide in each case who should be involved in the assessment. In most cases it is carried out by the occupational therapist, who may be employed by social services or the health service.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para5"></a>However, social services may decide that others need to be involved in the process, depending on the person's circumstances. This may involve discussion with a GP who has specialist knowledge of the applicant, voluntary groups of carers who have day-to-day contact with the disabled occupant and are therefore well placed to provide views on what adaptations are needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para6"></a>As I have said, my noble friend's amendment would place the burden of taking these decisions on the housing authority when such matters should clearly be left to social services authorities in carrying out their statutory duty to provide advice to housing authorities on these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para7"></a>Both my noble friend Lord Swinfen and the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth), drew attention to the current shortage of occupational therapists which has caused delays in obtaining assessments. The noble Baroness said that, for relatively small items, a general practitioner would be perfectly capable of carrying out <P>


<a name="column_839"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 839</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the assessment without the need to wait for an occupational therapist. My noble friend Lord Swinfen echoed that argument at this stage of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para8"></a>I fully understand that concern but hope that noble Lords will be reassured to hear that there is nothing to prevent such an arrangement being applied under the present arrangements, if the social services authority considers that to be the appropriate course of action. Authorities, therefore, are already able to decide for themselves who should be involved in particular cases, and I am not sure that the amendment of my noble friend Lord Swinfen would enable authorities to do anything that they cannot or do not already do.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para9"></a>The last part of my noble friend's speech suggested that the equivalent of this amendment might be included in guidance. As I indicated, that is not a matter for my department. I shall certainly raise the matter with my noble friend Lady Cumberlege and between us we shall write a letter to him.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para10"></a>In Committee, my noble friend said that the intention of his amendment to require social services authorities to co-operate in rendering reasonable assistance was because of his concern that the consultation with that authority takes place rather late in the application process. However, our research shows that in most cases an application to the housing authority for a disabled facilities grant arises because of a referral from the social services authority rather than the other way around. In such cases, it is likely that the occupational therapist's assessment has already been carried out prior to referral for a disabled facilities grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-16_para11"></a>After that rather long explanation, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

We have given some thought to the views expressed during the Committee consideration of this Bill about the likely need for Clause 28.

As we pointed out, the power was unlikely to be used and in responding at Committee the noble Lord affirmed that the Government had no intention of using the power. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to accept the noble Lord's amendment. It is also reasonable that local authorities should be left with discretion to decide their own strategies.

<a name="column_841"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 841</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of amendments with the intention of clarifying the clause. That gave us the opportunity to consider further the need to retain Clause 31.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para7"></a>We believe that the maintenance of a property in the private rented sector is the responsibility of the owner. That led to our initial decision in the White Paper to restrict landlords' access to grants. With the move in this Bill to a discretionary grant system accessible by all landlords we were keen that the message of owners' responsibility to maintain their property was not lost.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para8"></a>Clause 31 was included in case experience showed that, rather than maintain properties to a good standard, landlords waited for a local authority to take enforcement action or offer grant assistance. Were this pattern of activity to emerge, we would have wished to take steps to restrict grant availability.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para9"></a>However, the comments that we have received from local authorities about how they expect to use the power to give discretionary grant assistance to landlords has reassured us that the power will be used for strategic purposes and that we are unlikely ever to need the power in Clause 31 to restrict grant availability. Bearing in mind the concerns expressed in Committee, we have concluded that the clause should be removed. I beg to move.

<A NAME = "60418-17_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is tabled in my name coupled with that of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. In Committee we had quite an involved discussion about means testing. The purpose of the amendment, which was said of the amendment that we moved in Committee, is to ensure that the means test calculation takes into account mortgage interest payments and payments on other sums on which relief is in fact given under the income tax Acts. We are trying to match up the provision with the income tax Acts.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para13"></a>Anyone who has a mortgage will realise that it is an important outgoing from the household. In Committee the Government argued:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Our view is that the amount of mortgage an individual takes out, or the amount he pays towards life insurance or other premiums for which he can reclaim tax paid, is a matter of personal choice, and as such we see no case for those amounts to feature in the renovation grant means test"--[Official Report, 26/3/96; col. 1651.]  </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The Government went on to say that the inclusion of such amounts would encourage individuals to take up larger mortgages. However, they slid a little during the argument in Committee in giving an undertaking to reply in detail at a later stage when they realised that the wording of the amendment took up wording in the education grants means test. The purpose of tabling the amendment at Report stage is, first, to give the Minister an opportunity to clarify, if that is possible, the response given in Committee and, secondly, to answer those points made by the Government in debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para14"></a>Our view is that mortgage interest payments are an important household outgoing and, when we come to renovation grants, it is important that those things should be taken into account. I can elaborate on the effect of disregarding such mortgage interest payments if the noble Lord wishes me to; I have a great deal of material which will allow me to demonstrate the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para15"></a>In our view it is unlikely that the changes we are suggesting to the grant means test will alter the operation of the housing market in any meaningful sense. A decision to purchase a house is usually taken without taking into account changes to personal income and changes to the housing market, which, as we all know, are impossible to predict.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para16"></a>The assumption on which we should work is that most people purchasing a house will have taken into account its maintenance needs. It is not true to say--the second argument advanced by the Government--that the allowances included in the means test are an adequate provision for housing costs. As the allowances are, by their nature, applied uniformly to all applicants, they will not take into account differences in the housing costs of individuals and the anomaly will remain.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para17"></a>The amendment is intended to probe the Government's view on the matter. It is something that has not been fully considered by the Government. We believe that there is virtue in making sure that any means test for renovation grants takes into account the essential outgoings of those who are owners of property, <P>


<a name="column_843"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 843</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and that includes mortgage interest payments and other consequential outgoings such as insurance. In that probing spirit, I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, in supporting my noble friend's amendment, the most powerful argument is that it would give a common base with the other grants that he mentioned such as the education grant. To have two different measures of income for disbursement of public money in terms of grants will appear illogical and nonsensical to the ordinary householder. Therefore, from the point of view of what may be described as public regard for the law and the criteria on which public bodies make their judgments, it would be sensible to adopt the same criteria when it comes to assessment of income for grants.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Williams, has again moved an amendment requiring an applicant's mortgage interest, life insurance premiums and other tax deductible payments to be disregarded in the means test regulations under this clause. All means tests have their imperfections and different forms. Perhaps I may help the House by explaining the principles behind the present means test for renovation grants and explaining why the amendment would discriminate against certain applicants.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para18"></a>The purpose of the present means test is to ensure that help given towards the cost of essential repairs and adaptations goes to those in greatest need, whether they own their own home, have a mortgage or are renting. The test follows housing benefit rules and seeks to assess household needs in the same way as for those claiming help through the social security system. It is a framework for determining what an applicant can reasonably afford to contribute, if anything, to the cost of works. It establishes how much money a household needs to meet reasonable weekly expenditure, including reasonable housing costs. It does that by a system of awarding personal allowances and premiums which take account of the specific circumstances of the family.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para19"></a>We recognise that there are demands on a person's income, including mortgage payments and rents. The test therefore provides for an additional premium of &#163;40 per week over and above housing benefit levels to ensure that allowance has been made in the test for housing costs such as mortgages and rent. The system treats all those seeking grants fairly and equally, or at least as fairly and equally as a means test is likely to do. Because it makes allowance for reasonable housing costs to be taken into account, it does not penalise those without mortgages or those who pay similar amounts in rent, as I believe the noble Lord's amendment would do.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para20"></a>I share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, in tabling the amendment that we should provide all the help we can within available resources so that people can remain in homes in a good state of repair. However, his amendment does not treat all housing costs equally and those people, particularly the elderly, who may have no mortgage or who have either paid it off or are close to doing so and therefore have small amounts of interest to pay would be unfairly treated. Furthermore, those <P>


<a name="column_844"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 844</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>living in private rented accommodation paying equivalent amounts of rent would also be disadvantaged under his proposals. In my view, it would also risk resources going to those who can afford to take out higher mortgages at the expense of those who perhaps cannot borrow so much but who are nevertheless equally deserving of grant aid. Some people, especially younger applicants, may be encouraged to borrow more to move up market in the knowledge that they will receive more grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para21"></a>The amendment would also require certain tax deductible payments of widows' and children's annuities and personal pensions to be disregarded. We see no case for disregarding those payments which are purely a matter of personal choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-17_para22"></a>We share the anxiety of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, that people seeking grant to adapt or improve their property are given the fairest treatment in determining their ability to contribute to the cost of works. We believe that the means test that we have chosen is the best practical way of doing that. I would like to think that I might have persuaded the noble Lord of our argument, but I take leave to doubt that.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, as always, I am grateful to the noble Lord for speaking to his brief. I do not accept the arguments. I cannot see, to take mortgage interest payments as an example, why a private owner who is burdened with a mortgage for one reason or another--individual choice which may have taken place a long time ago--should be disadvantaged compared with another private householder who is paying rent. Rent is a straightforward monthly outgoing; mortgage payments are a straightforward monthly outgoing, unless one is in a mortgage system which does not require monthly payments. Nevertheless, it is a cost of owning the house. When we are talking of renovation of a dwelling, the two things seem to be compatible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para0"></a>I do not understand, when assessing the means test, why the Government insist on saying that rent may be taken into account as outgoings. The noble Lord wants to intervene.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, it may be helpful if I say that no individual personal housing costs are taken into account. An allowance of &#163;40 per week is made, whatever the housing situation of the applicant. Neither the rent nor the mortgage interest is considered.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, that makes the position slightly worse, because in that case it is not a proper means test; it is a benefits assessment which across the board does not reflect the reality of life.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para1"></a>However, I am sure that we shall not get any further with this discussion. I said that this is a probing amendment. I am quite certain that the matter will be taken up at a later stage in another place. It is vital that people who are on the margin of contributing to the renovation of their houses and on the margin of receiving grant should be treated fairly. I do not believe that the Bill as presently constructed treats people equally, one with another. Nevertheless, I accept that the noble Lord has done his best to persuade me otherwise. <P>


<a name="column_845"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 845</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>But I am unpersuaded. The matter will certainly be taken up in another place. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 19, line 46, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) In the case of an application for a disabled facilities grant regulations must, in particular--
<BR>
(a) make provision for account to be taken only of the income and assets of the disabled occupant himself and his parents if he is living with them and under 18;
<BR>
(b) make provision for account to be taken of the needs of the disabled occupant himself and any person who is dependent on him.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is designed to ensure that local authorities take into account only the income of the disabled occupant, and his parents if he is under 18 and living with them, when considering a disabled facilities grant, and further to ensure that local authorities take into account the needs of the disabled occupant and any person who is dependent on him.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para4"></a>Disabled facilities grants are vital for providing adaptations for disabled people to help them to continue to live in their own home. The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys estimated in 1985 that one in five of the population has some form of disability. Four million people in this country experience mobility difficulties. It is not surprising, therefore, that in 1993 more than &#163;70 million was spent through local authorities on the provision of disabled facilities grants.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para5"></a>Currently, I understand that the average value of the disabled facilities grant awarded is some &#163;3,700. The grants are means tested and 17 per cent. of all those awarded grants make a contribution to the cost of the works. The proposals within the Bill for the scope of the regulations concerning the means test would allow the income of not only the disabled occupant to be taken into account but also the income of other non-disabled people living in the household. Adaptations carried out on the home of the disabled occupant are for the benefit of that disabled person and not for other members of their household. The legislation states that the relevant works should be necessary and appropriate to meet the needs of the disabled occupant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para6"></a>Research undertaken in 1995 by PIEDA for the Department of the Environment found that 48 per cent. of disabled facilities grants entailed improving mobility in the dwelling through the provision, for example, of stairlifts, ramps, grabs and handrails. Those are obviously solely for the benefit of the disabled person and of no benefit to other occupants of the dwelling. Therefore, why should the income of the non-disabled people within the household be taken into account for the means test?
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para7"></a>In many cases the fact that the income of non-disabled people is taken into account in the current means test has the effect that the contribution required to the cost of the works is very difficult for the disabled person to find. A comprehensive research project undertaken by the Suffolk Coastal and Mid-Suffolk <P>


<a name="column_846"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 846</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Disability Housing Research Group found that the means-tested grants system was leaving people in financial difficulty. It stated that there are cases where help has been sought with no result because of the means test for the disabled facilities grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para8"></a>The current proposals for the scope of regulations covering the means test could lead to the income of anyone living in the household being taken into account. That could include lodgers, friends, carers or care assistants, relatives, the parents of disabled adults or even children who have an income. The original consultation document issued in July last year by the Department of the Environment entitled The Future of Private Housing Renewal Programmes in England suggested a change to the means test. For disabled facilities grants it stated that only the means of the disabled adult, and their parents in the case of those under 18, and the means of spouses and partners would be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para9"></a>During the Committee stage of the Bill the Government made mention of the relaxation of the means test proposed in the consultation and expressed sympathy with the intention of limiting the means test. My noble friend Lord Lucas further stated that he would give consideration to the detailed operation of the means test when the Government came to prepare the regulations later in the year. However, if the Government intend to limit the means test to the income of disabled occupants and their spouses, why is the scope of the regulations outlined in the Bill so wide? Surely it would be better to state the actual regulations the Government intend to use in the Bill rather than an all-encompassing list, the majority of which apparently will not be used in the regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para10"></a>There is serious concern that if this all-encompassing list remains in the Bill it will be possible at any time in the future, without further reference to Parliament, to alter the scope of the means test to bring in the income of a wide range of people. In a year or so the regulations could be altered to include the income of other people such as lodgers or relatives. Surely, if the Government are committed to including only the income of the disabled occupant and spouse, they should limit the regulations rather than allowing this almost open-ended list to appear in the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Darcy (de Knayth): </B>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. He has said it all and I just hope that the Minister will agree with the noble Lord's irrefutable logic.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I find that a very difficult act to follow. In Amendment No. 32 my noble friend has returned to the operation of the means test and how it will be applied to a disabled person seeking grant aid. I had hoped that I had been able to satisfy my noble friend's concerns when these matters were raised in Committee. Perhaps I may give my noble friend further reassurance that the concerns he has raised are without foundation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para11"></a>We have given an undertaking, which I repeated in Committee, that it was our intention that regulations be made setting out the operation of the means test for <P>


<a name="column_847"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 847</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disabled facilities grants. We feel that that is the appropriate mechanism for the level of detail required. I can confirm that for applications for mandatory disabled facilities grant only the means of the disabled person and his spouse or partner will be considered. Where the applicant is below the age of 18 the income of the parents will also be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para12"></a>My noble friend asked why the scope in the Bill is so wide. It is because discretionary grants will be means tested in a different manner than presently is the case. That is why we feel we need the wider scope.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para13"></a>The relaxation from the current practice has been widely welcomed and we believe it is preferable to the current arrangements. However, where the grant is discretionary, and therefore likely to be less vital, we believe that there is a case for reflecting that by including the means of the applicant and those of the owner, where that is a different person, in the means test calculation. Where discretionary grant is given for mandatory purposes such as to top up a grant in excess of &#163;20,000, the test as used for mandatory grant will apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para14"></a>As regards the second part of the amendment, I do not believe that we should restrict the regulations as suggested to take specific account of the needs of the disabled occupants and any dependent person to any greater extent than is already the case. We already achieve that through set allowances and premiums for applicants for disabled facilities grants.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para15"></a>In calculating an applicant's entitlement to grant, whether a renovation grant or a disabled facilities grant, all applicants must complete a means test. The test is based on an assessment of an applicant's basic needs and his income. The basic premise of the test is to see how much of an applicant's income, if any, over and above the assessed need of the household is available to finance a loan to pay for the works. Grant represents the difference between the "affordable loan" and the cost of the works. Where the financial resources of the applicant are less than the assessed need of the household, grant is available towards the full cost of works.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para16"></a>In assessing the basic needs of the household, a number of personal allowances and premiums are awarded depending on family circumstances. Therefore, if you are a couple where at least one member is aged over 18, you are assumed to need &#163;73 per week of your income before any is available to meet loan repayments. If both members of a couple are aged over 60, they are allowed a further &#163;28 per week.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para17"></a>In addition to this, for a disabled person, further allowances are built into the calculation. A couple under 60 years of age would be eligible for disability premium--&#163;28.30 per week, rising to &#163;70.10 per week where there is severe disability. Further premiums may be added in respect of disabled children and of carers, and for those disabled with at least one child aged under 19.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para18"></a>I must restate that these premiums are weekly amounts which are awarded to the personal allowances of those receiving attendance allowance, disability living allowance, disability working allowance, mobility supplement, invalidity pensions and severe disablement <P>


<a name="column_848"></a>

<A NAME="60418-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that response and for giving an undertaking at the beginning of his speech. He will know as well as I do that an undertaking given by this Government cannot bind any future government. He will also know that it is very much easier to change regulations, very often with no discussion at all, than it is to change primary legislation, which has to go through both Houses of Parliament and be properly discussed. That is one of the reasons why I should like to see this measure on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-18_para21"></a>If my noble friend, as a young man, were sharing a flat with a group of other young men and wished to take out a hire purchase agreement on, say, a saxophone, would he think it fair that the income of the other men sharing the flat with him should be taken into account to see whether or not he can have the loan or the grant to buy the saxophone? That is the sort of thing that my noble friend is asking to be done here. I suggest that only the income of the disabled person and spouse and, if he or she is under the age of 18 years, the parents of the individual, should be taken into account, and not that of everyone else. I do not believe that it is fair to people. I have the feeling that the Treasury is trying to make certain that it does not pay its fair share. However, it is getting late and I do not want to divide the House on this particular point, but I may come back to it later. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 31, line 22, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) In the event that any delay is permitted in complying with a request under subsection (1), no inference of guilt on the part of the accused may be drawn if he chooses to remain silent during the period of the delay.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: This simple amendment is intended to deal with something which is a problem for the Government, as the noble Baroness acknowledged at Second Reading. More importantly, it represents an attempt to mitigate a dangerous potential anomaly in the examination of suspects. As legislation currently stands, reinforced by this Bill, a suspect might be refused access to a solicitor on the basis set out in Section 47, and then have his silence during interrogation, during the 48-hour period before he is allowed to see a solicitor, taken as an inference of guilt. That is the issue on which the European Court of Human Rights found against the Government in the Murray case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para8"></a>At Second Reading the noble Baroness said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"On the narrower question of inferences being drawn at a trial from silence at a time when access to a legal adviser was denied, the court found against the United Kingdom".--[Official Report, 21/3/96; col. 1390.]   </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
She went on to say on that occasion that the Government are considering how best to respond to the judgment in the Murray case, but said, in fairness, that this Bill was not the place to do it. However, as she knows, I warned her on that occasion that we on these Benches might want to revert to the matter at Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para9"></a>What is proposed in this amendment is very simple. It is that no inference of guilt should be drawn from silence during a period in which the suspect is denied access to legal advice. I am sure that the Government acknowledge that the arguments on the conclusions to be drawn from silence are, in all events, finely balanced. But, even if we all wholeheartedly accepted the notion of the imputation of guilt from silence, surely it is belt and braces on the part of the police to expect both to deny legal advice and to be able to argue guilt from the ensuing silence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para10"></a>I well know the pressures of pursuing terrorism wholeheartedly, but I do not believe that we should do so without the restraint of due process. There are some who argue that in pursuing terrorism in Northern Ireland, from the civil liberties point of view, solicitors are deliberately withheld in order to secure confessions and that the weak-minded are threatened by that. If they remain silent they will be convicted, so why not confess straightaway? However, there are others who argue that solicitors may be accomplices to the crime--and there <P>


<a name="column_850"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 850</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have been instances of solicitor malpractice in Northern Ireland--and therefore, once a solicitor is warned, the whole terrorist circle will close up and there will be no further arrests.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para11"></a>I understand both those points of view, but I hope that this is a useful amendment in that it meets both those sets of concerns. The amendment will allow inferences of guilt still to be drawn and legal advice to still be withheld. But it puts a price on the withholding of legal advice so that interviewing officers are invited to use the powers sparingly--for example, only when they genuinely believe that a solicitor may give unhelpful warnings--because there is no question of threatening the weak-minded with inferences of guilt drawn from their silence. Therefore, I believe that this amendment is a sensible lifeline for the Government on a tricky problem. I look forward very much to hearing from the noble Baroness how the Government respond to it. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Prys-Davies: </B>   I support this carefully drafted amendment and I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, has said. I do not want to add to the general argument except to say that fairness is at the heart of justice. The noble Lord, Lord Holme, has referred to the Second Reading debate and in particular to what the Minister said in Hansard at col. 1390. I regret that I was unable to take part in that debate. On reading the paragraph, it seems to me that the Minister accepted that an amendment along these lines is probably needed in order, as I understand it, to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Murray case. As I said, it is also needed in order to ensure fairness to the person who is detained and who has requested access to a solicitor in the circumstances which are set out in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para12"></a>On Second Reading, the Minister said that the Government required more time to conclude their consideration of the best way to proceed. The Minister said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have not yet concluded what steps, legislative and administrative, should be pursued to ensure that we comply with our obligations under the convention".--[Official Report, 21/3/96; col. 1390.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I appreciate that the judgment was given only on 8th February 1996 and that the wheels of departments grind slowly. However, if the Minister is unable to accept the amendment today, I think that the Committee should be told who is now giving that consideration to the relevant matters. Are they being considered by an interdepartmental committee? If so, what departments are represented on it? I presume that the Northern Ireland Office, the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department will be involved. Can the Minister indicate what difficulties, if any, have already been identified? Again, if we miss this opportunity of amending this particular Bill, when do the Government expect that the law can be amended to ensure that we comply with our obligations under the convention? Finally, while this matter is under consideration, can the department give us any assurance that the message of the amendment will be respected and complied with?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-19_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross: </B>   I hope that the noble Baroness will be very careful before she accepts the <P>


<a name="column_851"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 851</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment. I do not now speak as somebody who used to be concerned with the Emergency Provisions Act; I speak much more as somebody who is concerned with the day-to-day application of inferences to be drawn from silence in all the ordinary courts in this country. The 1988 order under which inferences were first introduced in Northern Ireland is not confined to scheduled offences; nor is it confined to detentions under terrorism. In England and Wales the similar provision which was introduced in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 now applies to all offences in magistrates' and Crown courts in those parts of the United Kingdom. The important point is this: those provisions do not apply regardless of the facts under which a silence arose. They are applicable only after discussion by the judge with counsel, and after some sort of agreement about what might be the proper inferences that are to be drawn by the jury if, indeed, any are to be drawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para13"></a>I suggest to the noble Baroness that picking out that particular circumstance and making such a provision in this Bill will invite others to start drawing distinctions between different sets of circumstances which are not provided for either in the 1988 order or in the 1994 Act in England and Wales. It ought to be the subject of a proper discussion between counsel and a judge on a case-by-case basis. I can see no difficulty in the circumstances which the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, set out, whereby counsel could argue that an inference should not be drawn, but I do not believe that there should be a specific legislative provision to that effect. Therefore, I hope that the generality of discretion that is now available to the courts both in Northern Ireland and here will not be diminished by a provision of this sort.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, said, the amendment has been triggered by the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of John Murray. The noble Lord indicated at Second Reading that he would probably table such an amendment. In the judgment, which concerned inferences drawn from silence, the court acknowledged the possibility within the convention of restrictions for good cause on access to a lawyer at the initial stages of police interrogation, but in all the circumstances of the Murray case, taking into account the possibility of inferences from silence, it concluded that to deny access for the first 48 hours of questioning was incompatible with the convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para14"></a>The judgment has implications beyond the emergency legislation, as access to a solicitor may be denied in ordinary criminal cases under PACE. It has implications in England and Wales. I am grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, for putting so clearly the dangers involved in including such an amendment in the Bill. As I explained on Second Reading, we do not believe that the most appropriate response to the judgment would be to amend this Bill in the way proposed. It is a complex matter, requiring liaison with the Home Office, the police and the judiciary in both Northern Ireland and in England and Wales.
<P>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 852</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para15"></a>I can assure the Committee of two things. First, the options for legislative change are being explored. The noble Viscount drew attention to the problems at issue. Secondly, we very much hope that the need to avoid further breaches of the convention will substantially be met by changes to police and prosecution practices. I can understand that noble Lords may be impatient to see a legislative response to the Murray case, but I emphasise that much can, and is, being done in the meantime to ensure that defendants do not have inferences drawn against them from their silence during an interview conducted before they have seen a solicitor. The most obvious step is for the police to be sparing in their use of the power to defer access to a solicitor. Deferrals are now much rarer than they were a few years ago. Even in terrorist cases in Northern Ireland, access to a solicitor nowadays is delayed comparatively rarely in contrast to the position a few years ago. In 1994, of the 1,379 requests for access only 187 were delayed; in 1995, up to the end of September only one request out of 322 was delayed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, asked who was involved in the consultations about the implications for other parts of the jurisdiction in the United Kingdom. The Home Office, the Law Officers and, of course, the Northern Ireland Office are involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-19_para17"></a>I hope that I have been able to give the Committee sufficient assurances that this is not something that we treat lightly. However, we do not believe that such provisions should be included in this Bill. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60418-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness. It is difficult for lay Members of your Lordships' House, when faced with the legal expertise of the Government's advisers and particularly the expertise of the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, who is not only a distinguished lawyer but has a unique knowledge and experience of matters in Northern Ireland, to shout into the gale of that expertise as it comes wafting towards one.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-20_para0"></a>However, I am reassured by what the Minister said about options being explored. I hope that that is the case and that they are being considered actively. We shall certainly want to pursue the noble Baroness and the Government on this matter to ensure that there is some progress. I am vastly reassured that in practice there are very few such denials, at least currently.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-20_para1"></a>However, despite the weight of authority with which it was given, I do not think that I am persuaded by the argument of the noble Viscount which, if I grasped it correctly--I may not have done so--is that when it comes to making judgments, people say, "This is one of the circumstances that you take into account. This chap was silent because he was denied a solicitor. You should therefore draw a different inference about his potential guilt than you would draw had he not been denied one". One takes account of the circumstances which led to the discussion of the imputation of guilt. I should prefer that to be resolved, not on grounds of common sense in the court room or, in the end, of it being a power which is <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60418-20_para7"></a>Clauses 52 and 54 re-enact, in part, Section 61 of the current Act. They place a duty on the Secretary of State to make codes of practice in connection with the detention, treatment, questioning and identification of persons who are detained under the terrorism provisions. The Bill was drafted against the backdrop of a prevailing ceasefire and it omits that part of the existing provision which confers upon the Secretary of State a discretionary power to make codes of practice in connection with the police and Army's powers of arrest, search and seizure, known as the "Part II powers". No such codes were made during the lifetime of the current Act and the ceasefires had seen a significant downturn in the use of the Part II powers. In these circumstances, it was decided that the provision could lapse.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-20_para8"></a>Sadly, however, the Provisional IRA has declared its ceasefire to be over; we have seen a return to violence in the form of recent mainland attacks and we cannot rule out the possibility that the security forces' Part II powers will be needed for some time to come. It is sensible therefore to re-enact the power to create, as necessary, that kind of additional safeguard which codes of practice would provide.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-20_para9"></a>I explained on Second Reading that the Government had reconsidered their position on the discretionary power to make codes of practice in connection with the Part II powers.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-20_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would address a gap in the Bill which exists as drafted. Clause 15 restricts the remission granted under prison rules in respect of those convicted of scheduled offences and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years or more; in such cases remission is restricted to one third of the sentence. Clause 16 requires the court to order that a person imprisoned for a scheduled offence during a period of remission must serve the unexpired portion of the sentence for his previous offence in addition to the sentence for the subsequent offence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-20_para19"></a>Both of those provisions are temporary and Clause 62 now provides that in the event of the expiry or cesser of either provision, its operational effect shall continue in relation to an offence committed while the provision was in force. The intention is that the expiry or cesser should only affect offences committed after that event; the clause does not quite achieve this because we omitted a reference to offences committed before the current provision is enacted but during the lifetime of its predecessor provision.

<A NAME = "60418-21_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in speaking to amendment No. 33, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 34, which is grouped with it.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "60418-21_para4"></a>The reason for moving the amendments is that in Committee on 26th March, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, referred to the provisions which the Government were then proposing replicating to a large extent the regulations for housing benefit. I move these amendments in order to ask what the differences might be. Since there is full provision for such matters in the 1992 Act, I have suggested that that should apply also under this Act. But I merely wish to inquire of the Government whether there are any distinctions and if there are, whether they are immaterial. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, my response to the amendments is that we like things the way they are. We believe that the purpose of the amendments, as we have seen them, is already provided by Clauses 33(8) and 34(5), which allow the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring any information or evidence needed to be provided by any such person as may be prescribed. Therefore, we believe that the effect of the amendments is already covered.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para5"></a>However, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has raised certain detailed points. I should like an opportunity to consider them and cover them in detail and I shall write to her about them.

<P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para11"></a>When the Bill was being discussed in Committee, I said that I would reflect further on two amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that would place a duty on a local authority to tell an applicant how the cost of the grant works is arrived at or why a grant is refused.

Leave out Clause 39.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment Nos. 37 and 38. The purpose of the amendments is to place a duty on local authorities to pay a grant upon satisfactory completion of the works and to remove the delay of 12 months which is proposed for the payment of disabled facilities grants.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para16"></a>Disabled facilities grants are vital to help disabled people remain in their own homes. The provision of suitable housing is a cornerstone of community care policies. In the main, that is achieved through adaptations, because 50 per cent. of all disabled facilities grants involve the redesign of a dwelling, including adaptations to bathrooms, kitchens or other living areas <P>


<a name="column_859"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 859</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by, for example, widening doors. That is essential work which enables a disabled person to live in his own home as independently as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para17"></a>The most serious problem for disabled people who apply for grants is the lengthy wait before there is an assessment and then having to have the application processed before works can begin. Reports of adaptations taking over two years to be completed are not uncommon. That is caused by delays in assessment and processing of grant applications followed by lengthy building works.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para18"></a>The proposals within the Bill would add an extra waiting time into a system which already gives rise to very serious problems in relation to delays. Local authorities would have up to 12 months in which to commence payment from the date of application. As they have an initial six months to agree the application, the proposal would allow a further delay of six months. In most cases where there is a substantial amount of work to be done payment is made in instalments, so that the date on which payments begin is the date on which the work begins. Basically, if a local authority saw fit, the works would not start for a year after the application was made and there would be a further 12 months in which to complete it, so a disabled person would have to wait for two years for the adaptations to be completed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para19"></a>The Government have confirmed that the reason for the extra delay is to allow the local authority to manage its capital. They feel that it will help authorities with their financial management by giving them the discretion to withhold payment of mandatory disabled facilities grants for up to 12 months after the date of application. The Government have further acknowledged that on occasions that may inconvenience the disabled person; but they must strike a balance between inconveniencing the disabled person and inconveniencing the local authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para20"></a>However, there is no support within local authority organisations for the proposals. Both the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the Association of District Councils have stated that they do not support the proposed delay and feel that it is not required. In fact, I understand that, if I had not been persuaded by RADAR to table the amendment, those two organisations would have persuaded another Member of this House to table a similar amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para21"></a>In their joint response to the initial consultation document, those organisations stated that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the hopes and expectations of the disabled person will have been raised with the approval of the grant for work, but the contractor may not be prepared to start work . . . and may then demand a premium or refuse to do the work in prices have risen".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "60418-21_para22"></a>They further stated that contractors.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may then not be prepared to carry out Disabled Facilities Grant work".
The Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation recently contacted the Association of Metropolitan Authorities which confirmed that it still opposes the proposals. If the associations representing local authorities do not want the proposals, why are the Government introducing them for the benefit of local authorities?

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "60418-21_para23"></a>Unfortunately for disabled people who are awaiting adaptations which are urgently required to allow them to live in their own homes the extra delay will be more than just an inconvenience. Many disabled people are waiting in hospital for adaptations to their homes to allow them to leave hospital and return home. That is not only distressing for the individuals involved but it is also very expensive. Department of Health statistics, for example, estimate that a geriatric bed costs over &#163;700 a week. Any delay would, therefore, be costly; but a delay of six months would cost in the region of &#163;20,000. That is surely unreasonable when the only reason is to aid the cashflow of a local authority. The average disabled facilities grant award is for less than &#163;4,000, yet costs of several times that amount could be accrued for a hospital bed while the application is help up. The delay would not only be serious for people in hospital but also for disabled people whose quality of life is very poor because of their housing and because they have considerable care requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para24"></a>Even if local authorities inform the disabled person of when they will be starting the payment, the disabled person will still have to wait. Although the waiting may be slightly less painful if you have some idea when it will end, that is not a tremendous help to someone stuck in hospital or who cannot get out of his own home. The delay itself will still bring tremendous hardship.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-21_para25"></a>Disabled people are already very often waiting a long time for disabled facilities grants. The system requires improvement to shorten those delays rather than lengthening them. To build in an additional delay in payment allegedly to help local authorities with their cashflow, even if the local authority must inform the disabled person of the likely payment date, will cause serious difficulties and hardship. As the disabled facilities grants will be supported by a specific capital grant, this delay, as far as I can see, is neither required nor warranted. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60418-21_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may just point out one of the practical problems involved in such applications. There is a government scheme whereby a 75 per cent. grant is available for replacing lead pipes. I had the problem of replacing lead pipes for part of the estate in my own home. The local authority said, "Yes, you may go ahead and replace them, but we are sorry we have run out of money and can't pay you the grant". Such a situation can sometimes arise. I say that because the end of a financial year for a local authority falls at the end of March. Therefore, by January, the authority may well have run out of money. It may well give a person permission to start the work in March and say, "Yes, you may start the work now, but we are sorry we can't pay you for it until next year". From a purely practical point of view that can indeed be a problem. I agree with my noble friend in that respect.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60418-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend the Minister say to what degree there is <P>


<a name="column_861"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 861</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consultation between the Department of Health and the department which is dealing with the Bill? It seems to me that the major point made by my noble friend Lord Swinfen turns to some extent on what is perhaps a lack of consultation and, indeed, a lack of awareness of the repercussions of the actions of one department on another.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord's amendment. I should like to compliment him on the very admirable and powerful way that he moved it. Indeed, the arguments put forward by the noble Lord are virtually irrefutable. However, I wonder whether the Minister could take on board another aspect which was not stressed by the noble Lord; namely, the impact that the provision in the Bill is likely to have on small businesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-22_para0"></a>We can perhaps imagine the situation as regards the disabled person, the small businessman who is likely to be making the adaptation, providing the facilities, and so on, and the local authority; in other words, there are three parties involved. It seems to me that one of the results of the Bill as it stands is that, yes, the cashflow arrangements for a local authority may be very nicely streamlined and very efficient on paper, but the likely result in terms of the individuals that it affects--in particular, the disabled person and the small businessman--is that they will have to try to fit in with the local authority's timetable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-22_para1"></a>We should think for a moment about the small businessman. The chances are that he is not only undertaking such work for the disabled client; indeed, he is no doubt also undertaking other work. Therefore, it will make sense for him to have the flexibility to negotiate with the disabled person as regards the most convenient time to complete the work and also to take on board his own work schedules as regards the other work that he may be doing. In other words, he will try to undertake the work at a time that is most convenient both to the client and to himself. I am sure that the Government will recognise that that would be a very sensible way of organising the work.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-22_para2"></a>However, because of the way the Bill is written at present such a situation will be turned around. Indeed, both the disable person and the small businessman carrying out the work will be dictated to in terms of when they receive payment from the local authority. It is worth remembering that most local authorities are multi-million pound operations. Even if one takes the housing sector within a local authority, that still constitutes a fairly big business concern, if I may put it that way. Therefore, its ability to accommodate minor changes in its cashflow is surely much better than the ability of a small businessman or, indeed, that of the disabled client in determining their affairs. I hope that the Government will, dare I say it, go along with their own philosophy in terms of providing sensible support and recognising the problems that small businessmen have to face. I also hope that they will look again at matter and perhaps agree to accept the noble Lord's amendment.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I, too, should like to support the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. Local authorities have problems with regard to a large range of demand-led services. Inevitably there are problems as unforeseen demands have to be met as the financial year progresses and budgets are not available. It seems to me that this is the last group of people in respect of whom one should try to alter the balance of those arrangements. If I may say so, this measure is morally misconceived.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-22_para3"></a>I am also puzzled that the Government feel it necessary--if they have to have this clause--to give themselves the opportunity to alter the period of 12 months. I can see the logic of a 12 month period in that it takes one to the same point in the next financial year, but why should the Secretary of State have the possibility of varying that period on a basis which we cannot at this point know, and indeed may never have the opportunity properly to scrutinise? I find that puzzling, but I do not particularly wish to pursue the puzzle because I should like to get rid of the clause altogether.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, I very much agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, said, and indeed with the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has made. It is an odd subsection in a clause of a Bill which specifies,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That date shall not be more than twelve months, or such other period as may be specified by order of the Secretary of State".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "60418-22_para4"></a>Why have that provision in the clause at all? We have no ability to scrutinise the Secretary of State's decision, as the noble Baroness pointed out. I was intrigued by the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, as to whether there had been any discussion between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Health on this matter. At a later stage in the Bill we shall reach a point when I shall ask whether there has been any discussion between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Trade and Industry on the Bill. I wonder whether the Government are speaking with one voice on this matter. I rather doubt it. I should be interested to hear what the noble Lord has to say in reply to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, which basically we support.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend made clear in Committee that he shared the concerns of other noble Lords about Clause 39. I explained that mandatory grants restrict local authorities' ability to maintain control over their resources, and that our purpose in bringing forward Clause 39 was to help local authorities in their financial management. I said that we envisaged the provision would only be used in exceptional circumstances. My noble friend suggested that we give thought to making clearer that the provision should only be used in exceptional circumstances, perhaps by rewording the clause. I share his views on the importance of bringing this message out, but it is simply not an appropriate matter to be placed on the face of the Bill. Rather it is up to us to make it clear in the guidance we shall issue to local authorities explaining the new provisions. This we shall do.
<P>


<a name="column_863"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 863</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-22_para5"></a>This is a clause which is for the benefit of local authorities to enable them to manage their cash flows. If local authorities do not wish to make use of it, they will not do so. They will not need to make use of it, and they will not. If they need to make use of it, we think it is right that this provision should be there so that they can--within a certain limited extent--manage their cash flows. As I said in Committee, this will result in occasional inconvenience for some disabled people. That is a balance which we feel should be struck. However, it will not result in great inconvenience for contractors. They will know--and the disabled person will know--when the money is to be paid. The local authority has to say when the money is to be paid so they will know when the money is going to be there. It will be up to the contractor to decide whether he does the work early and waits for payment, or whether he waits until the money is there before doing the work. There will be no uncertainty.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving way, but I wonder whether he appreciates the situation. It may be that there is some certainty as to when the money will be paid, but the Minister needs to recognise that there are other criteria to be taken into account. A small businessman may decide that the work will take two weeks to complete, and therefore he will start the work two weeks before the date on which payment can be made. But what happens if the work takes either a shorter or longer time, and that confuses the date of payment? The whole matter is a case of effectively dictating to the small businessman and the disabled person rather than allowing them the flexibility to adjust the time in which the work is done to the best convenience of both parties involved.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, to a certain extent the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, is right. Of course this is not perfect in terms of the convenience of the disabled person or the contractor. But, as I said, we feel that is a balance which should be struck. As regards the power to vary the 12 month period, this would be done by negative resolution. It is felt wise to have this power to allow for unknown possibilities that may lie ahead. In case this proves to be the wrong time limit in practice, we felt that we should have in place in the legislation the power to vary it. However, we have no current intention to vary it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-22_para6"></a>As regards relations with the Department of Health, I can assure noble Lords that they are excellent. We have to work closely with the Department of Health on these matters. This is very much an inter-departmental area and we feel that we work extremely well and closely with the department. I am afraid that I agreed with my noble friend Lord Balfour that it is just a fact of life that money may be short one year and one has to postpone some expenditure into the next year. Local authorities face that sort of difficulty with their budgets, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has said. In imposing a mandatory grant upon them, we feel that we should allow them the flexibility they will need to escape from a financial bind in exceptional circumstances.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, will he respond to the point that the 12 month norm which is in the Bill at the moment is <P>


<a name="column_864"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 864</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>really not required by local authorities? I am advised by local authority associations that this is not needed. If it is in the Bill, it is wrongly looked on as a norm. Perhaps the Government would reconsider--given the problems raised by my noble friend Lord Monkswell, and indeed others--the cash flow problems, because I am advised (as I say, deliberately) that local authorities and, recently, local authority associations do not consider the 12 month limit in the Bill to be appropriate.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60418-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, certainly I shall look at the situation when we have finished with the Report stage of this Bill. If it turns out that local authorities have risen up as a body and demanded the abolition of this 12 month rule which is there for their benefit--in exceptional circumstances--I do not doubt that we shall take cognisance of that. But if they are demanding it they have not told me, and if they have not told me they cannot expect me to know about it.
<P>

However, like the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, I have also heard that local authorities do not require this measure in the Bill. They feel they can manage perfectly adequately without having the power to delay payment by up to a year. I do not think my noble friend, or possibly his advisers, have taken into account that with delays in putting the work in hand there will possibly be rises in costs due to inflation, no matter how small. Materials rise in cost and therefore when the work comes to be done the funds are not available.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para0"></a>My noble friend Lord Balfour pointed out that local authorities may run out of funds. They may run out of funds but they are able to plan their work ahead in this area because it takes some months to get the assessment done. There are also instances of local authorities spending money rather wastefully towards the end of the financial year because they are desperate to spend it to make certain they get the Government grant so they have the same amount to spend the following year. That is because the Treasury has not yet learnt that a good housekeeper is able to spread her money over more than one week, or more than one month, or more than one year, and to do the job properly. It might be an idea to have a good housewife as the senior civil servant in the Treasury. I know that my wife manages to make me far more sensible with money than I would be otherwise.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para1"></a>I believe that my noble friend should give this matter further consideration. It is a totally unnecessary clause in the Bill. It is rather insulting in suggesting to local authorities that they cannot manage their affairs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para2"></a>Because of this clause, the odd, poorly-managed local authority may use the provision as an excuse to delay payment for its own purposes, for one reason or another. Without this clause, it would not have that reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para3"></a>I was tempted to divide the House, but the hour is late. My noble friend has said that he will give the matter consideration. Therefore, I shall not risk having the House counted out. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "60418-23_para11"></a>I have received a number of letters from the noble Lord on various matters with regard to the Bill. I am not sure that this specific item has been covered.

<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para12"></a>I do not wish to go into the arguments put forward in Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to return to this matter. The noble Lord is right in saying that he raised the issue in Committee, and we promised to consider it and come back to it. And come back to it we now have. I am happy to give the noble Lord the assurance that this is an issue which we feel should be covered in guidance. This is not a matter that we find sufficiently simple or straightforward to set out on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para13"></a>As I am sure the noble Lord, with his accountancy skills, will realise, the matter is complicated. Contractors not registered for VAT are still required to pay VAT on the materials they acquire. On the other hand, VAT-registered contractors recover costs that they incur. In providing for equal treatment of competing estimates, we would also wish to see that covered. We would expect guidance to cover all the matters which an authority should take into account when assessing estimates submitted with grant applications. This should stress the need for genuine and full competition of estimates covering issues such as VAT registration as well as the reputation of the contractor and his ability to carry out the works to a good standard and in good time.

I may have received such a letter. However, I am bound to say to the noble Lord that I received copies of many letters sent by the noble Lord since Committee stage. I may have missed that one. Nonetheless, the argument is made. The fact that there is a ministerial record of what has been said this evening will be helpful. If that is in guidance, so be it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para16"></a>I think that there is nothing between the noble Lord and me. We believe that it is right that there should be fair and proper competition between contractors. If that is properly expressed in guidance, given what the noble Lord said in a House of Parliament this evening, I am sure that the courts will take due notice of this in interpreting anything that may come out in guidance. I am grateful to the noble Lord for what he has said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para20"></a>Amendment No. 40 extends the circumstances set out in Clause 45 in which grant may be recalculated, withheld or repaid. Our intention is to cover the situation where an applicant was awarded an erroneous amount of grant. Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, would amend Clause 46 to cover a similar situation and also the case where the applicant deliberately has given false information or withheld information to gain excess grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams, spoke to two similar amendments tabled in his name at Committee stage. We considered that the noble Lord's amendments raised a point which the Bill did not adequately address and I said in Committee that we would give further thought to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para22"></a>Amendment No. 40 is the result of our deliberations. In bringing forward this amendment, we are seeking to take on board the concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Williams. We believe that Clause 45 is a more appropriate place to deal with the case where the wrong amount of grant has been awarded since that clause already addresses those cases where an authority is able to redetermine the amount of grant, withhold grant or require it to be repaid. By contrast, Clause 46--which the noble Lord's amendments would amend--deals only with cases where an applicant was not entitled to any grant of the description in question.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-23_para23"></a>The noble Lord's Amendment No. 42 seeks to cover a specific circumstance--deliberately giving false information or withholding information. We remain of the view that much of this ground is already covered by subsections (2) to (6) of Clause 46 and by way of common law, and we see no need for the noble Lord's amendment.

I accept that they may well be covered in common law but nevertheless certain things in Clause 46 could be put into the Bill rather than left to the common law procedures. That said, the Government have gone as far as I can expect in this instance and no doubt the matter will be raised in another place when the Bill goes there.

<A NAME = "60418-24_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Dubs. I apologise for breaking the grouping, but it was a matter of moving from one amendment to another rather quickly. Therefore I wish at the same time as speaking to Amendment No. 45 to speak to Amendment No. 43, which I did not move, and Amendment No. 46. The purpose is to remove the necessity for the Secretary of State to consent to a local authority using its discretion under this section to waive grant repayment, subject to the local authority reporting its action to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para9"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that a similar amendment was discussed at Committee stage to remove the Secretary of State's consent altogether. In response, it appeared that the Government wished to adjust their view on two grounds--first, the need for nationally consistent criteria and, secondly, the need in order to consider changes to Clause 57, for the Secretary of State to keep himself informed, or to be kept informed, about the case of such discretion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para10"></a>We are not entirely happy about that. Nationally consistent criteria are not appropriate, in our view, in decisions on whether to waive grant repayment which are made in the light of specific local knowledge. This is not something that can be nationally determined. The most frequent circumstances in which local authorities waive repayment are when a property is sold and there is not enough equity in the property to allow the repayment of grant as well as outstanding mortgage costs. In those cases, many councils--and I give the example of Bradford--would waive repayment, particularly where the cost of grant was not equal to any subsequent increase in the value of properties. I hope it goes without saying that in the city areas that is a problem. It is therefore, in our view, unreasonable for the Secretary of State to try to impose national criteria which apply across the board on what local authorities should do. We believe that that should be left to local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para11"></a>The second issue is how the Secretary of State should be kept informed. We believe that local authorities should report on how they use their discretion to waive repayment. The Secretary of State can then consider whether changes to Clause 57 are necessary in the light of the reports from local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para12"></a>I apologise for not having moved Amendment No. 43, but it and Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 basically cover the same problem. I should be grateful if the noble Lord <P>


<a name="column_869"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 869</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could respond when he has received advice from the proper quarters on the points that I have made. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I spoke at some length on this subject at Committee stage and do not plan to go through all arguments that I raised then. I hope that the Government will treat the amendments sympathetically. I wish to make one point to reinforce the arguments of my noble friend Lord Williams.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para13"></a>Depending on the situation of the local authority, that authority may take a decision that it will be good policy in the locality to waive repayment of grants. There are two reasons for that: first, there may be a history of instability of employment in the area. The council knows that the chances of someone being made redundant or falling into unemployment are quite high. There is also the consequent chance of people from the area finding work elsewhere and moving house. Secondly, we need to recognise the community benefit that accrues from modernisation and improvement of derelict private housing. We may think in terms of the crime and vandalism which can quite often become endemic where a whole area is run down. That lays costs on the local authority and the local community in dealing with the problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para14"></a>The local authority can get a policy going, with an interesting archetypal public-private initiative involving public and private finance, to regenerate an area through the deployment of home improvement grants. If the local authority does that, people may put investment into their houses and use home improvements grants in the knowledge that they will not be penalised if, through force of circumstances, they have to move out of the area. That will provide tremendous benefit to the local community which will outweigh the expenditure of the grant money which in other areas would be clawed back. I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to the amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, it is a condition of grant that where there is a disposal of the property, other than in certain specified circumstances, during the condition period, grant should be repaid. Clauses 48, 49 and 50 each contain a provision allowing a determination to be made not to demand repayment--or to demand a lesser amount.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para15"></a>The amendments would transfer the power to make such a determination to the local authority, without a requirement for the Secretary of State's consent. The authority would, instead, notify the Secretary of State of its action and of the reasons for making the determination.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para16"></a>We believe it is right that, except in certain circumstances over which the grant applicant has little or no control, the recipient of a grant should be asked to repay the grant if the purposes for which he received it no longer apply. The Secretary of State has a duty to safeguard the public purse in making sure that resources allocated are used for the purpose intended.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para17"></a>We have sought to exclude the most commonly occurring circumstances in which it would be unreasonable to demand grant repayment in Clause 57, <P>


<a name="column_870"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 870</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which sets out the categories of disposal exempt from the repayment condition. We have also provided, in Clause 48(5), for the local authority to use its discretion not to demand repayment where the disposal is made necessary by age or infirmity.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para18"></a>We accept that there could be other circumstances not covered by these provisions where it would be unreasonable to demand repayment or to demand the full amount, and that the local authority will wish to make a case for a waiver of a demand.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para19"></a>If the principle of repayment is to be applied fairly, it is desirable that, as far as possible, there should be parity of treatment between grant applicants, regardless of where they live or where their property is situated. We believe that the Secretary of State is best placed to ensure such parity of treatment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para20"></a>It will be for the local authority to decide that a case for a waiver should be made, but if each case is referred to the Secretary of State for consent, he will be able to ensure that the same criteria are applied in reaching a decision, for the whole country.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para21"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, would require notification to the Secretary of State of the action taken by authorities and of the reasons for their action. However, while that would keep him informed of the circumstances arising in which action is likely to be required, there would appear to be, in practice, little that the Secretary of State could do if he were unhappy with the local authority's actions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para22"></a>For the reasons given, I believe there to be a need for the Secretary of State to retain overall control of the use of grant resources and that, as part of that control, he should have the final say in whether or not a demand for repayment of grant on breach of the disposal condition should be made. That is not only for reasons of Treasury but for reasons of fairness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-24_para23"></a>I appreciate that my reply may not entirely satisfy the noble Lord. However, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME = "60418-25_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Clause 45 allows a local housing authority to impose conditions on its approval of an application for grant but those conditions are to be subject to the consent of the Secretary of State. I seek to remove the requirement for the Secretary of State's consent. This amendment is grouped with Amendments Nos. 50 and 51, to which no doubt the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, will speak when moving what is perhaps a slightly more moderate amendment than mine.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-25_para6"></a>When we discussed this matter in Committee, I commented that the provision seemed to add to the Secretary of State's own administrative caseload. I said that that was perhaps a matter for him and not for me. On reflection, I should have said that it was a matter for me. It is a matter for all noble Lords. After all, we are all concerned with good administration. As I read this provision, it requires consent in every particular case. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, may tell me that that is not so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-25_para7"></a>At that time I asked, if the Government were not minded to concede the point, whether the Minister would explain how the power was to be used; and in particular whether the Government proposed to give umbrella consents--in other words, consents covering specific categories.

<P>

<A NAME = "60418-25_para9"></a>In Committee, as noble Lords may recall, we sought to remove entirely the requirement for the Secretary of State's consent.

On different occasions the Government have argued in different ways. I am not quite sure whether we stand on that point. I am quite satisfied that a balance has to be struck between discretion on the part of local authorities and the need for national consistency.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-25_para10"></a>Nevertheless, it seems to me that in this case the Government have got it wrong. If local authorities are to use the grant system flexibly in support of their local aims and to maximise the system's effectiveness in meeting specific local housing need, they really must be free to do so without seeking the Secretary of State's consent in every conceivable instance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-25_para11"></a>The Government rejected our argument in Committee, so we are offering a slightly modified version. The amendment to which I speak would have three purposes. First, it would remove the requirement to seek the Secretary of State's consent when a local housing authority imposes additional conditions on grant aid. It would seek also to make the exercise of discretion by local authorities the subject of guidance by the Secretary of State. So it is a gentler amendment than those we moved in Committee. But it would also require the Secretary of State to consult before the issue of such guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-25_para12"></a>If I had my choice, I should go with the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, since that was the one we moved in Committee. Nevertheless, I offer a slightly reduced, milder amendment in the hope that the Government may concede an inch or two on this matter.

<A NAME = "60418-25_para13"></a>Having listened carefully to what was said in Committee and looked carefully at the amendments, we still hold to the way in which matters are set out in the Bill. My noble friend Lord Ferrers explained in Committee the importance that we attach to ensuring consistency of approach and the need for there to be some control over the rate and nature of the changes to the grant system that the imposition of conditions represents.

<A NAME = "60418-25_para14"></a>There is an important obligation on the Secretary of State to protect grant applicants from unfair or unreasonable conditions being applied by a local authority or access to grant being prevented by the application of such conditions. Allowing conditions to be imposed only with the consent of the Secretary of State will provide this reassurance which we believe grant applicants deserve.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-25_para15"></a>But we expect that there will be wide-ranging general consents and umbrella consents covering such conditions as nomination rights on grant improved properties, the recovery of specialised equipment, insurance on grant improved property and the maintenance of improved property. We see those umbrella consents under the control of the Secretary of State providing much of the flexibility that local authorities will need. But we believe that the ultimate control of the use of such consents should be with the Secretary of State.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down perhaps I may say how sorry I am to raise this matter.

I very much hope that in future the Minister will refrain from what I regard as rather silly comments about the relative standing of different political parties.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has answered the point about umbrella consents which prompted me to table the amendment in the same form as various noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, and myself, put forward an amendment at the last stage. I am glad to hear that there will be general consents.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-25_para16"></a>Can the Minister give an assurance now that there will be consultation with the local authority associations in fairly short order with regard to those general consents? While conceding that the Government are to keep central control of the matter, I am sure that they would want to keep control in a way that does not cause falling out with the local authorities.

<A NAME = "60418-25_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a new subject that we did not discuss at Committee stage and this is a probing amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-25_para20"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to place a duty on a local housing authority to produce information on the house renovation grants, common parts grants, disabled facilities grants, HMO grants and group repair and home repair assistance in accessible formats; in other words, in large print, braille, audio cassette or sign language. It is also intended to comply with the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act.

<A NAME = "60418-25_para22"></a>The amendment deals specifically with the needs of visually impaired people. However, as the House will know, there is also a need to cater for people who do not read or speak English, of whom there are a considerable number in this country.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment. It is only too easy to forget how difficult it is for people in local authority areas to understand how a local authority operates. It is a bureaucratic system which most people find quite hard to penetrate, even with those local authorities which are as receptive as possible to local feeling. Therefore, any amendment which obliges local authorities to publish in simple terms the basis on which they make any grants available can only be for the better. It seems to me that the very people who would benefit from the system are those who would say, "Well, the easier it is for us to understand what the local authority is up to, the better the system works". This is a very simple proposition and I support it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendment. It is wonderful when an amendment put forward to take into account the point of view of disabled people provides a positive benefit to the able-bodied members of our society.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-26_para0"></a>The provision follows from our earlier debate on Amendment No. 1 at the beginning of this part of the Bill, when I argued the importance of local authorities having a policy and a scheme set out on the basis of local circumstances to determine how their discretion would work. This amendment will enable that mechanism to work effectively by providing to the local community a simple explanation of what happens under the local authority's discretionary grant system and how it works. That is inevitably likely to lead to debate and discussion and no doubt improvement and modification as time goes on, depending on the changes in local circumstances.

<P>
<A NAME="60418-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend's amendment introduces a new Clause 61 which would require a local housing authority to publish information on the house renovation grant system. I do not feel that primary legislation is the most suitable vehicle to achieve that aim.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-26_para1"></a>We already provide guidance to local authorities under the present legislation, encouraging them to make suitable literature available to inquirers and we intend to continue to issue such advice to accompany this legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-26_para2"></a>My noble friend's amendment would also require that a local authority produce such information:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the preferred reading medium of a member of the public".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That could require the individual authorities to provide literature in any medium requested by a member of the public. That could have significant cost implications. Although it is sensible to produce such literature which is suitable to the needs of a disabled person, it is very much a matter for the authority to decide itself after taking account of the likely demand for such literature. The desirability of such an objective however will also be covered in future guidance. I hope that gives my noble friend the comfort he requires.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, it goes quite a long way towards doing that. A lot of the information that one would expect to be provided will be similar from one authority to another. It may be possible for local authority organisations to get together and produce in various formats--sign language and video cassettes--something that will give everyone the basics; it is the basics that people want to enable them to understand what is happening and how to apply it. In the light of what my noble friend has said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dubs </B>   moved Amendment No. 60:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 39, line 8, leave out from ("it") to end of line 9 and insert ("comprises a minimum of two dwellings and satisfies the conditions prescribed for qualifying buildings in relation to a group repair scheme.

Before making any regulations under subsection (2) above the Secretary of State shall consult such organisations as he considers to be representative of local housing authorities.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-26_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now turn to the part of the Bill concerning group repair schemes; namely, schemes which allow a local authority to repair the exterior of buildings to which the scheme relates.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-26_para12"></a>The purpose of the amendment is twofold. First, it seeks to add flexibility to the operation of the clause. As the clause stands, it requires the scheme to apply to four dwellings and the purpose of the amendment is to reduce the number of dwellings covered by the provision to a minimum of two. Secondly, the clause, as amended, would require consultation before the Secretary of State makes changes to the definition of qualifying buildings for the purposes of the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-26_para13"></a>As I said, the purpose of the amendment is to add flexibility to a proposal which has merit, but which would otherwise be rather rigid in its application. Limiting the proposal to four or more houses may miss out worthwhile approaches where four houses do not stand next to each other yet they require the group repair scheme to apply to their exteriors.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-26_para14"></a>The provision is sensible. It would enable the grant system to cover everything from a single pair of semi-detached houses to a whole street of terraced houses, provided three-quarters of the properties were in disrepair externally. I believe it makes sense. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, this amendment seeks to specify on the face of the Bill that a qualifying building in a group repair scheme must comprise a minimum of two dwellings, compared with the present minimum of four, and it removes the requirement that additional qualifying buildings satisfy conditions prescribed by the Secretary of State. It also makes it a statutory requirement for local authority organisations to be consulted before any regulations are made on group repair.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-26_para15"></a>We recognise that the main aim behind this amendment is to simplify the conditions for a group repair scheme. As previously indicated by my noble friend Earl Ferrers in his reply to earlier amendments, we have some sympathy with this aim of simplifying the conditions for a group repair scheme. However, as my noble friend said at the time we would prefer to leave the detailed rules and conditions to be prescribed in regulations rather than set out on the face of the Bill. <P>


<a name="column_877"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 877</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Beyond anything else, that would give us the chance to consult local authorities and others. However, we will certainly look at the possibility of reducing the minimum number of dwellings in a scheme when we come to make the regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-26_para16"></a>The amendment also provides for statutory consultation with local authority organisations on proposed regulations on group repair. We do not think that is necessary. It is our general practice to consult local authority associations on proposals affecting their members. We have, for example, recently established a new working group comprising local authority representatives to provide a forum for consultation on private sector housing renewal strategies. The purpose of this group is to assist us with the drafting of new guidance for local authorities which will be required as a consequence of the Bill. I hope that that explanation reassures the noble Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-26_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for agreeing to go at least part of the way to meet the purpose of the amendment. I am happy that he is looking at the matter sympathetically and therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<BR>
(2) The Secretary of State may specify matters to be taken into account by a local housing authority when carrying out a Neighbourhood Renewal Assessment for the purposes of subsection (1).
<BR>
(3) The Secretary of State may for the purpose of subsection (1) additionally specify different matters to be taken into account in a Neighbourhood Renewal Assessment for different types of scheme and in different areas.
<BR>
(4) Where a Neighbourhood Renewal Assessment confirms that the carrying out of a group repair scheme is the most satisfactory course of action, the local authority may proceed to carry out the work specified in the scheme after obtaining the prior consent of persons participating in it and resolving to approve the scheme.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-26_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment also concerns group repair schemes. The purpose of the amendment is to remove the needs for specific consent from the Secretary of State for group repair schemes and simplify the process by substituting a requirement that such schemes shall be subject to a cost benefit analysis specified in neighbourhood renewal assessment. Although there seems to be an element of jargon in the alternative approach, it seems to be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut to have the Secretary of State give specific consent for a scheme of this kind. My amendment would simplify the process by taking away from the Secretary of State the burden of having to approve every scheme that might be put before him and suggesting an alternative way whereby such schemes should be approved. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>participants provided they can give possession of the part of the building to which the works relate or, if that part is occupied, they have the consent of the occupier.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-27_para3"></a>As currently drafted, Clause 67 enables a person to qualify for assistance under a group repair scheme if, in the case of a dwelling, he gives an owner occupation certificate or a certificate of intended letting or, in the case of a house in multiple occupation, he gives a certificate of future occupation. However, a person who is unable to give such a certificate--for example, because he intends to sell his property in the near future--might still wish to participate in the scheme as an unassisted participant, but he would at present be precluded from doing so. In some cases this may prevent a viable scheme from being put together. These amendments will remove that restriction, allowing owners to join in and benefit from group repair works, even though they will have to meet the full costs themselves, provided they can give access to the property.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-27_para4"></a>Amendment No. 64 makes it clear that in the case of houses in multiple occupation assistance will be available only if the property is occupied for residential purposes other than holiday occupation.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-27_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is also concerned with group repair schemes. It seeks to allow persons who are unable to join a group repair scheme at the time it was approved still to be eligible to participate in the scheme provided their properties are close to the approved scheme buildings and provided the additional works can be completed without unreasonable disruption to the building contract. What we are seeking to do is to add flexibility. We are seeking to ensure that we deal with a difficulty that arises when adjacent properties in external disrepair have to be excluded from the building to be approved because the owners are unwilling or unable to participate. It is really to stop too rigid a system so that it is possible quickly to allow late joiners to participate in a scheme that has already been approved. I am sure that it meets the spirit of what the Government have in mind. I hope that in practice the amendment will help to achieve that aim. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, this amendment would enable persons to join an approved group repair scheme without the need to obtain fresh scheme approval, if it were reasonable to include them. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden of seeking fresh approval where people change their minds and wish to take part in a scheme once it is under way. While I have some sympathy with this aim, there are obvious problems. For instance, the late inclusion of additional participants could upset the basis on which the original approval was <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60418-27_para13"></a>Under Clause 73, it is a condition of participation in a group repair scheme as an assisted participant that the property is occupied in accordance with the intention specified in the certificate of owner-occupation, certificate of intended letting or certificate of future occupation, as the case may be. If not, the owner may be required to pay the balance of the cost. Amendment No. 73 provides that this condition will cease to apply if the owner disposes of the property for reasons which are largely beyond his control, but will remain in force if the owner transfers the property to another member of their family or to certain other close associates. This is to deter people from avoiding the conditions of assistance by transferring the property between family members.

<A NAME = "60418-27_para14"></a>Amendment No. 75 makes clear that once the obligation to pay the balance of the cost of the works has arisen as a result of a breach of one of the grant conditions, and the amount demanded, if any, has been paid, the obligation is discharged.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-27_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 69 to 72. During Committee stage on 26th March, my noble friend Lord Ferrers promised the noble Lord, Lord Williams, that we would look again at whether local authorities should be given greater discretion not to demand full payment of the balance of the cost of group repair works if the owner of a property disposes of it within the five-year protected period.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-27_para17"></a>As my noble friend said, we recognise the concern among local authorities that the requirement to pay the balance of the cost might deter some people from joining a group repair scheme if they were uncertain as to whether they could meet the conditions. We want to encourage authorities to take a strategic approach to renewal. Amendments Nos. 68, 69, 71 and 72 will help to increase the flexibility of group repair by giving local authorities full discretion in determining the amount, if any, to be recovered from participants if the property is disposed of during the five-year protected period. We believe this goes further than Amendment No. 70, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, which would require authorities to specify the sort of cases in which they would exercise their discretion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-27_para18"></a>Although we would still expect authorities to demand payment where the owner can clearly afford it, they will be able to waive or abate payments where payment in full would cause hardship. If those who are considering whether to join a group repair scheme are made aware of the local authority's policy on this at the outset, it should help to give them the assurance that they need to join in the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-27_para19"></a>We have thought it right in making this change to tighten the payment condition where property is disposed of under a will or on intestacy. As currently worded, the requirement in Clause 72 to pay the balance of the cost continues in force if the property vests under a will or on intestacy to a person who lived with the deceased before his death. However, we see no reason why the condition should not also continue in force if the property vests in some other person. That person will clearly be inheriting a valuable asset and, if he <P>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>fall into a priority group, are on low income benefit, or are elderly, or disabled or who require minor repairs or adaptations to enable them to remain in their own home. It will also, as I understand it, be available for insulation works, replacing lead pipes, and Radon-associated works.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-28_para13"></a>The MWA grant--if I may use that acronym--is discretionary. It is proposed that the home repair grant will be too. Minor works assistance grant has been useful and much appreciated. The problem I put forward is that the level of grant does not cover certain works. The cost of work to enable people to stay put will depend upon the condition of the property, local costs in the area and the frailty, mobility or otherwise of the applicant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-28_para14"></a>Home improvement agencies have in the past expressed concern that the grant of about &#163;1,000 was too low. The figure was set, I think, in April 1991 and has not been increased since. There is a proposal to increase that to &#163;2,000 for any one year and &#163;4,000 for any three years. That is welcome, but there are concerns about works which may exceed &#163;2,000.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-28_para15"></a>Furthermore, the proposal to limit the grant to payments of &#163;2,000 in any one year may prevent it from being applied when works are required when they are most needed. In addition, assisting with community care, which is a question which has exercised your Lordships' House on many occasions, seems to be left out of the considerations in this new measure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-28_para16"></a>It is proposed that the HRG limit should be &#163;4,000 in any three years, but if that is proposed it seems unreasonable that it should not be payable at the time it is most needed. That is, after all, the point of the exercise. The amendment would retain the overall limit of &#163;4,000 in any three years but there would be no limit to the amount available in any one year. We believe that that is right. The removal of the one-year limit will, of course, remove an arbitrary time limit on the grant, and that could militate against advantageous effects. I hope that the Minister is seized of these problems, and, unlike on previous amendments, will be able to respond with due consideration. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-28_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lucas:  </B>   My Lords, the amendments address the limit for home repair assistance. Each application for home repair assistance will be subject to a proposed limit of &#163;2,000. That is a limit per application, not per year. One can receive two grants in the same year; one can use up one's &#163;4,000 limit in the same year. We would have concerns were authorities giving grants above this limit as a matter of routine, as we believe the limit accurately reflects the extent of works deemed suitable for this type of passported assistance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-28_para17"></a>There is also a further limit of &#163;4,000 per dwelling over a three-year period. Should the full &#163;4,000 of assistance be given in response to one application as would be possible under Amendment No. 80 and would be possible by having two coming together, no further assistance could be given until the three-year period had expired. In our opinion, this would leave the applicant vulnerable should the need for further works arise. We have set the structure of the grant so that such a situation is discouraged.

<A NAME = "60418-28_para18"></a>Turning toward Amendment No. 81, it is our belief that the flexibility already offered by this clause is the best option for this type of passported assistance. I do not believe that it is either necessary or helpful to be tied to a particular cost index derived from the construction industry. The grant limits we propose are considered adequate for the works we intend to be assisted through home repair assistance. When we feel this is no longer the case, there is a provision within the Bill for the limits to be increased. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

I am puzzled as to what Clause 86 achieves other than imposing extra bureaucracy. It allows the Secretary of State--it does not require him--to make an order, to make certain provisions. If the clause is necessary, I should have expected to see that the Secretary of State "shall" make an order dealing with those matters. If it is not necessary, then I should prefer the clause not to be there.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-29_para23"></a>My amendment seeks to give local authorities the choice as to whether or not they make use of the Secretary of State's scheme. When I moved an amendment directed at the same point in Committee the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, said that he thought that a better approach would be to give local authorities flexibility as provided in Clause 86(6). But that is a limited provision and it provides that local housing authorities will not be precluded from taking immediate action where that is required, nor would anything require an authority to disclose information if that were against the public interest. In other words, I do not feel that that point in any way met the concern that I raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-29_para24"></a>Having proposed that the matter shall be for guidance, I have chosen what seems to be appropriate wording to alter subsequent parts of the clause in the following amendments. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60418-29_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, yet again, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has bounced us with a set of starred amendments. She has spoken eloquently to them and I am glad to say that, this time, we have guessed right as to what the amendments are about. The noble Baroness has made a most interesting point and it is one to which we would like to give further and serious consideration. We will return to the noble Baroness on the matter before the next stage. Therefore, in view of that assurance, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

(a) a deferred action notice, or a notice of an authority's decision to renew a deferred action notice, or

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60418-29_para27"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment inserts a new clause which is similar in effect to that in Section 614 of the Housing Act 1985, which provides for the Secretary of State to prescribe forms. It is that provision under which prescribed forms regulations have been made for use by local authorities in respect of the existing fitness enforcement options of repair, closure and clearance. For those who like details, the statutory instrument in question is 1990 No. 1730.

<P>

<A NAME = "60418-30_para7"></a>Clause 92 enables the Secretary of State to recover contributions paid to a local authority for grants in respect of which repayments have been made to the authority, or could have been recovered if reasonable steps had been taken. It is for the Secretary of State to <P>


<a name="column_889"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column 889</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>determine what steps it would have been reasonable for an authority to take. Amendment No. 104 provides similar powers for recovery of contributions made to authorities for group repair schemes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-30_para8"></a>Amendment No. 106 provides that, in determining whether an authority has taken reasonable steps to recover payments, the Secretary of State can take into account whether it has properly exercised its discretion not to demand payment or to demand payment of a lesser sum.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-30_para9"></a>It is not the purpose of the provision to intervene in the lawful exercise by local authorities of their power of waiver. The provision is to ensure that where the discretion to waiver is exercised improperly, the cost of failing to recover the grant, or part of the grant, falls locally and not on the taxpayer at large.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-30_para10"></a>It would appear from Amendment No. 105, brought forward by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, that there is concern over the provision in Clause 92(3) which allows the Secretary of State to determine what reasonable steps should be taken to recover grant. We share the noble Lord's concerns over what might be considered as stark wording in the provision as drafted. It is due to the noble Lord drawing attention to the matter in this way that we have given consideration to how the intent of the provision might be clarified. That has led to the government amendments that I have described. In view of what I have said, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to resist moving his amendment when the time comes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418-30_para11"></a>Amendment No. 177 relates to the transitional provisions which will be required under Clause 100 for the change from the current renovation grant system to the one contained in Part I of the Bill. Under Clause 100, certain applications for mandatory grant made after introduction of the Bill and before commencement of Part I will be treated as applications for discretionary grant under the current legislation. Amendment No. 177, combined with Clause 100(5), puts beyond doubt that we will have the power to make all the appropriate transitional changes to the current legislation. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for introducing these amendments.

<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para2"></a>I am replying to your parliamentary Question in which you expressed concern that the Special Report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration implied that the Child Support Agency is understaffed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para3"></a>Paragraph 10 of that report says that there might be planned reductions from the current level of staffing. In fact, the number of staff employed by the agency has steadily increased for each of its three years of existence, as was always envisaged. At 31/3/94, the agency employed 4,685 staff. At 31/3/95, the agency employed 5,695 staff. At 31/1/96, the agency employed 6,299.

<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para9"></a>As Peter Mathison is on leave at the moment, I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary Questions asking whether Her Majesty's Government will give further consideration to the suggestion made by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (PCA) in paragraph 11 of Appendix 2 (pp 55-56, case No. 99/95) of his third report (Investigation of Complaints against the Child Support Agency) that an automatic procedure be established whereby the Benefits Agency (BA) would notify the relevant housing department when a termination of income support has ceased to apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para10"></a>When an income support (IS) award is terminated, the IS Computer System (ISCS), where appropriate, automatically produces a notification of the cessation of the award for issue to the housing department of the local authority (LA).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418w01_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Rankeillour </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What progress is being made in securing improvements in the common fisheries policy and the management of fisheries in the UK.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60418w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>  Structural Measures for the Fishing Industry
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para13"></a>The main underlying problem for fishermen is the poor state of fish stocks and the size of the fishing fleets. Tackling the problem of over-capacity must remain a top priority in fisheries policy, since our fleet cannot have a viable long-term future unless it is properly structured in relation to the available fishing opportunities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para14"></a>That is why we increased the decommissioning programme by &#163;28 million last year and have recently launched a consultation exercise seeking industry views <P>


<a name="column_WA82"></a>

<B>18 Apr 1996 : Column WA82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on how our decommissioning arrangements might be improved. The closing date for comments is 12th April and we aim to have changes in place in time to start the 1996 round soon.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para15"></a>If our fleet reductions are to work, they need to be part of an EU-wide policy; and we shall be joining constructively in the discussions and negotiations in the Fisheries Council on the future arrangements for bringing the European fleet as a whole better into line with fishing opportunities. We have already started discussions by holding seven meetings in different parts of the UK to enable the European Commission to meet our industry and to hear at first hand the views of our fishermen.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para16"></a>The need to adapt applies equally to ports and on-shore facilities and to the processing industry. We have therefore announced that we are going ahead with grant support schemes under the EC's Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance. This is in addition to the continuing national harbour grants scheme and existing vessel safety measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para17"></a>The UK will also benefit by up to &#163;36 million of aid under the PESCA initiative, targeted specially at the needs of fishery dependent areas. Again there will be supporting national, regional and local assistance. 
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para18"></a>Fisheries Management
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para19"></a>On the management of fisheries the Government have made clear their determination to deal with the problem of quota hoppers. These vessels, although registered in the UK, are effectively owned abroad yet fish against UK quotas and yield little or no benefit to our fishing communities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para20"></a>Quota hoppers now account for 20 per cent. of the tonnage of our offshore fleet and take about 10 per cent. of our whitefish quota, most of which is landed abroad. This cannot go on and we must be able to ensure that our fishing communities and related industries derive real benefit from the national quotas allocated under the CFP. As announced in March, we are raising this issue in the IGC and, if needed, treaty changes will be sought. We have already secured the Commission's agreement that it will study with us the scope for taking practical and effective steps to regulate quota hopping within the existing framework of Community law.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para21"></a>The system of quota management is often criticised by fishermen. This is not surprising when quotas have to be set at low levels in response to falling fish stocks. The industry has been invited to make its own suggestions for improvements to the system we apply in the UK. At the annual review meeting in November the industry agreed that no significant changes should be made for 1996. However, the Government remain open to any constructive ideas which are likely to be acceptable to the industry as a whole.

<A NAME = "60418w01_para23"></a>Fisheries Conservation and Science
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para24"></a>UK fishermen have laid great emphasis on the importance they attach to effective technical conservation measures. This is absolutely right and, in order to address the problems of fisheries conservation, including discards and industrial fishing, we set up a Fisheries Conservation Group consisting of fishermen, scientists and other government experts to look at all the options for new technical measures to help conserve stocks. This will ensure that the UK industry has every opportunity to have the maximum influence on the new Community measures which, at our request, are to be agreed by the end of the year.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para25"></a>We need to increase our understanding of the impact of industrial fisheries on other stocks and on the wider marine eco-system. At the April Fisheries Council we shall therefore be calling for a collaborative research effort in this important area and pressing the European Commission to propose the introduction of a precautionary TAC (total allowable catch) for the large sandeel fishery.
 
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para26"></a>A further area which clearly needs serious attention by the fishing industry and fisheries scientists is the understanding of fisheries science and the use by the scientists of the best advice from commercial fishermen. We have set out on a number of occasions the importance of fisheries science in policy decisions, including in the speech of my right honourable friend, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at the University of East Anglia last November explaining the key role which science must play in policy making. We have now initiated a series of regular contacts between industry representatives and our scientists in order to increase fishermen's understanding of the work done by the scientists and to give the industry the opportunity to question the scientists and contribute their own expertise. This will be followed up by meetings between the industry and our scientists in advance of formulating our input into the international scientific advice on the state of the various stocks. We hope that these contacts will result in future in better informed decisions and a better understanding of how we reach decisions on fisheries management.

<FONT SIZE=3>in getting a clearer regional influence so that those most directly affected by decisions are heard more clearly. We have already put this idea to the Commission and the initial reaction was very encouraging. We shall be taking this up further at the April Fisheries Council, when we shall propose the introduction of regional consultative committees to bring together fishermen and officials from the member states active in a particular fishery to discuss issues relevant to that fishery. These committees would cover areas such as the North Sea and English Channel and could consider any issue of regional relevance, such as the most suitable technical conservation measures and the state of fish stocks.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para29"></a>On the longer term arrangements for the CFP, we are open to constructive suggestions from the UK industry in particular in relation to the 2002 review. On one important point--the 6 and 12-mile limits--we have already made it clear that they are not negotiable. The Commissioner has herself acknowledged the desirability of having a clear statement about the future and we shall be seeking to build on this.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para30"></a>Fish Marketing
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para31"></a>Turning to fish marketing we have encouraged the industry to respond constructively to changing needs, in particular by making better use of the system of producers' organisations. Producers' organisations have already evolved in response to changing conditions in the industry. In the light of those changes, and the recommendations of the recent Sea Fish Industry Authority Task Force Report, we are launching a consultation on the role and function of fish producers' organisations. We will also be seeking views on how various changes to EU legislation on recognition and supervision of producers' organisations should be implemented in the UK.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para32"></a>The importance of the fish market is also reflected in the agreement of Ministers to an increased levy rate for the Sea Fish Industry Authority which will provide funds for their promotional work and open the way for a significant contribution from EU aid.
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para33"></a>Conclusion
<P>

<A NAME = "60418w01_para34"></a>These are not easy times for the fishing industry. The Government recognise that it is facing a number of difficult issues both on the operation of the CFP and because of the decline in fish stocks. That is why we are taking initiatives across the whole range of fisheries policy in the way set out above.
