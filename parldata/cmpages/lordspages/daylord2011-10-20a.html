Since 7 March 2011, police forces and authorities have been free to decide, in consultation with their local communities, whether to continue monitoring these encounters. These local decisions will ensure the right balance between the necessary paperwork that allows for appropriate public accountability and irrelevant bureaucracy.</p>

As reported, the requirements for recording these incidents have changed and each police service will now decide whether or not to record stop and account activities. Is the Minister aware that this decision will damage race and community relations and do nothing for police accountability? Further, can the Minister tell the House how the Government will meet the requirements of the UN committee for accurate information when the figures are no longer uniformly collected?</p>

It is also necessary to emphasise that there are real potential savings of some 800,000 police hours in not having to record these matters. This should be a matter for each local force and community and that is why, as the noble Lord will be aware, the Met is still recording these after consultation with local communities and the local police authority, whereas other areas do not feel this is necessary. The savings made are very real, and it is a question of getting the balance right.</p>

They are the largest group of people stopped and searched, and only about one in 10 searches ever results in some sort of criminal justice process. What system of monitoring will be established to ensure that the law-abiding black community has confidence in the police?</p>

It is also vital that they must be used as sensitively as possible, as the noble Lord implies in his question. With regards to monitoring, it is vital to get this right. That is why I am very keen to stress the balance between accountability and bureaucracy, given the potential savings to the police in not having to record stop and account and in allowing them to carry on their activities properly without excessive bureaucracy. The police will still record stop and search, but recording stop and account is a matter for local decision-making, and that is why the Met, for example, will continue to record stop and account.</p>

Does the Minister have any figures to show the proportion of young black people stopped and searched compared to white people, and if he has not got the figures, will he look them up? I suggest the ratio is between 6:1 and 8:1.</p>

This Question is directly related to the fact that we will no longer make it compulsory to record stop and account, which I have explained. I do not have at my fingertips the figures that the noble Lord seeks, but I shall write to the noble Lord and make sure that he has them.</p>

The Minister says that this is about reducing bureaucracy, but does he not agree that this is another signal of the Government seeking to abdicate from responsibility for policing? Since the number of police officers is going down and crime is going up, it is easy to see why the Government want to abdicate their responsibilities.</p>

There is no need to record this activity, but we have left it open to local police forces to make the decision. There is a correct balance to be struck between accountability and bureaucracy. We do not want to overburden the police, as did the party opposite when it was in power, with excessive bureaucracy that prevents them doing the job that they are supposed to be doing.</p>

The Treasury works closely with colleagues in the Cabinet Office's Major Projects Authority to monitor the progress of major projects. The universal credit programme is on the Government's major projects portfolio, which is a compilation of the Government's high-risk and high-value projects. It covers approximately 200 major projects with a total value in excess of £300 billion. The Major Projects Authority has been engaged with the universal credit programme since 2010. As well as providing challenge through regular assurance reviews, it is involved at various levels of monitoring progress. The Major Projects Review Group, a body established by the previous Government in 2007, recently also considered progress with the universal credit programme.</p>

On top of that, to make the IT system for the new universal credit work it will require every single employer in the United Kingdom to tell the Inland Revenue every single month how much every single employee earns in salary and pays in tax. As most government IT projects in recent times have failed, why does the Minister think that this one will succeed?</p>

Twenty per cent of those who will come under the universal credit system are currently estimated to have access to computers. It is planned that 50 per cent should have access by 2013 and 80 per cent by 2017. I myself queried those figures when I was being briefed but I am told that of those currently claiming unemployment benefit, some 80 per cent have access to online facilities and of those claiming jobseeker's allowance, some 60 per cent have access. I did not ask what the gender breakdown was; I suspect the answer is that more men than women have it but I remind everyone that the Government's current digital champion, Martha Lane Fox, is working on this.</p>

It is an important reform but there is a very high risk attached to it in delivering the IT infrastructure, because not only do you have to deliver three separate IT projects-one within DWP and two within HMRC-but they then have to integrate. It is a very high-risk timeline. Will the Minister reassure us that the high value that the Treasury places on this does not mean that it is blind to the risk in the timescale and that, if it needs to slow it down in order to make it a success, it will do so?</p>

I should add, as I was also asked about the novelty of some of these IT programmes, that the DWP is working to integrate roughly 60 per cent of existing IT infrastructure, which will be transferred to this programme. It is not an entirely novel programme: only 40 per cent of its IT will be novel.</p>

As noble Lords are well aware, the integration of HMRC systems with those of the DWP is an important part of this programme. We are all conscious that previous programmes, particularly on tax credits, have run into a very considerable number of problems about both underpayment and overpayment, and about underclaiming. It is intended that one of the great benefits of the universal credit system will be that a much higher percentage of claimants will claim and receive their entitlements.</p>

Is there not, therefore, a need for research on higher value crops to be made known to farmers? Perhaps some of these could replace some imports.</p>

However, we need to be aware that it affects the number of viable herds in this country. That is one of the consequences of this investment in this area. However, the noble Lord is correct that giving farmers the knowledge to achieve these challenges is the most important thing.</p>

The Secretary of State Caroline Spelman signed up to the G20 communiqué on food security in Paris last June, which calls on countries to invest more in innovation in food science. On the one hand it appears that her department has plans to encourage more research and development, but at the same time she is cutting the overall research and development budget by 27 per cent. Why does Defra sign up to international commitments calling on action from other Governments which it has no intention of meeting in this country? Why is it saying one thing and doing another?</p>

We will need to double world food production by 2050. We shall be able to do that only with science as an ally. The thrust across government, and the whole thrust of the Taylor review, was about leveraging the Government's investment as a whole in this area. We will be spending £1 billion on R&amp;D in the Living with Environmental Change Partnership and £440 million on global food security.</p>

There is one very good reason for being consistent, because there is before Parliament a draft Bill that is being examined by a Joint Committee of this House.</p>

One is the power of Parliament to elect a monarch-a power that has never been withdrawn. Secondly, of course, there are the common law principles of hereditary succession. When the Prime Minister wrote, under the Statute of Westminster 1931, to Commonwealth countries, consulting them on changes in relation to succession to the throne, did he point out this fascinating constitutional conundrum?</p>

The noble Lord is of course entirely correct about the Statute of Westminster. As to the other parts of his research, perhaps I might have the opportunity of examining that outside the House.</p>

The Leader of the House said there was no urgency in the matter, yet if a member of the Royal Family, such as Prince William, were to have a child in the near future, the issue would be affected by this.

We accept that there is an opportunity here and, as the previous question demonstrated, any amendment to the line of succession involves consulting those member states of the Commonwealth in which the Queen is head of state under the Statute of Westminster. There would also need to be legislation. Next week, there is a meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government and in the margins of that we hope to make progress on this issue.</p>

It is built on the concept that a person awoken from sleep at 3 o'clock in the morning and fearing for his or her life will be able to exercise a judgment on using reasonable force in a moment of sheer panic, when lawyers in a cosy courtroom many months later have difficulty in ascertaining, with all the time in the world, what is "reasonable". To expect a householder at that moment to be awake and lucid enough and in complete command of his or her faculties, in my opinion, is wrong and unjust.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="11102033000067"></a>The CPS guidelines state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="11102033000409"></a>"Anyone can use reasonable force to protect themselves or others, or to carry out an arrest or to prevent crime. You are not expected to make fine judgments over the level of force you use in the heat of the moment".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000371"></a>This year the CPS in Manchester, in the north-west, decided not to prosecute three householders who killed burglars while struggling with them and fighting to protect their homes and family. That was the right decision, but it was taken a month after the householders had been arrested. People who thought that they were going to be murdered in their own homes and fought back should not then be put in fear of being prosecuted, and left hanging for such a long time.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="11102033000068"></a>We should not have to decide whether the force was reasonable, but assume as a starting point, in my judgment, that any force used by a householder against an intruder is legal and appropriate. The message must go out to the police and public that householders have an absolute right to protect themselves, their family and home from intruders and that intruders leave all their rights behind the moment they climb through the window.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="11102033000069"></a>If the concept of "reasonable" cannot be removed, we must have a completely different understanding of what "reasonable" is at three o'clock in the morning. Envisage the situation where a person, believing that he or she is safe and secure at home, wakes up to find an intruder in the room. It must be one of the most terrifying things imaginable. I suggest that their reactions in all cases will be instinctive. It will be Pavlovian. It will not be reasoned. It may be to lie quivering in terror, to scream the place down or to retaliate and attack. I suggest that one of those reactions will come automatically; not as a process of reasoned thought. The innocent householder who instinctively lashes out at the intruder will be judged on the amount of force he used and whether it was reasonable in the circumstances. That puts an unfair burden on the innocent householder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="11102033000070"></a>A few weeks ago, 140 service men and women received awards, among them 16 Military Crosses. When you read the citations you see that we still produce young men and women of mind-boggling selflessness and courage, but in all cases, what they did was illogical, irrational, and clearly not what a reasonable person would do if they thought about it. They did not think about it, they just reacted instantly, spontaneously, to save the lives of their comrades. That sheer selfless courage has been rightly recognised. Nor were they doing what they were trained to do. The infantry manual does not state that when you come under heavy machine-gun fire, you single-handedly charge the enemy, firing your weapon, lobbing every hand grenade you can get your hand on and take out the enemy position while receiving wounds in your legs and gut, but that is what those lads who won the Military Cross a few weeks ago did-instinctively, when surprised and taken by shock by the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="11102033000071"></a>I therefore suggest that a householder similarly suddenly confronted by a potentially life-threatening situation should be permitted to use all the force he is capable of to deal with that situation and should not be at risk of prosecution afterwards. I would also like assurances from my noble friend that a householder will have a complete defence even if he could have locked himself in a safe part of the building. The fact that one could theoretically retreat to a safe room must not be used as an excuse by the CPS to prosecute the householder who decides to stand and fight. I appeal to my noble friend to demand of the CPS that it comes to decisions in these matters much more speedily. Where there is a clear-cut case of genuine defence in one's home, the householder must be cleared with all possible speed. It is unjust to leave them waiting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="11102033000072"></a>The most fraught area is when to stop defending oneself and one's property, especially if one chases the intruders from the home. I say "property" because the defence of oneself and one's home should extend to the defence of one's property in one's home. On when to stop defending oneself, the CPS guidelines state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="11102033000410"></a>"The situation is different as you are no longer acting in self-defence and so the same degree of force may not be reasonable".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000372"></a>The trouble is that the CPS often does not follow its own guidelines. The scandalous treatment last year of Omari Roberts is a case in point. He was a young apprentice builder with a perfectly clean record who came to his mother's house for lunch and found it being ransacked by two teenage thugs. In the struggle which followed, one burglar was stabbed and died. Omari was charged with murder based on a pack of lies told by the other burglar, who survived, who claimed that Omari chased him down the street. However, on the day that the case came to trial, the CPS dropped the charges as its key witness had by now forgotten his original pack of lies and had invented a completely new set. The CPS dropped the case not because it realised that it was acting entirely contrary to its own guidelines, not because it realised that Omari acted lawfully, but because it thought that it just might not win and that a jury would be 12 times more sensible than it was.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="11102033000073"></a>The surviving burglar's original statement said that Omari chased him down the street, and this is the bit that the CPS used to bring a charge of murder against  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_385"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 385</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Omari. The CPS said that the time spent chasing the boy could have been used to summon the police. But hang on. The boy he allegedly chased and attacked lived. The boy Omari killed never left the house. So how can the chasing of the second boy result in a murder charge?</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="11102033000074"></a>The biggest problem with this case is that the CPS's entire argument revolved round a teenage burglar's testimony, a teenage burglar with an ASBO and a number of previous convictions. Why is a burglar's testimony given more consideration by the CPS than the victim's statement? So although the guidelines are okay as they stand, it is sometimes, and often, the wrong-headed, misguided prosecution by the CPS of people like Omari which does tremendous damage not just to this innocent victim, but it sends a signal that the law is on the side of the thug and the burglar. That is where the damage rests.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="11102033000075"></a>This idea that there is a fine cut-off point when there is a threat and force is permissible, and then the second the threat is over force is not permissible, is also wrong. For some householders who instinctively fight back that adrenaline rush may last 30 seconds, for some it may last two minutes, for others it may last 20 minutes. It will be different for everybody and reason just does not come into it. If a householder continues his retaliation on the intruder even after the threat is theoretically over, he should not be prosecuted provided it was all part of that same psyched-up adrenaline rush that gave him the courage to fight back in the first place. I suggest that that is entirely different from a scenario where the householder has calmed down and half an hour later or the next day he decides to get revenge and go and beat up the burglar. That is not acceptable.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="11102033000076"></a>Let me quote one very sensitive example. Six years ago a highly trained, armed police officer was told that a person was wired up with a bomb and that innocent civilians were at risk and he could use lethal force. Leaving aside the incompetence of the command and control procedures of that operation, I have every sympathy for the officer who had to execute that order. Time was critical. He had to act fast. If the bomb was detonated, dozens would die. That officer psyched himself up to neutralise the problem and when he pounced on Mr de Menezes, he shot him in the head and again and again and again and again and again and again. Rightly he was not charged with any offence or disciplined because there was recognition that at times of severe stress a person taking action, even a highly trained officer, will go on taking that action long after the threat may be over because there is no rational or reasoned cut-off point when one is acting under extreme stress. I believe that the law must recognise that householders should not be expected to make rational judgments about when they should stop defending themselves by attacking the intruder when they are caught up in what is an entirely irrational situation in the first place.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="11102033000077"></a>I turn now to the protection of one's home from theft. The time is long overdue when this should be made a criminal offence enforced by vigorous police action. Why is this most serious of thefts still a civil matter? If I steal the smallest item from a shop, it is a  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_386"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 386</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>crime. I might not be prosecuted and I may get a slap on the wrist but it is a crime. If I think the restaurant meal was appalling, why should my dispute with the chef not just be a civil matter? It is not; it is a crime if I make off without paying for it. But if I come home from holiday and find that my house has been stolen from me, the criminal law does not care. The police do not want to know and I will have to spend months in the civil court system trying to get my property back. The people illegally occupying my house, of course, will get legal aid because they have no assets or property except my house. I will not get legal aid since I own a home which I cannot occupy and it will be a wrecked mess when I do get it back. The most valuable physical possession one has, apart from one's health, is one's home and it must be a criminal offence for anyone to misappropriate it.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="11102033000078"></a>It should apply to council housing and business property, too. If a council is failing to rent property quickly enough, the solution is for the Government to penalise the council. Occupation by squatters inevitably delays the day when that home is available for someone to legitimately rent. Of course, the police must not go around looking for people to evict. They should act only on a complaint from a property owner or tenant. If a person goes to the police and says that their property has been taken over, and produces prima facie evidence of their ownership-their name on the electoral roll or on a council tax demand-the police must be under an obligation to take recovery action immediately. That means evicting and arresting the squatters that day, with no right of appeal or judicial review at that time to delay the process.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="11102033000079"></a>If the Government go down this route-I hope that they do-and make this a criminal offence, I hope that the message will be clearly understood by chief constables that the main remedy Parliament wants is the immediate return of property to the lawful owner. In order to safeguard against suggestions that an unscrupulous landlord would lie to the police to get them to evict a tenant he did not like, we could build in a safeguard procedure: for example, that everyone calling for police assistance should sign a declaration stating that they are the legal owner or occupier. The penalty for a wrongful claim could be a £10,000 fine and two years' imprisonment; or, for a landlord trying to get rid of a tenant, a £50,000 fine and five years' imprisonment. That would stop any abuse of the system and reassure the civil liberties lobby.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="11102033000080"></a>The law should apply also to all commercial property, where legitimate owners at the moment are losing millions to illegal squatting. However, if noble Lords think that this is a bridge too far today, let us change the law as soon as possible on domestic premises being squatted and review the situation after a year. If we find that there is no abuse of the system, I suggest that the Government should push on with extending the criminal law to commercial property. The principle is the same: illegal occupiers of commercial property are no more moral than those who steal domestic property.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="11102033000081"></a>In both these situations, I have described how we need to change the law not just to correct injustices but to send a clear signal that it is instantly on the side of the law-abiding, the innocent, the decent, the righteous  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_387"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 387</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and those who fight back. I mean instantly-not months later when the CPS drops the charges; not years later when the Court of Appeal reduces the sentence; and not months later when a civil court might give you your property back.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="11102033000082"></a>In this, as in many things, perception is everything. There are lawyers who will say, understandably, that the law of self-defence is reasonable when applied by an intelligent court; but that is not the perception in the minds of innocent householders. That perception can be radically changed by small changes in the law, and I look forward to my noble friend telling me that he will bring in some of those changes instantly, and others in due course.</p>

It was considered by the Law Commission in 2005, which stated in paragraph 4.19 of its report, headed "The threatened householder", that,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000436"></a>"there is a strongly held view among many members of the public that the law is wrongly balanced as between householders and intruders. We think that much of that public anxiety is based on a misunderstanding of the present state of the law, contributed to by incomplete understanding of certain notorious cases".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000373"></a>That is where we start in a consideration of this important question.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="11102033000084"></a>What is the law? I went back to the common law as enunciated by Blackstone in his <I>Commentaries on the Laws of England</I> in 1761. On self-defence, he stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="11102033000411"></a>"The defence of one's self, or the mutual and reciprocal defence of such as stand in the relations of husband and wife, parent and child, master and servant. In these cases, if the party himself, or any of these his relations, be forcibly attacked in his person or property, it is lawful for him to repel force by force; and the breach of the peace which happens, is chargeable upon him only who began the affray. For the law, in this case, respects the passions of the human mind; and, when external violence is offered to a man himself, or those to whom he bears a near connection, makes it lawful in him to do himself that immediate justice, to which he is prompted by nature, and which no prudential motives are strong enough to restrain. It considers that the future process of law is by no means an adequate remedy for injuries accompanied with force"-</p>

<p><a name="11102033000085"></a>that is the future process, the point made by the noble Lord a moment ago-</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000437"></a>"since it is impossible to say to what wanton lengths of rapine or cruelty outrages of this sort might be carried unless it were permitted a man immediately to oppose one violence with another. Self-defence therefore as it is justly called the primary law of nature, so it is not, neither can it be in fact, taken away by the law of society. In the English law particularly it is held an excuse for breaches of the peace, nay, even for homicide itself: but care must be taken that the resistance does not exceed the bounds of mere defence and prevention; for then the defender would himself become an aggressor".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000086"></a>That is almost the speech that the noble Lord has made this morning. It also happens to be the law of this country, dating back 250 years.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="11102033000087"></a>Of course, the matter has not been left there. It was considered again in 1879 under the chairmanship of Lord Blackburn. I will not weary your Lordships with a quote from that but it was to the same effect. Most recently, in the Court of Appeal in October last year,  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_388"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 388</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Justice Hughes set out the very long established law, which has two or sometimes three stages into any inquiry into self-defence. First:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="11102033000412"></a>"If there is a dispute about what happened to cause the defendant to use the violence that he did, and there usually is such a dispute, then the jury must decide it, attending of course to the onus and standard of proof".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000374"></a>Secondly:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="11102033000413"></a>"If the defendant claims that he thought that something was happening which the jury may find was not happening, then the second question which arises is what did the defendant genuinely believe was happening to cause him to use the violence that he did? That question does not arise in every case".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000375"></a>In other words, the court will look at the honest belief of the defendant as to what he thought was happening. Thirdly:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="11102033000414"></a>"Once it has thus been decided on what factual basis the defendant's actions are to be judged, either because they are the things that actually happened and he knew them or because he genuinely believed in them even if they did not occur, then the remaining and critical question for the jury is: was his response reasonable, or proportionate?".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000088"></a>That is a statement of the law made very recently.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="11102033000089"></a>Let me give your Lordships some examples from my own experience to indicate how the law has operated. I can go back to the 1970s, to a case where the defendant was a former military man in his 40s, who had retired from the Army-he was a warrant officer-to look after his sick father. In those days people wore their hair long-perhaps some of your Lordships wore your hair long in those days-but he of course had a short back and sides and he became a butt of the community. One day when he was looking after his father in the bedroom of a council house, a youth came up the path and threw a brick through the fanlight above the door, whereupon the defendant took a .22 rifle and from the bedroom window shot him through the head and killed him. The defence was defence of property-he was in no personal danger in the bedroom with his sick father. The jury considered all the circumstances, as the jury is bound to do, and acquitted him. He was not guilty of murder, he was not guilty of manslaughter; he walked free.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="11102033000090"></a>Another case I recall from the Midlands was when a person, again in his home, heard a noise outside and discovered that some drunken passing youths had turned his car upside down on the drive. He went outside and remonstrated with them. They started to shout and hurl abuse at him. He went back inside and picked up a knife. When he came out, the youths were picking fence staves up in order to attack him. They attacked him and he stabbed one of them with the knife. The jury heard all the circumstances. He was defending himself and his home. Again, the jury acquitted him. All together he was found not guilty of murder.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="11102033000091"></a>These cases are from my own experience but they are happening all the time. A third, more recent, case is from Trinidad. A police officer, surrounded by a crowd of youths at a music festival, felt that he was being attacked. It was his defence that one of the people attacking him had produced a knife. He produced his revolver and shot two people, one of whom he killed. In that case, a trained officer used a gun against someone whom he believed to have a knife in those  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_389"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>circumstances. Unhappily, his counsel in Trinidad decided not to run the defence of provocation but to rely entirely on self-defence. The jury convicted the police officer of murder. In the Privy Council, it was pointed out that certainly the crowd around him and shouting at him were provoking. The case went back to Trinidad and, on a retrial, he was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of provocation.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="11102033000092"></a>My point is that the facts can be completely different and the surrounding circumstances are completely different in every case. If, for example, a burglar is in the bedroom and my wife is on her own, and she uses excessive force by, let us say, shooting-not that she has a revolver, I have to say-and kills the person concerned, that is a very different situation than if I were there and in a position to deal with someone of a reasonable size in order to defend myself and my property in that way. The circumstances cannot be categorised in any particular way.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="11102033000093"></a>In 2005, there was an attempt to introduce a Bill-the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Household Protection) Bill-to amend the law. It was introduced by Mr Patrick Mercer, supported by Mr David Davis and various others, in the House of Commons. It wished to replace the term "reasonable force", whether the jury were considering the force used in defence was reasonable, with the term "grossly disproportionate". The Bill did not get very far and one only has to stop and think: a jury is considering a whole series of facts around  a killing; it considers that the defendant has  acted unreasonably, but has he acted "grossly disproportionately"? You can imagine a debate taking place in a jury room to decide on the difference between being unreasonable, acting beyond reason, and acting with gross disproportionality. That sort of debate should not be left to juries, which approach these matters in a completely common-sense way, having regard to all the facts and circumstances put before them. While I sympathise to a certain extent with those concerned with some cases that come before the courts which seem to be grossly unfair, the law covers the situation and has done so since 1761 and before that time.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="11102033000094"></a>What concerns me is the concept that the decision as to what was reasonable should be taken by the police-that a householder should never be arrested and questioned if he has killed someone who has been an intruder. That cannot be right. The death of a person is extremely important and, whatever he may or may not have done, it is right that he should be arrested and that he should be questioned. If he has genuinely been acting in fear and in self-defence, undoubtedly he will give his view and his account of what happened at that point, a circumstance which the jury will no doubt take into account.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="11102033000095"></a>A person who has killed somebody, whatever the circumstances, is liable to arrest and questioning and, if necessary, detention until the whole matter can be sorted out. It is right that the decision should not be taken by the police and not even by the Director of Public Prosecutions, to whom the file is sent. It is for 12 people drawn from all parts of the community who should have put before them on the evidence all the circumstances and who should decide, using their  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_390"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 390</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>common sense, which they undoubtedly have, whether that person was acting unreasonably when he killed the deceased.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="11102033000096"></a>The problem is that Parliament has sometimes, and certainly over the past 13 years, failed to recognise the absolute value of having people from the community decide issues like this and has tried in various ways to put boundaries around the thinking of a jury, which is entirely inappropriate. Self-defence, that firm principle embedded in our common law going back centuries, is a matter for the jury to determine. Do not let us ever get away from that.</p>

I am most grateful to my noble friends Lord Blencathra and-I can now call him my noble friend-Lord Thomas of Gresford, because it makes me feel as if I am some form of pacifist. I suffer from a temper which very seldom rises but, if anyone did come into my house and threaten me, being in the agricultural sector I naturally have a pickaxe handle and a very large knife for pruning the vines; I can throw it into a dart board and get a double top.

I am going to concentrate on intrusion-"an Englishman's home is his castle", or matters of that sort. I will refer to a Private Member's Bill that I got through the House some years ago. To begin with, I would like to take as my text the words of Patricia Hewitt when she was head of Liberty. She pointed out that people should not be allowed to go into a person's home without permission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="11102033000099"></a>When I was in the banking world we became very concerned about fraud. I was in the Midland Bank, which was the largest bank in the world-and the world's largest bureaucracy. It was the same size as the British Navy. We had a rule of duty of care to our customers-although I was on the merchant banking side and we called them clients. We had a duty of care to look after their money. We were therefore concerned when it became apparent that officials could go into people's homes without permission and without a court order and search and seize papers, including financial papers. I am not just speaking about the dreaded Revenue or the receiver of rates or the bee inspector.</p>

We did a lot of research and found out in those days that there were innumerable Acts of Parliament and secondary legislation that enabled people to invade someone's property without permission or without a court order. The answer was to turn to Parliament. I was a relatively young Peer-I came here in 1963-and in 1976 we started to ask the Government questions. Which department had what authority to do what, when and where? The answers did not come back. We asked again and again. Finally, many years later, I asked a Parliamentary Question about which

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="11102033000101"></a>As noble Lords know, in your Lordships' House a Question is deemed too expensive to answer if doing so would cost more than £800. However, into the breach came the noble Lord, Lord Bach. As he will remember well, on 9 December 2005 I asked him a Question about what powers Defra had to go on to land to search and seize. He wrote back an extremely nice letter, which said that the main source of information was very difficult to find but that there was a book in the Library called <I>The Law of </I><I>Entry, </I><I>Search and Seizure</I> by a professor from Lincoln University. What the noble Lord did not know was that I had arranged for that book to be placed in the Library; we told his officials that this was the answer that should be given.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="11102033000102"></a>Over several years I introduced a Bill to say that people should not be allowed to go into people's houses or search their property without permission or a court order. I got the support of the officials. The noble Lord, Lord West-I call him the noble and gallant Lord but <I>Hansard</I> strikes that out because "gallant" is not strictly correct-went slightly against the grain so we agreed to co-operate with his officials and formed a joint public-private sector Bill team. After a period of considerable research with the Home Office, which was very helpful, we found 1,200 powers of entry, which are now drawn up into the freedoms Bill.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="11102033000103"></a>At first, I managed to get my Bill half way through the House. It went through on the second attempt. It should have done a lot of work for the Government but, of course, the Government are never grateful in these areas of activity. Some of the stories that we heard were fascinating. Stuck in the back of my mind is who is allowed to do what, when and where. The important thing about the Bill was that it said that you cannot go into property or a house without permission or a court order. That was exactly what Patricia Hewitt had originally said in her paper in the 1970s. The question is: how do we proceed from here? I hope that the Government will be prepared to introduce these rules and regulations and make them clear to people.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="11102033000104"></a>There are other areas in this matter. What is reasonable force and what is intrusion? The noble Lord, Lord Bach, pointed out in his reply to me that you could use reasonable force to enter or search a property. To me, intrusion-if I may take the word from the title of my noble friend's debate-is the invasion of privacy, but it can be all sorts of things. It can be surveillance. Therefore, I added questions about television cameras. We got the answer that there were 42,000 CCTV cameras in the United Kingdom. I wanted to know whether it was an invasion of privacy if people had a private camera, maybe for security purposes, that could survey someone else's property. It was pointed out that a gentleman could be seen leaving a property where there was a lady to whom he was not married. In that case, could the pictures suitably be used if there were to be some form of divorce case or matters of that sort?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="11102033000105"></a>We all know that there are many such cameras. I asked the noble and learned Baroness who authorised the private cameras. She said that they must be registered with the Information Commissioner. Therefore, we asked the Information Commissioner a private question about how many privately-owned CCTV cameras there were. He said that there were none at that time. In replying to this debate, could the Minister tell us how many surveillance mechanisms there are? That is one form of intrusion.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="11102033000106"></a>Another form of intrusion takes me back to my youth. As a small boy I always went to welcome the postman and undo the catch on the gate, and on the gate was written, "No Hawkers or Circulars". To me, a circular which is shoved through one's letterbox is an invasion of privacy or is intrusive. Direct selling is similar. If you have an ex-directory telephone line to protect yourself, before you know it you will be receiving phone calls from call centres that dial one number after another. Or, if you wish to make a transfer of money from a bank account, before you know it someone will ring you and say, "Who are you? We wish to test you". The transfer might be for small amounts, and you say, "Why should I tell you who I am? Who are you?". You then find that the call centre is located in Calcutta-where I have been on many occasions-so you ask the young girl at the end of the line, "Could you please tell me the name of the club that plays rugby and cricket?". She replies, "Oh, the Ballygunge Cricket Club". You then ask, "What is the name of the Writers' Building, where the head man lives?", and then you ask for her name. You find that the name she gives is not her real name; it is Elspeth, or whatever. In order that girls should not be courted on the telephone, I suppose, they have odd names. To me, it is an intrusive matter when your financial details are raised and mentioned overseas. I am concerned about the term "intrusion."</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="11102033000107"></a>When one comes to other issues, people can become violent. We now have 120,000 Acts of Parliament, published and available on the net. We need, perhaps with various local advice bodies, to provide some advice for people as to who they can stop coming into their houses. When certain clever fraudsters pretend they are from a particular ministry or department, people may open the door. Once the foot is in the door and where a woman is on her own, the quick ransacking of odd equipment, often televisions, is possible. I have a certain anxiety about this and would like to know what the Government plan to do with the freedoms Bill. All this brings with it other international things under EU law.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="11102033000108"></a>In our peasant farm in France where we were for the fin de vendanges two weeks ago we experienced a real invasion of privacy. It was very frightening and extraordinarily aggressive, but at two o'clock in the morning, with two shots, it was put down. It was a 136-kilogram wild boar. That is twice the weight of my noble friend who introduced this debate. So in some rural areas it is apparent that people may often defend themselves against certain predators with weapons. To me, an intruder is also a predator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="11102033000109"></a>In my deliverance today I am saying that it would be extremely helpful if citizens knew who could enter their property without either permission or a court order. That

My noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford has given me tremendous comfort, because I shall have no problem at all putting my defence weapons on the wall rather than under the bed. Sometimes the weapon was deemed to be a baseball bat, because that was considered not be an aggressive weapon. Having played baseball, I know that it can be. I sit down with great gratitude to my noble friend Lord Blencathra for what he has done today. I had not realised it was going to be such an aggressive Motion; I was on the peaceful side of wanting to know who could enter one's home, when, where and how.</p>

He was much admired as a Member of another place for many years and is likewise already much admired in this House; not least, his speech is good evidence as to why. He spoke with great passion and clarity. I look forward very much to the Minister's reply and will listen carefully to see what he will reveal about the Government's intentions in this area. Those intentions have been, if I may say so, skilfully kept under wraps since the speech of his right honourable and learned friend the Lord Chancellor at the Second Reading of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill last June in another place. So we look forward to hearing what the Government propose when the Bill is considered on Report in another place in the next few days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="11102033000111"></a>I want to thank the other noble Lords who have spoken in the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, gave us a masterly overview of the state of the law as it has been and still is today, and the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, reminded us of the hard work he has done in order to gain information about entry into property. Both noble Lords are among the finest storytellers in the House. We enjoyed the stories of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, about his earlier cases, and the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, as always, about his experiences.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="11102033000112"></a>Our position as the Opposition remains very much what our position was in government, and I shall refer, if I may, to an Oral Question in this House on 25 February 2010. I was sitting in exactly the position that the Minister is sitting in today and I was asked by my noble friend Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate whether we planned to change the law following recent cases. We said then that we,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000438"></a>"strongly support the rights of members of the public to defend themselves, others and their property with reasonable force. Under the law as it stands, a person is entitled to use reasonable force in self-defence to protect another person or property, to prevent crime or to assist in the lawful arrest of a criminal. The Government-</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000376"></a>the Labour Government-</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000439"></a>"have no plans to change the law on self-defence. The law is already in the right place and is working well".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/2/10; col. 1086.]</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000377"></a>We stand by that position because the law in the field of self-defence does work. As the Minister's noble friend, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, said in the same exchange:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="11102033000415"></a>"Does he agree that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the good sense of the jury is a real protection for individuals in these cases?-[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/2/10; col. 1087.]</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_394"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 394</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="11102033000378"></a>Of course the answer to that is: yes, it is. I would argue that prosecutorial discretion is widely and sensibly used in these cases. In our view, the CPS guidelines referred to by the noble Lord who introduced the debate are clear, straightforward and, following the phrase used by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, full of common sense.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="11102033000113"></a>According to the excellent House of Commons note that has been produced on this issue entitled, <I>Householders and the Law of Self-defence</I>:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="11102033000416"></a>"An informal trawl by the CPS suggested that between 1990 and 2005 there were only 11 prosecutions of people who had used force against intruders into houses, commercial premises or private land. Only seven of those ... resulted from domestic burglaries".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000379"></a>It is not claimed that that is the exact figure, but that is what the trawl found, and indeed I suspect that the figure is actually a bit larger because I do not think it includes a case in which I appeared for the defence, which I promise noble Lords I am not going to tell them about now-I saw the Minister worrying about that. But I do not think it is included because it was not a homicide case-it concerned causing grievous bodily harm. Surely this proves how seriously the Crown Prosecution has taken its responsibility over the years in not prosecuting when it would be wrong to do so. There is a second safeguard-the double lock that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, pressed on us-that the juries who hear these cases use their common sense, which is at the very heart of the reasonableness test, and invariably get their decisions right in these cases.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="11102033000114"></a>There is a very strong consensus-and noble Lords will have their own opinion whether it is a right consensus or a wrong one-that all those concerned with the administration of justice, be they judges, advocates, barristers or solicitors, or those who study these matters in detail, believe in essence that the law as it stands works and should not be tampered with. The Judicial Studies Board document of March 2010 sets out the law in order to assist judges in self-defence cases, both generally and in burglar-type cases in particular.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="11102033000115"></a>What are the Government going to do to change the present position? Are they going to do anything? The House will know that the Conservative Party manifesto of 2010 included a pledge,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000440"></a>"to give householders greater protection if they have to defend themselves against intruders in their homes."</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000380"></a>This seemed to fit in and imply that a grossly disproportionate test would replace the reasonableness test. The right honourable Chris Grayling, when he was shadow Home Secretary, said in December 2009:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="11102033000417"></a>"At the moment the law allows a defendant to use 'reasonable force' to protect him or herself, their family or their property. Conservatives argue that the defence that the law offers a householder should be much clearer and that prosecutions and convictions should only happen in cases where courts judge the actions involved to be 'grossly disproportionate'".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000381"></a>In December of that year, the present Prime Minister made an equivalent comment. Is that what the Government intend to introduce in the LASPO Bill? I invite the Minister to tell the House today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="11102033000116"></a>In the Oral Question that I referred to earlier, the noble Lord, Lord Lester, then speaking from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, said that,</p>

<ul><a name="11102033000443"></a>"that if the Official Opposition were in government and sort to change the law in the way suggested, they would run up squarely against the European Convention on Human Rights and would find themselves in grave danger of violating the rights of the individual?".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/2/10; col. 1087.]</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000384"></a>Does the Minister agree with that statement?</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="11102033000117"></a>I remind the House of some of the comments that have been made in regard to the "grossly disproportionate" test. Peter Mendelle QC, who was chair of the Criminal Bar Association in January 2010, argued that those who proposed that test should:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="11102033000418"></a>"Leave it alone and stop playing politics with the law ... This is not law and order. This is no law-and disorder".</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="11102033000118"></a>Quite tellingly, Michael Wolkind QC, who represented the defence in the both the Martin and the Munir Hussain case-I think that he did so in the Martin case at appeal only-gave telling expression to why "grossly disproportionate" is the wrong test. He said that permitting householders to use any force which was not grossly disproportionate would amount to "state-sponsored revenge". He said that there was no need for the law to be changed. He went on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="11102033000419"></a>"The law already recognises that people react in a certain way in the heat of the moment ... If I manage to tackle a criminal and get him to the ground, I kick him once and that's reasonable, I kick him twice and that's understandable, three times, forgivable; four times, debatable; five times, disproportionate; six times, it's very disproportionate; seven times, extremely disproportionate - in comes the Tory test"-</p>

<p><a name="11102033000385"></a>he was talking in early 2010. He continued-</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="11102033000420"></a>"Eight times, and it's grossly disproportionate. It is a horrible test. It sounds like state-sponsored revenge. I don't understand why sentencing should take place in the home. Why can't it go through the courts? Why can't the jury, as they always do, decide what is reasonable?"</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="11102033000119"></a>We on this side think that the "grossly disproportionate" test is the wrong test. Can the Minister tell us whether the Government intend to bring in such a test and, if they do not, what they intend to change in the existing law, which we argue works very well?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="11102033000122"></a>I am not a lawyer, so, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, or the noble Lord, Lord Bach, I cannot unfortunately call on experience from various cases. My only experience is that I once chased a burglar down the street in my pyjamas in my bare feet. I was 21 at the time but I could not catch him even then, so I cannot tell what I would have done if I had caught up with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="11102033000125"></a>However, I understand the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Blencathra. Someone breaking into your own home is a terrifying experience. A noble Baroness in this House-I will not name her because I did not get her permission-told me about a burglary and what a trauma it was for her. Interestingly enough, the healing for her came when the burglar was arrested later and she was asked whether she would like to meet him. Her reason for telling me the story was to advocate the benefits of restorative justice. She said that whereas what she had confronted in her flat was a terrifying situation and someone she was very frightened of, when she met a rather pathetic drug addict who had broken in in the hope of getting something to feed his drug addiction the terror somehow drained away. Her story was a little bit of anecdotal evidence of restorative justice in action and benefiting the victim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="11102033000126"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bach, asked about the Human Rights Act and the ECHR. As he well knows, any proposals that we would have to make-</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="11102033000129"></a>There is no intention to sweep away the reasonable force test, but we think that there is a case for clarification. The current law on self-defence was last reviewed, as the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said, during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. That Act clarified the operation of these defences. The court must consider whether the degree of force used by the defendant acting in defence of themselves or others, or to prevent crime, was reasonable in the circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="11102033000130"></a>I know that the Opposition trawl back into past speeches by various individuals-they are entitled to do that; I have done it myself-but the coalition agreement states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="11102033000421"></a>"We will give people greater legal protection to prevent crime and apprehend criminals. We will ensure that people have the protection ... they need when they defend themselves against intruders".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000131"></a>It is on that basis that we have started this process, as the previous Government did in 2008. As my noble friend Lord Thomas pointed out, this is a piece of law that has developed over 250 years. He went back to quoting Blackstone, and it is amazing listening to Blackstone just how contemporary it is in the issues that it addresses.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="11102033000132"></a>There is one thing that worries me about "reasonable and proportionate" and about the vigour of my noble friend's approach. My noble friend Lord Thomas referred to a man who shot a trespasser and even the pacific noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, extolled the virtues of a shotgun-in that case it was for a 136-kilo boar-but there is a worry that we have to get the balance right on this. We do not want a vigilante society or one where people, in the pursuit of protection, start thinking that the gun in the bedside table is the best protection that they could get. It just so happened that my copy of <I>New Scientist</I> fell through the door as I was about to leave this morning. I had better come clean; it does not come for me but for my two sons, who are regular readers. However, I was looking at it today and my eyes fell on an article which shows that in the United States around 20,000 children are injured by firearms each year; a further 900 incidents are fatal; and some 30 million American children live in homes where there is at least one firearm. I know that the United States has very much more of a gun culture but I worry that unless we get the messages clear on this, we could slip towards the idea that firearms are a legitimate way of protecting your home. That is certainly not the way that we want to go.</p>

It is probably worth a PhD being done somewhere to find what other uses there are for them. One of the things that came through in the contributions is that the facts are different in every case. Like my noble friend Lord Thomas, I put great faith and trust in a jury and a judge who hear all the facts and can balance the arguments. Again, we must therefore not retreat too far from those principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="11102033000134"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, produced an interesting speech, as he always does. The early theme of it was, "I am a pacifist but I will knock the block off anyone who says that I'm not", but he also got on to the issue of an Englishman's home being his castle and where we have got to on things such as search and seize powers. He pointed out that the Protection of Freedoms Bill, which will be coming before this House, will address some of the issues that he has been campaigning on, including the scale of coverage by CCTV cameras. There is always an interesting kind of clash with CCTV; anybody who has been canvassing on the

We will be having opportunities to discuss those matters. On the delivery of leaflets, I have had debates on the doorstep with householders who believe that I am intruding by pushing through their letterbox a Liberal Democrat leaflet, whereas I have argued that I am exercising my right in a participating democracy. To date, none of those exchanges has ended in violence on either side.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="11102033000135"></a>I share some of the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, about intrusive telephone calling and the way in which these bodies now seem to be able to ring through for sales purposes. You can get them blocked but the noble Lord identifies a very real problem. There was also his concern about officialdom calling. One can say time and time again never let anybody into your house unless you are absolutely sure who they are and sure about the validity of the person calling. Yet I know from reading my local newspaper that the elderly are particularly vulnerable to calls from bogus officials, who use that opportunity to commit crime. So some of the issues raised by the noble Lord about intrusion and related matters are very pertinent.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="11102033000136"></a>I should like to respond to the challenge from the mover, the noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, and to the noble Lord, Lord Bach, by stating exactly where we as the Government are. The two main issues that were raised were self-defence and squatting. I can assure noble Lords that both issues are high on the Government's priority list. They form part of a range of policies to fight crime and to give people greater confidence that the law will protect them when they go about their business in a reasonable and law-abiding way. I will outline the Government's plans for clarifying and, where necessary, strengthening the law in both areas in the order that the noble Lord raised them.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="11102033000137"></a>First, let us be clear that there are a number of simple precautions that homeowners can take to reduce the risk of burglary such as installing alarms, planting prickly shrubs or other things along the perimeter fence, not leaving valuable items on display and leaving lights on when the property is empty at night. But even if every precaution is taken, there will be instances where an intruder is not deterred from breaking into somebody's home. As I have said, it can be a very frightening prospect indeed to be confronted by an intruder in your own home. The Government believe that the law should be as clear as possible about what a homeowner can do to defend themselves, other people or property.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="11102033000138"></a>As noble Lords have heard, the current law on self-defence allows a person to use reasonable force to protect him or herself or other people, and to prevent crime. The current law makes clear that a person in this situation may use all force that is reasonable in the circumstances as he or she perceived them to be at the time. That last bit is important: the law rightly recognises-my noble friend emphasised this-that a person acting in the heat of the moment cannot be expected to weigh to a nicety precisely what level of force was required in the circumstances. Having said that, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, that the public may still be doubtful about what  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_399"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 399</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>"reasonable force" means in practice and that further clarification in this area would be beneficial.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="11102033000139"></a>Noble Lords may recall that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced recently that he wanted to put beyond doubt that homeowners and small shopkeepers who use reasonable force to defend themselves or their properties will have the law on their side. We have been working on new legislative measures to achieve that and are still finalising the details of the policy. The provisions will be designed to give people greater certainty about what it means to use reasonable force in self-defence. We are not planning to sweep away the principle altogether, or to give householders the right to use all the force that they are capable of mustering, which appears in some ways to be what the noble Lord is suggesting. Giving householders carte blanche to do whatever they like to an intruder would be a very dangerous strategy. A press release by the CPS in January 2005 provides some examples of where householders have and have not been prosecuted. In one extreme case, a defendant caught an intruder, tied him up, beat him up, threw him into a pit and set fire to him. I do not think that anybody would agree that that sort of behaviour should be condoned, even if the defendant was extremely frightened. If we abolish the concept of reasonable force and say that householders can do whatever they want to an intruder, we could effectively end up sanctioning this type of conduct, or other forms of vigilantism.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="11102033000140"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, referred to recent cases in Manchester where homeowners had been arrested for killing intruders, only for the CPS to decide to take no action. In my view, these cases show that the law is broadly in the right place and that the majority of homeowners who act honestly and instinctively in self-defence will not be prosecuted, but I accept the noble Lord's point that defendants in these cases may be on tenterhooks following such an intrusion and I think it is important that in these cases the CPS tries to act with some speed. I will draw his remarks to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who I am sure is aware of the need to be as expeditious as possible in deciding whether or not a charge should be brought, but I do not think it is right to say that householders should never be arrested for killing an intruder.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="11102033000141"></a>The police have a difficult job when they are called to an address where someone is dead. They have to work out what has happened and an arrest may well be necessary in order to allow for a prompt and thorough investigation of the case. The Government are working with ACPO on new guidance for the police in order to ensure that consideration is given to whether somebody may have been acting in self-defence, but there will always be cases that are not clear-cut, where it is important that the police investigate the allegation. I saw an example in an earlier briefing in which the apparent cause of death was an attempted burglary, but further police investigation showed that there were gang and drug aspects to the case that made the death not necessarily a result purely of self-defence. One has to realise that there are cases that are not as clear-cut as some of the Manchester examples that the noble Lord drew attention to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="11102033000142"></a>Let me turn now to the points that the noble Lord raised about squatting. The Government share his concern about the harm that squatters cause. Residential and non-residential property owners have contacted Ministers and Members of Parliament time and again about the appalling impact that squatting can have on their homes and businesses. It is not only the cost and length of time it takes to evict squatters that irks property owners; it is also the cost of cleaning and repair bills which follow eviction. While the property owner is literally left picking up the pieces, the squatters have gone on their way, possibly to squat in somebody else's property. Again, the noble Lord gave some very good examples of where even the smallest, most trivial of crimes bring down the full weight of the law, yet people can find themselves being told to take the civil law when their property has been squatted.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="11102033000143"></a>The current law already provides a degree of protection for both commercial and residential property owners, as offences such as criminal damage and burglary would apply. There is also an offence under Section 7 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 that applies where a trespasser fails to leave residential premises on being required to do so by, or on behalf of, a "displaced residential occupier" or a "protected intending occupier". This offence means that people who have effectively been made homeless as a result of occupation of their properties by squatters can call the police to report an offence. However, there are many residential property owners, including landlords, local authorities and second home owners, who cannot be classified as "displaced residential occupiers" or "protected intending occupiers". Given the level of public concern about the issue, the Government decided to consult publicly on options for dealing with it. There is a consultation paper out which sets out a range of legislative options. The consultation process ended on 5 October and generated more than 2,200 responses, which officials at the Ministry of Justice are now analysing.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="11102033000144"></a>While most property owners would evidently support tougher measures to tackle squatting, a number of bodies such as Shelter and other charities have pointed out that people would not squat if they had somewhere else to go. Of course, one of the Government's priorities is to try to address the shortage of affordable housing. The Government are taking both sides of the argument into account as they develop proposals in the area. I cannot pre-empt the Government's formal response to the consultation, but I hope that we will be able to announce our plans in more detail very soon. As I said, this has been a relatively short debate-although I have been told that I have over-run my time-but I hope that I have met a number of the points. I have certainly found it extremely useful, not least to have had a useful prod from both my noble friends.</p>

I am grateful to my noble friend the Minister for his statement of what the Government intend to do, I look forward with interest to the proposals on squatting and I urge on him my halfway-house solution: let us tackle the problem of domestic premises being taken over first. If the Government's changes to the law there work, then one can look at commercial premises afterwards.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="11102033000148"></a>On self-defence, yes, I was trying to push my noble friend further than I know the House wants to go, or the Government want to go. I have no real objection to the concept of reasonable force, if the CPS guidelines are followed. Like the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and other noble Lords, I am entirely supportive of the jury system; we must keep that. I am merely suggesting that there are some cases I have read about where the CPS should not have taken someone to the jury stage, but should have exercised the judgment to drop the case-Omari is a case in point. I also note the point that the noble Lord, Lord Bach, made that, in a trawl, there were only about 11 cases, maybe slightly more, which the CPS did advance.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="11102033000149"></a>I conclude by saying that I hope my noble friend will urge the CPS to make a rapid decision in such circumstances. Those of us who are addicted to "CSI: Miami" are used to Horatio confronting a highly complex, horrific crime scene, with 20 different suspects, reaching clarity within 24 hours and deciding who the bad guy is and who is innocent. I rather want the CPS to do the same in all these cases. I thank all noble Lords who have participated in the debate and look forward to hearing the Government's proposals in due course. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.</p>

I have believed for some time that some vital improvements are overdue in the teaching of, and the importance placed on, history in the United Kingdom. The knowledge afforded to us from learning history forces us to think about who we are; to consider our national identity and responsibilities; to decide whether we live in isolation and selfishness and therefore choose to be passive or whether we go forth and make a difference to the world around us-to learn, to be aware and to be considerate of others' beliefs and traditions and to ensure that previous mistakes are not repeated.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="11102033000152"></a>There is a common saying that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. It is obvious that we must learn from our past, but to do so we must know our past. Through learning about remarkable individuals and how they shaped our historical  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_402"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 402</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>landscapes over time, it becomes clear that we all have our roles to play, as did they. Our children are our future, as we were to our forefathers, and history is the key to their future. It is imperative that history be taught, and taught properly. The history that we know does not belong to us; we merely help to contribute to it and protect it for the next generation. It is our duty to ensure that we pass on this knowledge so that our children can, we hope, benefit from it by learning from mistakes which have occurred in the past and, ultimately, by improving the world in which they live-and so the cycle continues.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="11102033000153"></a>If taught well, history introduces all kinds of transferable and highly valuable skills, such as an appreciation of the significance of cause and effect and the ability to understand and analyse complex arrangements. Learning about past human relations, and about human nature itself, enhances one's social awareness and, of course, our sense of national identity. In addition, good general historical knowledge produces a good grounding and jolly good common sense, which is perhaps the most important skill of all.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="11102033000154"></a>Knowledge of this subject is seen by many as a valuable currency. For example, the Russell group of universities openly admits that those who possess history qualifications have always been, and still are, immensely attractive candidates when deciding who to take on at degree level. That is why it worries me that the same importance is often not placed on the teaching of history at the earlier stages of the schooling process. England is now the only European country that does not require that history be taught to the age of 15 or 16, and growing numbers of pupils are being allowed to drop the subject at 13. Ofsted reported that 102 maintained secondary schools entered no students to sit GCSE history in 2010. Some 30 per cent of pupils in state schools took history at GCSE last year, and only 20 per cent in academies, compared with 50 per cent in the independent sector. I am afraid that this is affecting the most disadvantaged young people in our society-the very ones for whom a good, well-rounded education is one of their only hopes of improving the quality of their lives.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="11102033000155"></a>There are concerns that some young people are being steered into more restrictive pathways, and that these are the most likely to be eligible for free school meals and to live in areas of greater social deprivation. What is being done to target these young people specifically, to ensure that they get the help and encouragement they need? Of all the pupils entered for GCSE history in 2010, roughly 67 per cent passed with grades A to C. Of all those who took GCSE history and were eligible for free school meals, 46 per cent achieved grades A to C. Similar trends can be seen at A-level, and this has a knock-on effect for universities. According to the schools White Paper, of the approximately 600,000 children who enter state education every year, some 80,000 are eligible for free school meals. Only 45 of those students made it to Oxbridge. That figure is up by 12.5 per cent on the year before, when only 40 made it. That increase is welcome, and I commend the Department for Education for it, but the figure is still very low. I would be interested to know what proportion of children eligible for free school meals made it to any university.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="11102033000156"></a>I have always believed that our primary goal in politics is to make opportunities equally available for all and to narrow the gap between rich and poor-the advantaged and the disadvantaged. As Michael Gove said recently:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="11102033000422"></a>"It is only through reforming education that we can allow every child the chance to take their full and equal share in citizenship, shaping their own destiny, and becoming masters of their own fate".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000386"></a>I completely agree. Everybody deserves this equal opportunity. Sadly, it seems that it is the most disadvantaged children who are missing out. We must not continue to fail them. Put simply, if one does not know enough, one is at serious risk of not achieving one's full potential. We must ensure that all our children, particularly the most disadvantaged, fulfil their potential. I know that the Government are acutely aware of this issue and are committed to correcting it. Can the Minister update the House on the progress of the plans in this respect?</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="11102033000157"></a>Last month the Historical Association published a report in which it noted that the only access to specialist history teaching for two-thirds of young people is during key stage 3. From then on specialist expertise fast disappears in many schools. We in the UK are lucky to have so many fantastic teachers, but what is being done to entice more talent into the profession and to ensure that history teachers are always properly trained and possess the expertise and enthusiasm that is necessary to do the subject real justice? I mention enthusiasm specifically because that is the reason why I studied history when I was lucky enough to go to university. I was taught by some extremely able and enthusiastic teachers.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="11102033000158"></a>In their report, the Ofsted inspectors cited that a particular problem with the teaching of history was an unbalanced curriculum that paid too much attention to particular topics at the expense of others. Some of our children are missing out on learning about some of the most important individuals and events of our heritage. The Prime Minister once remarked that the composition of the history curriculum was tapas-like, whereby children are given bite-sized and disconnected instruction on isolated events, and no narrative. I have to say that I agree. I am astounded when I read stories about one set of children thinking that Winston Churchill is the nodding dog character in the television adverts for insurance. I read only the other day that our colleague, the noble Lord, Lord West, was spotted on the Central line wearing his full military attire. When an eight year-old asked him why he was dressed in that way, the noble Lord replied, "Because I am in the Navy". The boy then asked him, "What is the Navy?". This is incredibly alarming and surely must not continue.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="11102033000159"></a>What is being done to ensure that the history curriculum is properly composed in a chronological manner so that children can place what they learn in a logical way in their minds? Can the Minister also tell us what is being done to make the subject more accessible to children and more exciting to study?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="11102033000160"></a>The only thing that we have learnt from history is that we never learn from history. That is a very bleak forecast, but it has been promulgated on many occasions. I just hope that it does not always happen. I dearly

What all school children learn,Those to whom evil is doneDo evil in return".
<p><a name="11102033000387"></a>It is a legendary phrase that he wrote in his poem on 1 September 1939. The phrase "all school children learn" was one that he could use then and everyone accepted it. That is no longer the case. All schoolchildren do not learn. A consensus has gone.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="11102033000163"></a>The consensus has gone because over the recent generation there have been what you could call curriculum wars. They arose because a generation of postmodern writers analysed history and came to the conclusion that it was merely entirely subjective and a narrative that was the propaganda of one particular segment, and that being subjective no-one could decide whose history to teach. Those wars went on in academic circles to the detriment of young people. You could imagine that, for example, over the teaching of the history of Ireland. Do we teach the Catholic or the Protestant version? Whose version? One person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Whose version do we teach? The chaos of these arguments over the teaching of what truth is-when can you call a fact a fact and not propaganda?-created a crisis in the teaching of history itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="11102033000164"></a>Bernard Williams, a philosopher, in his book <I>Truth and Truthfulness</I>, drew on what has been an ongoing debate since the time of the Greeks-the postmodernists did not invent it, although they aggravated it. Bernard Williams quoted Clemenceau who, when asked what future historians would say about the First World War, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="11102033000424"></a>"They will not say that Belgium invaded Germany".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000388"></a>We can also be confident that Archbishop Ussher, the Primate of All Ireland, was wrong to claim in the 17th century that the world began on 23 October 4004 BC-that that was the day of creation. He believed it, he spoke it as truth, and he was wrong. Knowledge changes over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="11102033000165"></a>We know that the victors write the history. We have in this building a painting that demonstrates that Wellington defeated Napoleon and that the British were the victors at Waterloo. The Prussians beg to disagree; but the overriding fact was that Napoleon was defeated. These curriculum wars have brought us to this sad state of affairs and it is important that we reinstate history for the three benefits that I shall name. I am sure that noble Lords will mention many

History teaches us the timeline of humanity. It teaches us chronology and what it means for the human race. I was asked by a small child, who was not that small and should have known better, "Did the Tudors come after the Victorians?". They need to know. There is virtue in knowing about the Normans, the Plantagenets, the Tudors and the Stuarts because in that way children can understand the nature of monarchy in this country today. That is very important, enriching and a pleasure to know.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="11102033000166"></a>Secondly, history teaches cause and effect, as the noble Lord, Lord Luke, said. Have we ever resolved what the causes of the French Revolution were? Have we always gone on writing essays about them? How fruitful it is to revisit such a subject-the causes of the Industrial Revolution or the Russian Revolution? Revolution figures quite a lot in these causation debates. Only this morning, Andreas Whittam-Smith, writing in the <I>Independent</I>, asks, "Is the world heading for a new revolution?". In his article, he cites the circumstances of 1848 when, as noble Lords will know, Europe was swept by revolution. He cites the causes of the 1848 revolution and suggests that they are available today, and that we should think about that. Understanding cause and effect will make us think about our present society.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="11102033000167"></a>History teaches judgment. Over the years, history has taught us to judge the slave trade. It has taught us to judge Victorian society-its virtues as well as child labour and squalid industrial circumstances. It has taught us to celebrate the emancipation of women. Recently, the Tricycle Theatre in London put on a series of 12 short plays in groups of four, running over three nights. Called "The Great Game", it is about British involvement in Afghanistan since 1940. It sold out. Sir David Richard, the Chief of the Defence Staff, said that it was as historically accurate as you would get in any lesson. The audience was full of people from the Ministry of Defence, soldiers, civil servants, Sandhurst cadets, and people who wanted to know the history of British involvement in Afghanistan. The British were not the only ones. The plays then went to Washington and were played at the Pentagon.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="11102033000168"></a>There is a greed for history. There is a greed to know how we got here. How did this situation arise? It is directly significant in all our lives today. There is a yearning for history in people's hearts. People may miss out at school, but when the new archive building opened at Kew, it was inundated with people seeking their genealogy-those who wanted to know about their ancestry and to feed their identity.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="11102033000169"></a>The television programme "Who Do You Think You Are?" has a big following. It teaches people how to go to church not for the religion necessarily but to seek out records of births, marriages and deaths and of their families. History is also expressed in the civic pride we find when cities are full of plaques on the walls, indicating to us where important people lived and what they contributed. With my background, I am particularly fond of one on a rather posh Manchester hotel that records Peterloo and what that massacre stood for in the movement towards democratic reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="11102033000170"></a>History gives us our identity and a perspective. It allows us to understand the issues of the past about which we might feel some guilt-a wish to apologise even-but it teaches us who we are. It gives us local, civic pride and national pride. We must not deprive our children of that.</p>

<a name="11102033000171"></a><b><a name="111020-0001.htm_spnew80"></a><a name="11102033000589"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Luke on calling for this important debate. When thinking about it, three things occurred to me: my grandson's pet hen, the Secretary of State for Education's speech to the Conservative Party conference in 2010 and the EBacc. Let me explain. Recently my grandson got a pet chicken. When he was asked what he wanted to call it, he said, "Boudicca". We were all a little taken aback because we thought he was going to say "Henrietta", or "Hyacinth" or something like that.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="11102033000172"></a>It made me ask him some questions about what he was learning in his history lessons at school and he knew as much as most of us know about that mysterious and warlike queen. Then I looked in some detail at the national curriculum document for key stage 1 for 5 to 7 year-olds. It states that during key stage 1,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000444"></a>"pupils learn about people's lives and lifestyles. They find out about significant men, women, children and events from the recent and more distant past, including those from both Britain and the wider world. They listen and respond to stories and use sources of information to help them ask and answer questions and learn how the past is different from the present".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000389"></a>It goes on to indicate that they are expected to acquire a chronological understanding of events and objects, develop an understanding of events, people and changes in the past, find out about the past from different sources, select from that knowledge and communicate it in a variety of ways.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="11102033000425"></a>That struck me as quite challenging and interesting and absolutely fine for a young child. Then I read what the Secretary of State for Education, Mr Michael Gove, said in his speech to the Conservative Party conference in 2010, which was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="11102033000426"></a>"Children are growing up ignorant of one of the most inspiring stories I know-the history of our United Kingdom ... The current approach we have to history denies children the opportunity to hear our island story. Children are given a mix of topics at primary, a cursory run through Henry VIII and Hitler at secondary and many give up the subject at 14, without knowing how the vivid episodes of our past become a connected narrative".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000390"></a>If that really were the state of affairs, it would be extremely sad. However, I had difficulty in connecting the two things: the curriculum that I had read and my right honourable friend's speech. Even for such young children, the curriculum talks about the history of Britain and chronological understanding. It also seems to me to have a balance between acquiring knowledge and skills. So I looked further to see what Mr Gove's problem was and I discovered that all children have to study history up to the age of 14-that is, during their first nine years of schooling.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="11102033000173"></a>Perhaps there is a problem with the curriculum for older children. I found that at key stage 2, 7 to 11 year-olds do more of everything that is in key stage 1 and they also learn about changes and continuity in their own area. They are expected to look at history in a number of ways, such as political, economic, technological and scientific, social, religious, cultural  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_407"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 407</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and aesthetic. Again they have to use different methods and sources to investigate and use dates and historical vocabulary to describe events, and learn that the past can be interpreted in different ways. They have to do three British history studies and studies in European and world history. Even those latter ones incorporate looking at Britain in a European or world context.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="11102033000174"></a>I was still puzzled about where the problem was. I then looked at key stage 3 for 11 to 14 year-olds. They study people and events in Britain from the Middle Ages to the 20th century, build on chronological understanding and are expected to develop further awareness of cultural, ethnic and religious diversity, changes across different historical periods, causes and consequences-the noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, said that was important-the significance of historical events and assess the validity of different historians' interpretations. They are being asked to develop critical thinking. It occurred to me that this should really help to develop their critical skills and we do, of course, want to develop critical thinkers in this country.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="11102033000175"></a>When I was at school, history was a very passive subject for me and I was bored stiff. I repeated the Middle Ages for three years running, but still know far too little about it. It was better in primary school where we were able to do some project work which was much more engaging. So, looking at what the curriculum requires, it is hard to know what the problem is. Yes, I accept that the number studying history at GCSE and A-level are going down, but all children have already had nine years of history and that should be enough for many of them if it is well taught.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="11102033000176"></a>I will return to that. However, I do not believe that interest in history ends when you leave school. As the noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, said, you have only to look at the popularity of history programmes on the television and the enormous membership figures of the National Trust and the National Trust for Scotland. History, personal in relation to family trees and national, has become one of the major activities for older people. Programmes such as "ou Think You Are?"ch I am a keen fan, and the many heritage programmes on television, have very high viewing figures and schools television programmes are also excellent. This started decades ago with the famous "Civilisation" series.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="11102033000177"></a>However, I listened recently to a Radio 4 programme about the teaching of history and they did a lot of vox pops. Here I heard a clue to the problem identified by the Secretary of State. Those contributors who enjoyed history and really learnt something had specialist teachers who were passionate about their subject and communicated that to their pupils. Here I think we have a problem. The Historical Association-as the noble Lord, Lord Luke, said-conducted a survey of history teachers this year and they, and Ofsted too, concluded that there is much to celebrate. They said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="11102033000427"></a>"This is not a narrow curriculum, as the Secretary of State suggested, confined to Henry VIII and Hitler"</p>

<p><a name="11102033000391"></a>That is not my opinion, but that of the expert historians. Having looked at the curriculum, I am afraid I agree with them. However, we should also take note of something else they found: that 67 per cent of the teachers surveyed did not have a history adviser in their area; 49 per cent said they had little or no  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_408"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 408</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>training for subject leadership; and 90 per cent said there was an absence of subject-specific continuous professional development. As the noble Lord, Lord Luke, pointed out, two-thirds of young people get access to a specialist teacher only when they get to secondary school and sometimes not even then.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="11102033000392"></a>That makes history advisers and CPD really important if we are going to have confident teachers who can communicate a passion for the subject. Only then are we going to get enough young people taking GCSE and going on to A-level and history degrees. Only then will we produce enough history graduates to provide more specialist history teachers, as well as enough people to fill all the other posts that require professional historians.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="11102033000178"></a>History is important. It helps to develop in young people many of the same skills and critical attitudes and understanding of methodology as science does. If you want to know why history is important, you need look only at what happens to someone who completely loses their personal history by losing their memory. They are adrift. They lose the ability to understand themselves through the prism of their own past. Nations are the same. They understand themselves and are better equipped to face their future if they know about and understand their past.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="11102033000179"></a>What are the Government doing about this? That brings me to my third point: the EBacc. I understand from the statement to me of the Minister for Schools, Mr Nick Gibb, that the reason for the EBacc is,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000445"></a>"to ensure that more children study history".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000393"></a>I presume he means that more 14 to 16 year-olds study history, as all five to 14 year-olds do so anyway. The Government have been at pains to say that the EBacc is only one of many ways in which schools will be judged and that they want only to ensure that all children have the opportunity to study history at GCSE level. That may well be, but the best way to ensure that young people study hard, make an effort and come out of school with some confidence-building success behind them is to ensure that they can study those subjects which are most appropriate for them. It is also a fact that not all schools see it that way. They think that they will be judged on the EBacc, and we find that they are staffing up to deliver it at the expense of other subjects such as RE, music and vocational subjects. That is a problem.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="11102033000180"></a>I certainly do not agree with Simon Schama's conclusion that we are creating two nations of young Britons: those who grow up with a sense of our shared memory and those who have been encouraged to treat it as little more than an ornamental polishing for the elite. Having read his article in the <I>London Review of Books</I> of March this year, I am much more inclined to agree with Richard Evans, who says about the national curriculum:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="11102033000428"></a>"There seems to be plenty of factual content in all this, plenty of kings and queens too. The examples the curriculum provides for teaching history to children from 7 to 11 make mention of 36 significant individuals, ranging from Boudicea and Caractacus to Livingstone and Brunel. From 11 to 14, children study the whole sweep of British history from 1066 to 1900".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000394"></a>He points out that assessment concentrates 70 per cent on knowledge and 30 per cent on skills, so why Mr Gove thinks that facts and names play no part in all this is a  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_409"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 409</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mystery. Richard Evans concludes, and I agree, that the problem is not in the curriculum but in schools' ability to deliver it. Therefore my question to my noble friend is: what do the Government plan to do about that? Are the new teacher training schools to be involved? What sort of specialist support will be available to non-specialist teachers, who will inevitably have to deliver history, in particular in primary schools?</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="11102033000181"></a>Finally, I express the hope that those carrying out the curriculum review will not feel the need to throw the current curriculum up in the air as a kneejerk reaction to one or two critical and opinionated historians but instead to seek the views of a wide and balanced range of them. The only lesson of history may be that we do not learn the lessons of history, but we should try.</p>

Therefore, what the Etonians had to study was something about which I had thought a good deal. Although I am not a teacher of history, I have taught in universities; although I am not a schoolboy, I have an interest in the debate.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="11102033000183"></a>The aim should be to give to everyone who goes to school in this country a broad knowledge of the history of the country. I do not think that foreign countries are as important in the teaching of history as is the teaching of history in Britain. That teaching should concentrate on five things: first, the growth of political liberty; secondly, the industrial revolution; thirdly, the expansion of Britain overseas to the Empire; fourthly, some feeling of the importance of English literature and art throughout the ages, which is one of the reasons why we are admired outside this country; and, fifthly, some view of our relations with the continent of Europe, which has been such a continuous part of our political and intellectual development from the Middle Ages onwards-and, indeed, before. Do not forget that, had things gone differently at Orléans in 1430, this country would have achieved that union with France which Winston Churchill wanted to achieve in 1940.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="11102033000184"></a>Speaking of those five separate undertakings, I believe that the winning of political liberty in this country is something on which we should dwell. It was not as easy as it must seem. Some of those who challenge it now seem to think that it is not worth talking about. The effort to achieve habeas corpus, constant elections and the rule of law was not an easy undertaking. It took many generations to perfect it. It would be good if in most schools students-pupils-were brought up to understand the golden age of British politics. One might say that that was the 1790s, the age of Pitt, Charles James Fox, Burke, Sheridan and so on; unless one thinks that it would be better to concentrate on the 19th century, the age of Disraeli and Gladstone or of Gladstone and Salisbury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="11102033000185"></a>The history of the industrial revolution should also be discussed. The industrial revolution is sometimes vilified as if it has brought ugliness, unhappiness and misery. That is not the case. It has vastly increased

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="11102033000186"></a>The Empire, the expansion of Britain, should also be discussed. There are several sections to that: the North American empire, the African empire, the Middle East empire, the empire in the Far East, concentrated on the Malay States and Singapore, and Australasia. Those are five separate undertakings by which we as a nation are judged. I belong to a family which served continuously in both India and Africa. I am aware that one can criticise my ancestors or my uncles, but I know that they thought that they were doing the right thing not only for this country but for the peoples of the countries concerned, to whom they were bringing culture, Christianity and civilisation-three major "C"s which they never forgot.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="11102033000187"></a>The fourth British achievement-in the arts-should also not be forgotten. We are admired as the nation of Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, Shelley, Dickens and Scott just as much as we are as the nation of Pitt, Fox, and so on. There is no question but that such writers as Sir Walter Scott and Dickens are still in the mind of all educated Europeans- indeed, of all citizens of the world.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="11102033000188"></a>Finally, there is the relation with Europe. This is a permanently quarrelsome topic but the fact is that British history has been continuously a part of Europe. We have always been in Europe. The mere fact that our main square is called Trafalgar Square and our main station is called Waterloo is a reminder of that. Our monarchs have been alternately French and German, as well as Welsh and Scottish, but our relation with Europe characterises all our military activity throughout recorded history.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="11102033000189"></a>I think these five sections should play a part in national education in a major way and the subject should be approached as if they were the essential underpinnings of the historical memory which we are trying to stimulate, develop and achieve.</p>

He referred very modestly to his work on the Spanish civil war but no more seminal work has been produced in this country in the past 50 years.

Over the nearly 42 years now that I have been associated with this place I have on many occasions taken parties of school children round this building, which I love and will love to my dying day. I have always taken them to the Royal Gallery and I have gone through the kings and queens whose portraits hang there from the first of the Hanoverians onwards. I have talked of the two great paintings by Daniel Maclise, which are being looked at for restoration. There is a great difference between the parties that I

The noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, referred to the phrase that every schoolboy knows. In the early 1970s when I talked about the Battle of Trafalgar and the Battle of Waterloo-the pictures of which, incidentally, had to be covered up when Giscard d'Estaing addressed both Houses here-every member of the group that I was showing round would know about Waterloo and Trafalgar. In more recent years that has not been the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="11102033000192"></a>As a young man before I entered the House of Commons I was for 10 years a schoolmaster. I taught history. I had charge of the history curriculum in two schools. I made sure that the boys-I am afraid they were all boys in those days in the schools in which I taught-when they reached the age of 16 all had a reasonable, chronological knowledge of the history of their country. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, is right to say that it is the history of our country that we should be primarily concerned with. I made sure that all those boys knew about the great events in English history and the great people who had moulded those events, be it Wycliffe and the Lollards and the first attempt at an English Bible, Hampden and Pym in the 17th century, those great orators of the 18th century to whom the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, referred, or Gladstone and Disraeli. One liked to try and enliven one's lessons by telling amusing stories. I always loved the one about Disraeli and Gladstone when Disraeli said that if Mr Gladstone fell into the Thames it would be a great misfortune but if somebody pulled him out it would be a calamity. By means of anecdotes one could bring alive the history of the country in a way to which young people responded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="11102033000193"></a>In more recent years when I have shown people round there has often been a look of blank incredulity and ignorance when I have talked of some of the great names of our past. Why is that the case? I am afraid I do not share the sanguine view of the history curriculum held by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. What may be said in the curriculum papers is not necessarily brought forth in the classroom. I think that Mr Gove was entirely justified in making the remarks that he made in 2010 and I hope that my noble friend, when he comes to respond to this debate, will be able to give your Lordships some encouragement. The knowledge of our history is the birthright of every child in this country. To deprive a child of his or her birthright is an act of wanton intellectual and academic vandalism. It is essential that all our children have a knowledge of our history so that when they leave school they can fit into the framework of national events the things about which they read in the contemporary press.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="11102033000194"></a>We were recalled to this House in August to discuss those dreadful, disfiguring riots. There was unanimous consternation here at what had happened. I put forward a suggestion, which I want to repeat. I said that every young man or woman leaving school, be it at the age of 16 or 18, should go through the same sort of ceremony that those who now aspire to British citizenship must go through and that in order to do so they must be able to demonstrate a certain knowledge of the history of their country. We have a golden opportunity coming up to do something about this.</p>

Is he talking about teaching history, as he and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, have described it, or should we not have more about the people's history of Britain? There is another dimension to history teaching on which a number of very commendable books have been written which turn the world upside down. Would he reflect on that as well?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="11102033000197"></a>The point I am seeking to make is that I believe that those who leave school to go into the wider world should be proud of their British birthright, which means that they must have a knowledge of the history of this country. I was going on to say that I believe there is a golden opportunity coming up because in 2015 we will be commemorating the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta. Only yesterday I was talking in my capacity as chairman of the History of Parliament Trust to Sir Robert Worcester who is chairing the committee on Magna Carta. I asked him whether it would not be a marvellous idea if in that year every school leaver in the country was given a facsimile of Magna Carta and an account of what it meant for the foundation of our liberties. That would be a good thing and would help concentrate the mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="11102033000198"></a>Anniversaries are good. This morning at Question Time-rather mischievously, because it was not relevant to the Question-the noble Lord, Lord West, talked about Trafalgar Day, which is tomorrow. How many people out there know that Trafalgar Day is tomorrow? Should it not be incumbent on those who teach history in our schools to ensure that every child knows that Trafalgar Day is tomorrow, just as they should know the significance of 11 November? Of course, in three years' time we will have an opportunity to reflect on the beginning of the First World War.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="11102033000199"></a>The problem today is that there is a pick and mix attitude to history teaching in schools. Very often there is a constant emphasis on the Second World War. I was born just before the beginning of that terrible war and of course I yield to no one in acknowledging how tremendously important and life-changing for everyone around the world it was. However, that is not the sum total of history. The noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, talked about cause and effect, as did my noble friend Lord Luke. If people are going to understand the Second World War, they have to understand the First World War; and if they are going to understand the First World War, they have to understand the French revolution, to which the noble Baroness referred. If they are going to understand that, they have to understand our revolutions of the 17th century: the bloody one, which resulted in the death of the king, and the glorious one, as we often call it, through which the true foundations of parliamentary democracy were laid and the absolute power of the monarch came to an end without bloodshed. All these things they have to know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="11102033000200"></a>It is important that we should discuss these matters in the House. This evening I will have the honour of presiding at a small dinner for a group of fellow members of the Royal Historical Society. We shall meet David Willetts, the Minister in charge of universities, to discuss the teaching of history in universities. This is a follow-up to a similar dinner that I arranged last year for Royal Society members to meet Michael Gove to discuss the teaching of history in schools. A golden thread links the two: we want more young people in our schools to read history at university. We hope that when they do, it will give them a comprehensive knowledge of history such as is not always the case at the moment. I have a son of whom I am extremely proud. He read history at a great university. He knows nothing at all about the Middle Ages, although he has a very good degree. That cannot be right.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="11102033000201"></a>We have an opportunity today to point to and underline the fundamental importance of the study of our past. My noble friend introduced the debate very eloquently on that score. We also have a duty to ask the Minister to do all that he can with the Secretary of State to ensure that the centrality of history in the curriculum of our schools is underlined. History must be chronological and as all-embracing as possible. Young people must study it to the age of 16 at least, and when they leave school they should not only have knowledge, but knowledge of which they are truly proud.</p>

It is a pleasure to take part and to follow the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, who has done so much in his career to promote history and heritage. I declare an interest as chair of English Heritage and also, in another life, as a makeshift historian. Sadly, I was never taught either by my charismatic noble friend Lord Morgan or by any of the other historians in the Chamber-sadly, not even by the noble Lord, Lord Cormack.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="11102033000203"></a>The debate is extremely timely because it is timeless. At its heart are questions that surround the whole purpose of teaching history and how we find the right way to teach it. Dictatorships have never had a problem with the importance and purpose of teaching history, and they have come up with similar solutions. Democracies, too, wrestle with this, and many questions raised in the House are fundamental to a democratic appreciation of the importance of history. Even in a country such as ours, with a very placid trajectory, we have wrestled with these questions for decades if not centuries.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="11102033000204"></a>The teaching of a subject that raises the issue of what constitutes the national past and what should be taught in schools is a study in history itself. It is a brave debate to embark on, and it is a brave Minister who, in summing up, will have to try to reconcile all the different views. I have been helped to find my own way through this thicket by the work of David Cannadine. I was very happy that he gave me access to a book he is about to publish called "The Teaching of History". I am very grateful to him for the brief glimpse he gave me of a very powerful thesis in which he charts the

There is no doubt that, in a very decentralised curriculum that serves an astonishing variety of schools and a diverse system generally, the teaching of history has been fraught with disagreements, at least since 1870 if not earlier-I am sure my noble friend could correct me.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="11102033000205"></a>Until the 1980s and the coming of the national curriculum, the power to influence through the Secretary of State was very limited. Now, with the national curriculum and its relationships with examinations, almost as many issues are being raised. Many of them were raised in this debate, with controversies around them. The fundamental question is whether history matters. If it does not, it is hard to explain the fascination demonstrated already across the Chamber, for example with "The Tudors" on television or with the great blockbusting historical novels or, indeed, the great popularity of anniversaries. If one wants an example of how government interferes with the presentation of history, the account of Prince Albert chairing the Fine Arts Commission, and the commissioning of the Maclise portraits in the new German technology, on which he insisted, is fascinating. I commend Malcolm Hay, our curator, for that knowledge.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="11102033000206"></a>If history does not matter, why is there so much evident concern with the fact that fewer than one-third of students take history beyond 14? Why is there anxiety among teachers themselves about the lack of specialist knowledge in primary schools? Why is there an agonised debate about narrative versus bore-hole theories of history? I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that many of these issues will be raised in the curriculum review. History does matter, and must be seen to matter. That is crucial. In a complex, liberal and individualistic society such as ours, consciousness of the past is even more important. The more sophisticated that our society becomes and the more that we move away from linear, simplistic interpretations, the more we need history. Of course it is about identity and it is central to our sense of place, significance, perspective and proportion. I was fascinated by the account of the dramatic interpretations of British relations with Iraq. For the past 10 years I have yearned for our Governments to know more about the history of British relations with the Middle East in general.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="11102033000207"></a>History offers at least two particular, related motivations for learning. One is that it is full of ripping yarns and feeds our appetite for more stories. One of my GCSE heroes was Jethro Tull and the seed drill, although I cannot imagine that he is a very popular figure these days. The Elizabethan spymasters, too, captured my imagination. Having talked to a few leading historians this week, including some from the better history forum, which involves both academics and teachers, it seems that a key issue is time itself-time in the school day. Evidence suggests that since 2007 the curriculum has been eaten away in terms of time and focus. Head teachers are under pressure to get results. One result is that in many schools the time available for history is heavily restricted. In some, the discipline survives as a discrete subject; in others, it is treated principally as serving other disciplines. The picture is very patchy, especially in primary schools.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="11102033000208"></a>In secondary schools there is a growing tendency to cram key stage 3 into two years. This can mean that, in effect, many pupils get only two years of specialist history teaching before they give the subject up. The rest of Europe might be shocked to know that we have students giving up history completely at 13. I have to ask the Minister why he thinks so many schools are losing the battle. How can we incentivise head teachers? What impact is the EBacc going to have in this respect? Crucially, does he agree with the case made by many historians these days that history should be compulsory to 16? Does he agree that this would drive a more coherent and integrated syllabus across key stages 3 and 4?</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="11102033000209"></a>This is a salient question because, no matter how we read history, whether we are on the side of the great sweeping narrative or we see the virtues of the in-detail study of Henry VIII or Hitler, there is a tension here. We do not go in for the great historical panorama set pieces any more. I do not want to use another food analogy, but it has been described as the YO! Sushi approach to history, where one just tastes little bits of history and studies short blocks of time intensively. Whether or not this approach allows a better understanding of historical debates and engagement with original materials-and I think possibly it does-it certainly leaves students, as Ofsted put it, with,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000446"></a>"an episodic knowledge of history"</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000395"></a>and a sense of time that is unclear. At GCSE level there is a sort of swerve back into narrative history but the complaint here is the isolated use of texts without the connecting tissue of context.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="11102033000210"></a>The question of what is taught, and how, raises questions around the need for transparency of the assessment and examination system. Again, I hope the curriculum review might address this. I do not want to put the Minister on the spot but there is a big question about whether the Government should have a greater role in determining detailed content of the curriculum to avoid, for example, eccentric programmes of study. Another subset of this tension between narrative and episodic teaching is between what could be parodied as the Gradgrind approach to history-"Facts, my boy!"-and the approach that determines that history is a splendid way of developing other analytical skills and competences. Again, this is an active debate in our schools today.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="11102033000211"></a>I too have read the Historical Association reports about the absence of specialist teaching and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, was quite right to point to that as absolutely central to how we read and develop this debate into better learning and teaching. By the sound of it, it is possible that some students can go through their entire school career without ever being taught by specialist teachers. Ofsted talks about teachers failing to establish,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000447"></a>"a clear mental map of the past",</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000212"></a>because they lack expertise and because of the disconnected way the national curriculum treats topics.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="11102033000213"></a>Finally, one point of particular relevance to bodies such as English Heritage is the proposition from the better history forum that the Government should work from the outset with professional bodies and resource providers to ensure that the curriculum is fully resourced.  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_416"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 416</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I say amen to that, because surely history is above all an adventure-an active and participative adventure. When children are engaged with learning they are motivated to learn more, and when they visit our great monuments and sites, whether in school or sometimes more successfully out of school, they do not engage with bricks and mortar but they engage with their imaginations.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="11102033000214"></a>There is a problem with time and resources in schools-it is a crowded curriculum. I hope the Minister agrees that time and resources are well spent when schools commit to out-of-school learning. English Heritage is fully engaged with this, as noble Lords will understand. We have wonderful resources that we download into classrooms and then we upload students into our sites and monuments. Anyone who has seen the legions of 10 year-old Roman soldiers at Birdoswald on Hadrian's wall-making Roman lamps no less-or encountered a group of tiny children acting out the life of the Victorian servant class in Apsley House, will know that these children will always want more history and that heritage for them is not actually the past, it is something that enriches and explains their future.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="11102033000215"></a>One of my ambitions is to make those occasional encounters a substantial and systematic part of the relationship between local schools and local history and the national story. We have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, that he would like to see his five themes; I would actually like to see more attention in the curriculum to the local history of our country and, of course, the four countries in our nation. I would also make a plea for more study of the impact of science and technology.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="11102033000216"></a>For noble Lords who have not been there, I should say that Dover Castle is a brilliant example of how history reinvents itself. Dover Castle was not only an Iron Age hill fort at the beginning of our story; it concludes with the wartime tunnels-opening this summer-from which Admiral Ramsay, a rather neglected figure, saved the soldiers from Dunkirk, when 300,000 men were taken off the beaches. We have the whole story of England in one site. How much better can it get?</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="11102033000217"></a>Finally, I do not entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. I actually share Simon Schama's concerns that if less history is taught in some schools-those schools might be the academy schools, and I would like the Minister to comment on whether that is possibly the case-there can be a schizophrenia, which is to say a sense of shared memory and shared appreciation of history among one group of people and a lack of interest and appreciation among another. That has huge implications, not just for culture but for a diverse nation which has to come to terms with a number of different stories and histories. I believe that this is an issue. As Simon Schama said,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000448"></a>"a truly capacious British history ...will not be the feeder of identity politics but its dissolvent".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000218"></a>That is one of the many very serious questions raised by this debate.</p>

It was when we were getting rid of the old O-level and replacing it with GCSE, and it was decided that this was not fact-driven enough. We had to do something else; we just could not have this new syllabus with things like empathy coming in. When I criticised the council leader who sacked a teacher who was, bizarrely, teaching to the then Scottish O-grade, I was attacked about it over the phone. I was quite joyful as a 26 year-old to tell a 45 year-old councillor to go and shove it and read the debate before he spoke to me again. Everybody has an opinion, everybody gets paranoid about history, because everybody assumes that the bit they are interested in is the bit we should be interested in-the bit that we find speaks to us should be the bit that somebody else should take on board.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="11102033000220"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cormack, spoke about the 18th and 19th centuries. I did the 18th and 19th centuries because I was at school in the 1970s. I did the O-level system where you actually learned lots of facts-we had O-level memory and we did not have any history, to be perfectly honest. Yes, we could run off all the Prime Ministers and the Acts they passed, but it did not tell you anything. It did not tell you how they related to each other or how anything went on from that. The noble Lord referred to the Glorious Revolution, so called because of course in England there was not any fighting; it was all in Ireland and Scotland-not quite so glorious there, possibly. Every time you take a little bit of history you have to look at it.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="11102033000221"></a>Probably the most profound historical exercise I undertook was to do with being best man at a wedding in France, believe it or not. I was best man to a university flatmate who also read history. The families were arguing over who should sit where. Over the second bottle of wine at a dinner party it was suggested that I might want to put all the French people on tables named after famous English victories over them, with the most embarrassing paragraph about that victory on the table, and the English the other way round. This was an extremely fun project. The best one I found was Yorktown for the English. You could say it was a French victory-and we had a few Americans there so they got annoyed as well; it was great-because the army of America was of course paid for by the French and there were nearly as many French soldiers outside and a French fleet besieging it, which is an interesting little fact to take back and annoy people with. You then get the idea: "But that's not really fair. No, that's not it". But that is what happened. Unless you look at and embrace your failures and the things that went wrong in history, you will ultimately get it wrong. In looking at history, we tend to look at what makes us great. We should look at what made us bad as well and remember the fact that any nation which has been out there could almost drown in its own sins of failure or perhaps straightforward misunderstanding at any point.</p>

I suggest that India might argue with us that it had a valid culture and a valid history. Its civilised and recorded history is rather better than

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="11102033000223"></a>This comes down to the question of how one takes this information and puts it into a classroom. My noble friend Lady Walmsley got it right when she read out what is prescribed in the history curriculum. It is a huge task, which, if anything, is too big. It is possible only with specialist support. Perhaps we are too ambitious and ask everyone to do rather more than they are capable of. A limit on what you are trying to do might be important. How can we possibly bring this together?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="11102033000224"></a>We come back to the fashions in history. People of my age were taught about the 18th and 19th centuries. Now it seems to be World War II and the Tudors-possibly not, but they seem to be the fashionable subjects that come up most often. What is more valid? One could spend a lifetime discussing that question and still not come to a conclusion that means anything. As has been pointed out, they are part of the same continuous street.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="11102033000225"></a>I have met professional historians-indeed, the much missed Lord Russell, who I remember would say when you got slightly outside his spectrum, "Oh, not my period". He might have had a rough idea of what was going on but it was not his period. Most professional historians are like that. The arguments about fashion come back to the idea of the marxist versus the revisionist or the post-modernists. All of them basically play with ideas. Then we all have an opinion on the ideas. We have all done a little history or have all done some education, in that most of us have been to school. The idea of fashion comes in and out and always different pressures will be put on people as regards fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="11102033000226"></a>We should not read too much into this. The one thing that we can be sure about is that fashion changes. People now attacking the system and the status quo will be attacked because that is what academics and politicians do. They feed off ideas. If history gives us an idea of place and of our place within our country, it will depend on how we teach that and how we connect it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="11102033000227"></a>I shudder to say this with my noble friend Lady Benjamin at my left elbow: the fact is that if you come from an ethnic minority you may have a different sense of what is important in history from, for example, a white hereditary Peer. I am sure that different family connections go back through the system here. I know that my family provided people for the colonial service for quite a long time. There were different perceptions of what you did and what you should not do. Once again, people can drown in a sort of self-loathing for things that were done in days gone by which they would never do today. That is fashion or perception.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="11102033000228"></a>I say to my noble friend who will answer this debate that when we talk about history, we should try to remember that there is not a right answer. There are merely answers that will give some help and understanding. Is it a narrative guide to what happened in the past or is it an academic discipline? On using history to discover other things, I had a moment from my nine year-old daughter, who asked, "What is rape?". I said, "Why do  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_419"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 419</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>you want to know?". She said, "Boudicca's daughters were raped by the Romans". That was a slightly less worrying reason for being asked that question than many I can think of.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="11102033000229"></a>Once you use history for various parts of education, you will always have to make sacrifices. The sacrifice that you will ultimately have to make if you teach more history is whether we should teach more English and maths. We all know that English and maths is appalling and has never been as good as it was-as it always was in my youth and, indeed, my mother's youth, apparently.</p>

<a name="111020-0001.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="11102033000230"></a>English is a very difficult language to learn because of its two origins-French and German, thanks to the fact that the English were ruled over by French kings for several hundred years-which is probably one of the reasons. Perhaps history can help us with that. There is always a problem somewhere in the curriculum. Ever since we have had a national curriculum, there has been a constant cry to spend more time on the pet subject of the person speaking at the time. Recently, we have heard about nutrition, parenting, English is always coming up and now history. We must make a limit on this. History must be fit in as a coherent part of that whole. We will never get it right. A degree of flexibility may be important in the approach but if we say that there is one right way and one wrong way, all we will do is set up another row, which, after all, may be what the professional historians want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="11102033000232"></a>However, at the age of 18 I would have been a disappointment to many in your Lordships' House. I had no overall timeline of British history. I would have struggled to give the correct century for the Battle of Waterloo; I had not covered a world war; and I just thought that it was quite curious that some borders in Africa happened to be straight lines. I know that I am not alone in that experience, as friends of mine spent a new year holiday watching the boxed set of Simon Schama's TV series "A History of Britain" back to back.</p>

I have watched as politicians and commentators have flailed around with concepts like multiculturalism and trying to redefine Britishness. Obviously the teaching of history in schools is not a silver bullet and I am not for one minute suggesting that we make teachers responsible for national identity. But I have become convinced that inspired teaching of  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_420"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 420</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>our national story is an essential element in forming our national identity, which includes the English story and the multicultural story.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="11102033000234"></a>I say the "English story" deliberately. As a wise friend of mine said, people identify as British Asians, not English Asians. The teaching of the English story in schools is essential to the British identity and it has been, until recently, the missing part. Why is that? It should be simple-start perhaps with King Alfred and tell the narrative. But many of the English still do not know how to, or some say are not willing to, deal with parts of the national story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="11102033000235"></a>In 2007, I was involved in organising an event to commemorate the bicentennial of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act. Again, politicians and commentators seemed unsure about how to handle the anniversary. Is it a celebration? Is it a commemoration? Do we apologise? This lack of national peace over contentious events does little to assist our history teachers who have to teach this without making white children feel bad and black children feel angry. It is not an easy task. As if the Empire and the transatlantic slave trade were not difficult enough, in the post-9/11 American response, President George W Bush saw fit to use the word "crusade". I think many of the English wanted to go and hide. But national peace with our history will not come if children are not even taught the basic content of it. Analysis of events you do not even know about is of course impossible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="11102033000236"></a>Simon Schama, the Government's adviser on the national curriculum, puts it like this:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="11102033000429"></a>"Without this renewed sense of our common story-one full of contention not self-congratulation-we will be a poorer and weaker Britain".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000237"></a>I believe we have been poorer and weaker as a people who do not know their own story and identity are more vulnerable to malevolent influences such as the EDL and the BNP.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="11102033000238"></a>In some senses Britain has always been multicultural as we are made up of four nations. Over the last 60 years, however, Britain has sought to include millions of people who often have a different heritage, culture and tradition. Without a strong English story being taught and known, who knows what these newer communities were expected to integrate with? However, the change in the British population means that the teaching of the nation's history in schools is a more varied and perhaps a more challenging task. We all need to know why Britain is the way it is.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="11102033000239"></a>I remember one sunny afternoon at Hampton Court Palace when I happened to notice that virtually all the visitors were white. This caused me to reflect, and I realised that I felt connected to the history I was seeing there because my ancestors, whoever they were, were around at the time of Henry VIII. I did wonder, however, if the same could be said for some of my black friends. Maybe not, because the history of their ancestors at that time would of course be elsewhere. Some British black people will feel just as connected as I do but many will not. As a young black Londoner, Sam Kamasu, said to me only yesterday, young black people are not engaging with history as much as they should. Black youth in particular has such a multilayered history because black is such a large cluster-African and Caribbean, for instance. Many young people from  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_421"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 421</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this group struggle to find what history to connect with, especially second and third-generation migrants. At times they might find it difficult to identify with current course content. Allowing young people to shape their historical learning by choosing the content from earlier in the academic system may contribute to them being more inspired to keep on learning".</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="11102033000240"></a>I would ask the Minister to take this suggestion of allowing more choice in the content of the curriculum to Simon Schama, the Government's adviser, and to those within Britain's ethnic minorities whom Mr Schama and of course the department will be consulting with. Although many people acknowledge that the content of the curriculum has improved over recent years, many still feel that it does not appreciate the contribution of or tell the stories of those from Britain's newer communities. This gap is being filled by initiatives such as Black History Month.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="11102033000241"></a>I learnt much of the sacrifice of Commonwealth soldiers in World War 2 from speeches by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and novels such as <I>Small Island</I> by Andrea Levy. The Caribbean islanders were apparently never conscripted but chose to fight. It is stories like this that Britain's Caribbean community want emphasising in the nation's classrooms.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="11102033000242"></a>It is only since joining your Lordships' House that I have had to begin speaking publicly about multiculturalism and diversity. In my previous role, I would always ask members of Britain's black community to do this, not least because it is their tale often to tell. "My family history ends with a ship", said Bishop Wayne Malcolm in 2007 to a dumbstruck audience of 800 people, including the current Prime Minister. "Thank you for your ancestors' bravery and courage for bringing Christianity, healthcare and education to Ghana. Without their sacrifice, my family and I would not be where we are today". That is my summary of Reverend Kingsley Appiagyei's words to MPs, peers and councillors at a training event. Many had never before heard Britain's contentious missionary history so described.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="11102033000243"></a>These perspectives and the courageous stories of migration to the UK need telling in the nation's classrooms. I wonder if inviting different people into schools to tell their and their families' stories would aid our history teachers as well as building community relationships. I would be grateful if the Minister would consider this suggestion.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="11102033000244"></a>Simon Schama is right. We cannot be self-congratulatory but we may find that some of those most affected by our past are more at ease and forgiving about what happened than the English might expect or indeed deserve. So I would suggest that Britain's colonial history and the current heritage of the population necessitates that the national history taught in our classrooms contains strands of world history. Rightly or wrongly, Britain has been on the world stage and people came to live here as a result. This could be a tremendously exciting curriculum.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="11102033000245"></a>To conclude, it may seem too much perhaps to some people to link teaching history in schools, as I have done, to our national identity but I pray in aid the noble Lord, Lord Sacks, who in his book <I>The Home We Build Together</I> argues for the need for a fragmented Britain to build a covenantally based society; one  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_422"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 422</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>based on a mutually binding promise to one another sustained by loyalty, fidelity and faithfulness. He argues that a covenantally based society would,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000449"></a>"integrate diversity into national unity without asking anyone to abandon their independence or identity".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000246"></a>How does the noble Lord suggest such covenantal societies achieve this lofty goal? They tell a story.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="11102033000247"></a>So if telling our story in the nation's classrooms and through the media and around our dinner tables will give us anything like the strong sense of national identity the Jewish people around the world have retained, despite persecution and often living as a diaspora, it is a task well worth undertaking.</p>

It has been ill served by parliamentarians in recent years. One of the many reasons why I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Luke, for an excellent Motion is that it enables us to make amends.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="11102033000249"></a>New Labour served history ill. It was unaware of the historical dimension. The essential quality of New Labour was that it was new-therefore. the past dealt with the old and therefore it was of less significance. That is not true of the two Labour leaders whose biography I had the privilege of writing-Lord Callaghan and Michael Foot. Jim Callaghan was very interested in history, particularly naval history. Michael Foot wrote a famous book on the politics of Queen Anne. They had a sense of history. So, too, did my famous countryman Nye Bevan; he did not have much schooling and did not go to university but had his famous story about how he would walk the hills known to the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, above Tredegar. When he was lost he would turn to see where he had come from. The moral, said Nye, was that if you want to know where you are going you want to know where you have come from.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="11102033000250"></a>The present coalition is not much better. We have heard about the difficulties in schools where history is marginalised in the curriculum. We heard last week about how university funding for the teaching of history has been severely cut back, with serious effects on historical research. So history needs defending and yet it has, as so many noble Lords have said, huge appeal, growing journals and great appeal on television, particularly, I hope, when presented by professional historians and not by television personalities.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="11102033000251"></a>I never taught in a school, so to that degree I am totally unqualified to speak. I speak, perhaps, as a parent. The most successful course that my daughter did at her comprehensive school in Wales was one on social protest in Wales between 1800 and 1914. I believe it was written by one of my former pupils; perhaps I should declare an interest. It was very effective for many reasons, which produce some wider conclusions. First, it was about social history and change within society, particularly change in local society. You could see the toll houses or whatever the artefacts from the conflicts described were.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="11102033000252"></a>Secondly, it was covered through primary documents. It was very valuable for schoolchildren to look, for example, at some of the pamphlets of protest from that period.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_423"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 423</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="11102033000253"></a>Thirdly, it covered a decent span of time. I very much respond to what the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, said on this. It covered the whole of the 19th century, indicating that history should not be a pick and mix or based on snippets and soundbites. You should be able to study a problem over a prolonged period.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="11102033000254"></a>Fourthly, it was also about conflict. I do not want to be misunderstood on this but history is a record of collision-of colliding ideas, classes and social and political movements. We just lost the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Hurd. I wanted to mention Sir Robert Peel's career, of which the noble Lord wrote, which was about conflict over Catholic emancipation and the Corn Laws. It is very important that a history course for children should make the point that out of conflict can grow consensus. How was it, after those people were shot down outside the Westgate Hotel in Newport, that the Chartists' demands were, in the fullness of time, largely accepted? I do not mind history being about conflict. Better that it should be about that than a mindless conformism or a mindless patriotism. People have different views. To quote Nye Bevan again:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="11102033000430"></a>"You tell me your truth and I'll tell you mine".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000255"></a>That is the way to approach history.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="11102033000256"></a>The awareness of history is essential for the maturing and development of young people. It is accessible to everybody. As one who has spent-I am afraid-the past 50-odd years of my life writing and teaching history, it is important that I should always bear in mind that it is for everybody, not just for other historians. Outreach is very important. I always commend the Historical Association and never turn down an opportunity to speak to it, even if it is to 10 men and a dog on a wet night in Manchester. It is important to approach your audience in that open way, and to look at history in the round and at its artefacts. I enormously commend the work of National Heritage, chaired by my noble friend Lady Andrews, and, in particular, the work of the People's History Museum in Manchester, where you see documents and archives side by side with the physical artefacts of working-class history. It is nearly adjacent to the site of Peterloo, to which my noble friend Lady Bakewell referred.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="11102033000257"></a>There are many reasons to study history. It is fun; it stimulates curiosity; it is infinitely varied and colourful. It is a good intellectual training. It is not just a soft option for, as it were, would-be <I>Guardian</I> readers of the future. It is a powerful intellectual test. How do you know things? What is the evidence? How do you compare different kinds of evidence? When you consider such matters you do not need jargon. I am not so sure about some of my medieval colleagues but you do not need jargon; you can say it in plain English that everybody can understand. You do not need physical apparatus; you need only a working mind. History is available to all sentient beings.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="11102033000258"></a>As other noble Lords have said, history teaches a sense of perspective and change over time. This is true of even the contemporary history that some of us are said to teach. In even the most recent period, that is the essential sense that you must convey. You should extend it to everything-not just to anniversaries such as the 50th anniversary of some famous event but to  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_424"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 424</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>all the experiences of daily life. For schoolchildren daily life becomes alive if you stimulate the historical sense and it can be linked to the past. The greatest of all historians, Edward Gibbon, observed that his period in the Hampshire Grenadiers was not irrelevant to the historian of the Roman legions and the decline of the empire.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="11102033000259"></a>History gives children a sense of identity-of where they belong and who they are. Other countries are aware of this. In my wife's country, France, people would be astonished that history is not a compulsory part of our curriculum, as it is so powerfully there. History also gives a sense of a many-sided identity. People in this country have many identities. I have spent much of my career writing the history of Wales and the history of Britain and the north Atlantic side by side. It is interesting to see a different sense of relevance. For example, the Blue Books controversy of 1847, which is probably unknown to most of my audience and never mentioned in books on British history, is perhaps the most important event in 19th and 20th century Welsh history in stimulating a sense of nationality.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="11102033000260"></a>One must look at and reassess identity, not only because new research is being done and new facts released, but because you are writing in a society within a society that is itself changing. Therefore, the questions to do with the past that you are interested in are constantly changing. The noble Baroness who preceded me spoke very interestingly on multiculturalism and cultural identity. That is clearly an area where questions that are different from traditional themes have been posed. A few years ago there was an interesting series of commemorations to do with the ending of the slave trade in 1807. How refreshing it was to see that an awareness of the multicultural society led to understanding, and that it was not simply the work of a few benevolent white middle-class Englishmen. It was in fact a dynamic process in which black men and women also participated, which was as much a part of the great process of liberation as what was done in England.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="11102033000261"></a>History is the basis of a civilised society. A famous historian, JR Seeley said that it was "past politics". It is much more than that. It is capacious and contains multitudes. It is a mosaic of changing ideas, cultures and social formations. This should be reflected-I hope it is-in the way that history is taught in schools. I hope schools are not afraid of being conceptual and looking at the history of ideas. If we look at and celebrate Magna Carta in three years' time, I hope we do not approach it simply from the bad King John-or even the good King John-point of view, but from the ideas of human rights and the discussion of human rights down the centuries. Yesterday I took part in a debate on the terrorism prevention Bill. A brisk course in human rights would be instructive for the Front Benches on both sides of your Lordships' House.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="11102033000262"></a>Finally, history appeals to the most powerful of instincts: memory. The French are very aware of memory, not just the individual memory but the public memory-what the famous historian Pierre Nora called lieux de mémoire, or the sites of memories that have colonised and infiltrated the present. I hope history in schools can capture memory in its widest sense.</p>

The lessons of history are a valuable road map of how events and changes in society have affected the world we live in today. It is often said that we can learn from history and avoid making the same mistakes twice. The only problem I have with this is that many leaders and Governments around the world fail to take an even cursory look at a history book before plunging their countries and populations into catastrophic wars and devastating economic events.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="11102033000265"></a>Recent history is frequently airbrushed and adjusted to suit political and ideological ends. I find this deeply worrying because some of today's history books do not tell the full catalogue of events. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Berridge, I am personally concerned with the documentation of black history and that which applies to the diverse nature of Britain and the reasons why we have become such a rich multicultural society. The recent BBC2 television series "Mixed Race Britain" is, I believe, a landmark piece of television. It has made me aware of part of our history that I never knew had taken place. The programme is brilliantly researched and brilliantly documented. It reminds us of some of the most horrific episodes of racism in our recent history. It tells of Chinese fathers and husbands torn from the bosoms of their English wives and children in dawn raids and deported for no good reason, and of curfews forbidding black people to be out after dark. Yes, this all happened here in Britain less than a lifetime ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="11102033000266"></a>I have always gone to great lengths to explain to anyone who will listen that immigration to this country did not start with the Windrush, as many people seem to believe, and as the media continue constantly to reinforce. In 17th-century paintings by Hogarth we see the diverse nature of London, and yet it is rarely reflected in our history books that there has been diversity here since Roman times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="11102033000267"></a>In 1987, October was established as Black History Month here in Britain to celebrate and acknowledge the contribution of black people, and to educate and inform society about the important part that black people have played in history. To celebrate, over the past few weeks I have been touring schools across the country, speaking to children in both urban and rural areas about the experiences of those who came to the UK from the British Empire. I make them aware that there were thousands of people from Africa, India, China and the Caribbean here in Britain long before the 1950s. I explain how in Nelson's fleet many black sailors manned the ships; how in Devon there are graveyards with African names carved on the tombstones; how millions of people from Africa, the Indian sub-continent and Asia fought for Britain in the First and

The children I speak to absorb this information like sponges. It is a delight to see their minds opening up to history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="11102033000268"></a>I always find it amazing that so many films and television programmes fail to show the involvement of any of these groups of people when portraying these historic moments. Time and time again, with very few exceptions, films depicting the Elizabethan or Victorian eras fail to show people of colour as part of history. Even the story of the abolition of slavery frequently assigns the success of the campaign to William Wilberforce and his associates, often airbrushing out the black abolitionists who campaigned alongside them, as the noble Lord, Lord Morgan, highlighted just now. I find it sad, disheartening and frustrating that writers, researchers and directors fail to research past events correctly and truthfully and are therefore in effect changing history. That is why the teaching of accurate recent history in schools is so vital. If our young people grow up without learning and understanding history then we are making a terrible mistake, because the social make-up of our society is shaped by recent history. What vital lessons will be missed by our future leaders if they are not taught recent history in the classroom, history which is affecting their lives?</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="11102033000269"></a>Some of this history may be unpleasant. It may make us feel ashamed or guilty. But it must never be brushed under the carpet. Imagine if we allowed significant occurrences, violent conflicts, world changing political events, and the most evil and shocking atrocities of mankind's past, to be forgotten or erased from our history: the African Holocaust where millions of Africans died in enslavement, stripped of their religion, language and culture; the Jewish Holocaust of Hitler's Third Reich; the fall of the Berlin Wall; the assassinations of Martin Luther King and President John F. Kennedy; the Vietnam War; and most recently, the horrific events of 9/11, the Iraq war and the Afghanistan war. These episodes must never be forgotten.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="11102033000270"></a>I produced a television series recently called "Statues and Monuments". While we were filming a statue in central London a woman came up and said, "Why are you filming the statue of that man? He was a monster. What he did was evil. It should be torn down". I replied, "No. We have to remember what he represents, so that it can never happen again". We must never burn our history books. Our young people must be taught our past, so they will never make those same mistakes again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="11102033000271"></a>History is one of the most important subjects in the curriculum and it must continue to be taught in the hope of securing a more peaceful future. If some of our leaders over the past 50 years had spent more time studying history, how different things might be. The world might not be in the wounded state it is today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="11102033000272"></a>I love history and I loved studying history at school.

We must not deprive them of the rich lessons of the past. I ask the Minister to tell us how the Government will ensure that the teaching of history, including black history, remains a core subject for children of all cultures and all backgrounds throughout their time at school, to enable them to leave this world a better place than when they found it.</p>

I have to declare an interest, or perhaps more accurately a passion, as a practising professional historian, and acknowledge that I am the secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Archives and History. Perhaps I may say something briefly about that. One of the greatest pleasures of that role was the fact that earlier this year, the all-party group decided to make an award to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, who spoke earlier in the debate, and Professor Eric Hobsbawm, acknowledging the tremendous contribution they have made to the study of history in this country.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="11102033000274"></a>I want briefly to draw attention to the fact that it is often said that we are a parochial people. Actually, one of the most striking things about this country is the way in which, more than any other country in the world, we produce major historians of other people's countries. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, is a striking example of this. It is an indication of the fact that the accusation of parochialism in that respect is entirely false.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="11102033000275"></a>However, today I want to make the case for more teaching of British history in our schools, and I want to make it with some care. I accept in part the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, earlier in the debate that the school timetable is inevitably limited and other subjects have to be accommodated, and I suspect that it will be a struggle to find more time for history. But the content of what is being taught in our schools at the moment is a real issue. I also want to make clear the spirit in which I approach the issue of the teaching of British history in our schools. A diary entry for 13 September 1975 in John Rae's memoir-he was the headmaster of Westminster School and one of our progressive public school headmasters-goes as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="11102033000431"></a>"I am disturbed to read a series of articles in the <I>Times Educational Supplement</I> arguing that as Britain is now multicultural, schools should no longer pass on a monocultural tradition. What nonsense. If the history and literature of this country were watered down to suit ethnic minorities, the United Kingdom would be little more than a geographic expression".</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="11102033000276"></a>It would be easy for me to say in the aftermath of the speeches of the noble Baronesses, Lady Berridge and Lady Benjamin, that that is a very defensive and negative reaction. In fact, when I talk about the importance of teaching more British history in our schools, I want to make it clear that I do so entirely in the spirit of the two speeches we have just heard. But it is important to remember that, as his diary reveals, John Rae was an SDP voter at the time and saw himself as a progressive,  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_428"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 428</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as well as to recall the important changes that have occurred in our thinking about modern British history since then. It is also important to note that there can be no question of having a modern British history that does not acknowledge the multicultural realities of our society.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="11102033000277"></a>A couple of weeks ago I went to the University of Cambridge to give the first lecture on modern British history at a graduate seminar. I talked afterwards to dons and fellows of colleges, one of whom was a senior historian not born in this country, but taught and raised in a major European country. He has worked in Cambridge for the last few years. From his vantage point as a European, that historian expressed concerns about the way in which our undergraduates are now equipped as they arrive at university, even great universities like Cambridge and Oxford:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="11102033000432"></a>"There is no notion of the wider meaning of Britishness-Scotland, Wales and Ireland besides England-let alone the Anglo world of the Empire. This is manufacturing parochialism and it is altering the collective memory of where this country comes from".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000396"></a>The truth is that we have ended up manufacturing a certain form of parochialism. But the students all know about Hitler and world wars. I think that this is a real problem which we have to face up to. It is important to understand that if we want to teach people the virtues of tolerance as against intolerance, there are plenty of examples of this from our own British political history. If we want to teach people the importance of the equality of citizenship in our country, the struggle for Catholic emancipation is in its way as significant as the struggle for civil rights in the United States. It is important that people learn the lessons as they occurred in our own society.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="11102033000278"></a>It is also very important that the current debate does not become politicised. When we talk about the need for more British history, there is a danger that it becomes a kind of parody argument in which apparently those of us who are concerned about the subject want to hear more about kings and queens, make people learn more dates and so on. That is presented against the exciting and interesting things to be learnt by studying Hitler. This is truly a parody. In fact, within the historical profession at the moment there is a burgeoning consensus around the issue. It is important to avoid a false right/left debate on the subject. There are Conservatives-the noble Lord, Lord Luke, remarked on the failure to understand who Churchill was in our history-who are concerned about the knowledge of British history among our young people, but it is also the case that Tristram Hunt, probably the most distinguished historian in the new Labour intake in the other place and the great biographer of Engels, is also on the record as saying that we do now need more British history in our schools.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="11102033000279"></a>It is absolutely vital that we do not have a sterile right/left debate, one that has already started to a degree in the <I>London Review of Books</I>. There is actually a burgeoning consensus among historians, and it is absolutely vital that we acknowledge that if there is a patriotic tradition in this country, it is of the left as well as of the right, and of the centre. We cannot have more history about Nelson and Wellington without Peterloo and the Tolpuddle martyrs. I heartily endorse

There is no need to get involved in a false argument. I conclude by asking a question. Is there a case for a national council of historians to advise on these matters? One of the remarkable things about the British historical profession is that it is very good and has a tremendous range of scholars working within it. Probably what happens on the whole in our schools does not fully reflect the actual quality of work that goes on among British historians and their commitment to knowledge of the past. There is the possibility to avoid sterile polemics and to proceed on the basis of understanding and agreement. I hope it is something that the Government might give just a little thought to.</p>

I was going to tell the same sad tale told by my noble friend Lord Luke concerning the seven year-old boy on the Tube. I would add only this. Only this morning I spoke to the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, who thought that the boy who did not know what the navy was, was in fact aged nine, which makes it somewhat more shocking. It was suggested during the ensuing lively conversation on the Tube that the noble Lord should continue his journey in order to enlighten further passengers on naval history. He is not in his place, so I can only assume that he remains on the Circle Line.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="11102033000281"></a>That is an extreme example of the decline in the importance and value of teaching history in schools. The publication in 2007 of the Ofsted report entitled <I>History in the B</I><I>alance</I> and subsequently <I>History </I><I>F</I><I>or </I><I>A</I><I>ll</I>, published in 2011, focus on the problems. First, there are the positive signs. The 2011 report shows that history teaching in 63 out of 83 primary schools and 59 out of 83 secondary schools surveyed was outstanding. It was also noted that since the 2007 report, greater use of ICT among pupils engendered more interest and facilitated more self-learning in history. History as an optional course is better taught at key stage 4 and in the sixth form, with the numbers of students increasing. This is reflected in the increase in demand for history courses at UK universities.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="11102033000282"></a>However, there remain some fundamental underlying problems. At primary school stage, the 2007 report found that key stage 2 pupils made slow progress in history, a subject too often neglected in favour of literacy and numeracy. There was no discernible improvement highlighted in the 2011 report. Furthermore, teachers were found to lack confidence in teaching history, based on a lack of specific subject knowledge. In some primary and secondary schools, teaching fell short in providing a clear chronology of events, a timeline linking major events through the millennia to provide a perspective.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="11102033000397"></a>Schools remain too parochial in focusing on English history to the detriment of the history of Scotland, Ireland and Wales, and indeed the rest of the world. Episodic teaching is introduced too early in the curriculum. With some trepidation, my views differ from the noble  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_430"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 430</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Thomas, and my noble friend, Lord Cormack, in that I believe it is important to have a great depth of knowledge of the history of the great continents in addition to that of the UK. For example, how can we understand the relative decline of the USA if we do not understand the recent rise in influence of China and India?</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="11102033000283"></a>The major problems remain at key stage 3. In the maintained sector, only 30 per cent of pupils study history after the age of 14, with even fewer after the age of 16, as the subject becomes optional in marked contrast to many European countries. History is marginalised-and too early-in favour of vocational subjects. The 2011 report pointed out that major disruptive curriculum changes at key stage 3 impacted negatively on 14 out of 58 secondary schools surveyed. In some schools at A-level there is an overdependence on the set texts, which stifles independent research, leaving pupils ill-prepared for higher education where research and analytical skills are required.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="11102033000284"></a>A crucial question is: how important is the teaching of history in schools in the context of the demand to teach key subjects such as maths and English in addition to the provision of some vocational training? Its importance cannot be overestimated. The historian Anthony Beevor has stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="11102033000433"></a>"Without an understanding of history we are politically, culturally and socially impoverished".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000398"></a>His own historical masterpiece entitled <I>D-Day</I> is an outstanding example of a readable tale focusing on the lead up to D-Day and its aftermath written from the Axis and Allied perspective. It is well researched, written wholly objectively and provides a moving human perspective on the characters of the leaders and the decisions made at the time.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="11102033000285"></a>History teaching stands proud in providing the foundation skills for a range of related university courses, including sociology, politics, international relations and economics. Vocationally, it also provides a basis for studying law, for entry to the Civil Service and the private sector. History teaches us how to research, analyse and assimilate information and draw our own conclusions from decisions made in the past. These skills are invaluable for careers where writing reports or making presentations is essential.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="11102033000286"></a>History is interesting and there is a need to bring it alive for pupils in schools. Edmund Burke wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="11102033000434"></a>"History consists for the greater part of the miseries brought upon the world by pride, ambition, avarice, revenge, lust, sedition, hypocrisy, ungoverned zeal and all the train of disorderly appetite".</p>

<p><a name="11102033000399"></a>On this basis, if there were a Richter scale for excitement, history should surely be ranked 10, well above reality TV programmes or the PlayStation.</p>

<p><a name="11102033000400"></a>It is how history is taught that is so important. There is a need for improved teacher training in this respect and better subject-specific training. More creativity is also required in schools for relating history teaching to a link with the local community, as the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, has pointed out. Last week in this House during a Question on war memorial gardens, the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, wisely suggested that schools adopt a local war memorial to allow pupils to learn and understand its local importance.</p>

<p><a name="11102033000401"></a>In conclusion, I ask the Minister two questions. First, what plans are in place for substantially improving the training of teachers in history? Secondly, are there plans for increasing the age threshold for the compulsory teaching of history? Arnold Toynbee famously stated that history is,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000450"></a>"just one damned thing after another".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000402"></a>This is a truism, but it masks the positive fact that the study of history builds up an invaluable mental library to help us lead our own lives better. We must start at least by ensuring that all nine year-old boys know what the navy is.</p>

I have some remarks to address to him specifically.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="11102033000288"></a>Let me first of all declare an interest-an interest in history. I cannot declare any other; it is more than a decade since I participated in an education debate due to other obligations in government, and it is almost 50 years since I taught history in higher education. It seems a very long time ago. What I delight in today is the variety of contributions. There are some that I have warmed to very strongly and some that I have reservations about which I will make clear in a moment.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="11102033000289"></a>What has come through so strongly is the importance of history. The Minister ought to appreciate that this debate about history in schools and proposals for the future is of the greatest significance. We have certainly put to rest Henry Ford's statement that "history is bunk". Henry Ford said that in a particular context to emphasise the new technology in the age of the motor car, but in Detroit he leaves behind a museum of history which is almost unparalleled elsewhere in its range of exhibits, and is proof positive of the value of bringing to the American people-and people from the rest of the world who have had the privilege of going there-a real interest in the development of our technological and industrial history, so even Henry did not really think that history was bunk.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="11102033000290"></a>I warm rather more to the fact that history is the memory of our civilisations, of our country and of mankind. Without an understanding of the past, how can we make intelligible the nature of the world in which we live? History is also partial, selective, subjective and determined by interpretation. That is not to say that good historians-certainly not the historians who grace this debate today-are in any way shape or form disrespectful of facts. Facts are sacred, but often the problem for historians is agreement about the facts, and in particular the interpretation to be put upon them. It is important that we recognise that history is evidence-based and the sacredness of the facts, but also that all who study history need not just a narrative but an appreciation of the way in which the historian works. It will not do to think that we can hand down easy truths in areas where inevitably history is about disputation, uncertainty and interpretation. That is why the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, is able to take a party of schoolchildren through the building and glory

It is also why I can take a party of schoolchildren and identify my criticisms of some of the choices made. Why certain figures are in the Royal Gallery and others are not is a judgment reflective of the 19th century when this Palace was created. The depiction of history through our various Lobbies is a distinct interpretive act. I am not against it; I love this place. I am not against anything which helps to communicate to people the sense of our history. However, I am also at pains to ensure that people recognise that there is more than one dimension to the island's story as portrayed in this building.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="11102033000291"></a>That is why my concern in this debate is that the Government purport to be reaching judgments with regard to teaching in schools. A mightily important obligation is on the Secretary of State and his fellow Ministers when they reach these judgments. We should have some anxiety. After all, we do not have a Secretary of State who hides his light under a bushel when it comes to a commitment to a set of values. We all know the ideological stance which he has taken with regard, for example, to Atlantic Bridge. We also know the extent to which he is determined to be proactive. I ask merely this of the Minister: will he ensure that the level and range of advice that the Secretary of State obtains on this most important of scholastic areas is broader than it looks to be at present? Like everyone else in this House, I have delighted in the work of Simon Schama. I enjoyed hugely his narrative account of the French Revolution. For those of us who had weltered under highly tendentious and challenging interpretations of the revolution in which, on the whole, narrative development was limited and the identification of a particular perspective was more important, Simon Schama's book came like a breath of fresh air and renewed for many a great interest in the revolution. However, it is a narrative. It is an account which is highly challenged by other historians. That is why, although I have nothing but respect for Simon Schama as a historian, if it is suggested that he is the historian primarily advising the Secretary of State, this House should express anxiety.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="11102033000292"></a>This has been a debate which ought to have warmed the hearts of all of us who are concerned about history in all the great dimensions that have been put forward from such authoritative sources, but it is also a debate which is topical and relevant-that is why the noble Lord, Lord Luke, should be congratulated on raising it. It means that the Government must be fully charged of the fact that history cannot just be the concept of an easy, consensual narrative of the island's story. History is far more complex and challenging than that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Benjamin, identified in her contribution, and we ought to respect that in any judgments that we reach.</p>

Nevertheless, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Luke, for initiating the debate. From the speeches that we have heard, it seems that there is little consensus in this House except on two things: first, that history is very

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="11102033000294"></a>In schools, as many noble Lords have said, there is a need to impart a sense of continuity and sequence of the past. However, as my noble friend Lord Addington said, history is now so vast that it would take almost a lifetime-you would certainly have to enrol in the University of the Third Age-to complete an in-depth study from the early times to the present.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="11102033000295"></a>We must get away from the notion that history had a golden past. My own history education lacked any sense of continuity or sequence. I learnt about the Romans and the Vikings, then jumped to the Tudors and the Stuarts. Finally, at A-level, I studied 19th and 20th-century European and British-by which I mean essentially English-history. As a result, I knew very little about the medieval period and the 18th century, and virtually nothing about the histories of Ireland, Scotland and Wales or the United States. Never once in those far-off days when we took O-level and A-level in history were we required to examine original sources. History education has come a long way in recent years by requiring pupils at quite a young age and subsequently to learn how to use original sources. In my case, the fragmented and disjointed knowledge of history that I acquired was not at all unique. Others have mentioned that they had similar experiences.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="11102033000296"></a>The school curriculum, even if it cannot cover the whole course of history, should, as my good friend, the noble Lord, Lord Morgan, said, take sufficiently long a period so that one can convey a sense of sequence and development. That requires that history should be accorded a secure place in the syllabus at both primary and secondary levels. Michael Gove, the Secretary of State, has clearly recognised this.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="11102033000297"></a>The curriculum should not be chauvinistic or xenophobic, although I have to say-here I echo the reservations of the noble Lord, Lord Davies-that Mr Gove's approach seems to hint at this. It should not concentrate just on monarchy, the military and empire. Rather, as many noble Lords have said, it should give an appreciation of other aspects. In a devolved kingdom, particularly, we should these days have a sense of the history of Ireland, Scotland and Wales if we are to maintain some sense of a United Kingdom. There have been many criticisms that recent and contemporary history predominates and that, as the noble Lord, Lord Bew, said, students come up to university knowing about Hitler but have not gone much further than that. In my experience when I was in Northern Ireland, my daughter took a GCSE in history and was compelled to take a paper in the history of Ireland. That stopped quite abruptly at 1919, for obvious reasons, so it is not always contemporary. In certain circumstances, you find that you are not allowed to look at more contemporary features.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="11102033000298"></a>As my noble friend Lady Benjamin and others have said, there must be a large focus on the UK's position in the world. As was said earlier, if the habit of continuous military adventurism persists there is a strong case for giving a hefty dose of the history of the Middle East. Perhaps Afghanistan would make a good special paper at A-level and any intending candidates

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="11102033000299"></a>At university level, history is almost in extremis. As the debate in your Lordships' House last week on the condition of the English universities illustrated, in speech after speech, the arts and humanities-of which history is a main constituent-were shown to be in dire straits. It is significant that in the <I>Guardian</I> today the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, an eminent medical scientist, very eloquently comes out defending the arts, social sciences and the humanities as being equally vital alongside more vocational subjects and disciplines.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="11102033000300"></a>Not only is the teaching of History at risk but, as others have remarked, the quality of historical research is being jeopardised. It is research that nurtures university teaching which, in turn, informs and keeps fresh the teaching in schools. The future history teachers in our country are being short-changed, and will be increasingly so, by the parsimony of university funding. In every sense, history will not take kindly to the financial treatment currently being meted out to it. Along with others, I ask the Minister whether he is able to offer any crumbs of comfort that will convincingly provide grounds for a degree of optimism in this regard.</p>

He has raised some challenging questions about the future of history teaching and the need, which he rightly identified, to narrow the knowledge gap between rich and poor so that all children can excel. We have also, thankfully, had a measured and extremely well informed debate today. I did not realise that there were quite so many history teachers in your Lordships' Chamber but I have certainly found the debate enlightening. I have also very much welcomed the tone in which the debate has taken place. All too often when these subjects are debated they can dissolve into myth and political discourse.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="11102033000302"></a>We have also had some passionate contributions about the wider role of history in establishing truth and fact. I particularly commend the exposition from my noble friends Lady Andrews and Lady Bakewell on the wider benefits of a good grounding in history. I also look forward to hearing the response of the noble Lord, Lord Hill, who I understand is also an expert on this subject. I am sure that he will also give a thoughtful and reflective analysis of the problems which we are now confronting.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="11102033000303"></a>We all understand the importance of history in helping us to understand progress, the development of our society and our place in the world today. We also recognise the academic and personal skills that flow from learning to analyse and question, and to differentiate between historical fact and fiction. As my noble friend Lord Morgan rightly pointed out, it gives a good intellectual training.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="11102033000304"></a>As several noble Lords pointed out and argued persuasively, it also gives us a sense of identity and belonging and creates a memory of a nation. It also sometimes, as the noble Baroness, Lady Benjamin,  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_435"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 435</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pointed out, scandalously writes some of our citizens out of history, and that cannot be tolerated. As politicians we are keenly aware that we need to learn from history and that the two disciplines are closely intertwined. We are also aware that even in the hands of the most careful practitioner history can be subjective and distorted. This is why individual politicians should be wary of interfering in the shape of the syllabus. I am very pleased that Michael Gove enjoyed studying history at school. He obviously enjoyed a particular style of teaching, and I have no doubt that it works well for some people, but this does not justify him recreating his own teaching experience in every school in the country. Surely he should, instead, be drawing upon the best professional advice as to how children learn effectively and the best academic experience of history teachers in the classroom. It may well be that the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Bew, of a national advisory body of historians could provide focus for this.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="11102033000305"></a>Several noble Lords have quoted Simon Schama, who is one of the advisers brought in to shape the new syllabus. I understand that he will be working with Andrew Roberts and Niall Ferguson, notable academics in their own right. They have been very vocal in their criticisms of the current teaching of history, so at least that has helped to provoke a debate. However, as my noble friend Lord Davies argued, they have a particular ideological focus, which is raising some concerns among teachers and parents. Particular alarm bells rang for me when I read that Niall Ferguson had created a war games video to teach young people about the Second World War. He described how his two young sons had enjoyed playing it, but that his daughter had shown no interest in playing war games. That is no surprise. I found myself thinking that Michael Gove might have been better advised to ask some women to join his team of advisers. They might have had a better idea of the sorts of issues which would inspire the imagination of young women in learning history.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="11102033000306"></a>Nevertheless, on some things the advisers are right. We all are concerned about the fall in take-up of history GCSE. While history remains a statutory part of the curriculum up to the age of 14, the numbers taking the subject beyond this have been reducing, as we have heard, with only 30 per cent of students taking the subject at GCSE in maintained schools. As both Ofsted and the Historical Association have identified, there are a number of reasons for this. First, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, rightly pointed out, there is a lack of specialist teaching in schools, leaving many young people with little or no teaching from history graduates trained to teach the subject. Of course, this problem becomes self-perpetuating as the lower numbers taking the subject to A-level and beyond affect the future supply of qualified teachers.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="11102033000307"></a>Secondly, there has been a reduction in the time allocated to the subject as the curriculum is squeezed with other priorities or history is combined into a more general humanities course in which the specifics of the discipline can be lost. Thirdly, there are restrictions placed on the subjects that some young people are able to study at GCSE, with history not being an option, or only available if other humanities are dropped. Finally,  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_436"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 436</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there are concerns about the inconsistency of exam boards regarding marking, course materials and the criteria for assessment, which puts some students off. So there are undoubtedly a number of structural problems with the curriculum offer which militate against a large uptake of history at GCSE. Incidentally, I am not sure that these problems will be solved by the introduction of the English baccalaureate, which specifies that only one humanities subject should be part of the award.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="11102033000308"></a>This issue of the time available to teach particular subjects is more fundamental than might at first appear. It may be that the previous Government allowed the curriculum to become too crowded, but there is always pressure, as we have heard, to add new and justifiable subjects to the list. Conversely, it is rare for anybody to make a case for a subject to be dropped from the curriculum; and just as that applies to the curriculum as a whole, it also applies with individual subjects. I have listened carefully today to the many persuasive contributions on what should be included in the history syllabus, and it would be easy to agree with everyone. Issues raised have included the significance of the French revolution, the origins of the slave trade, our links with Afghanistan, the history of our relations with the Middle East; the need to understand people's history, social history, local history, the history of the four UK nations, the history of English literature and art; the development of science and technology and the history of multiculturalism, to touch on just a few. I endorse all of those. They all have a legitimate place in the curriculum. However, we also need to be realistic about what can be achieved in, say, two hours a week up to year nine and maybe three hours a week at GCSE over a 38-week academic year. It is simply not possible to have both the breadth and the depth that we might all desire.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="11102033000309"></a>This dichotomy has led to one of the central failings in the teaching of history, which is identified by Ofsted and on which we can probably all agree. It reported that pupils were being let down by a lack of chronological understanding of the subject. In particular, it reported that pupils at primary schools,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000451"></a>"knew about particular events, characters and periods but did not have an overview. Their chronological understanding was often underdeveloped and so they found it difficult to link developments together".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000403"></a>I very much support the idea that a stronger strand of chronology should underpin the history syllabus, but this is very different from the Secretary of State's apparent mission to return to learning dates by rote. At a time when our challenge is to excite pupils and capture their imagination about the past, there would be nothing more dull and uninspiring than to force feed them with dates of wars and of births and deaths of kings and queens.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="11102033000310"></a>It is an accepted fact among most educationalists that individual children have different techniques for learning and remembering. The real skill of a classroom teacher is to teach in such a way that every child can get the maximum benefit from the lesson. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, pointed out, the current history syllabus meets many of the concerns that have been raised today. The noble Lord, Lord Cormack, disagreed, but this matter can easily be resolved by  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_437"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 437</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>looking at the facts. The Ofsted report was much more positive about the current history provision than we have been led to believe by some commentators. It is an area in which myths have been flourishing. Just as it is not possible to avoid being deported by owning a cat, it is equally not true that Henry VIII and Hitler are the only individuals studied in the syllabus. In fact, as we have heard, the syllabus is littered with leaders, explorers, inventors and dissenters. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, rightly pointed out, on any named subject at any time, we always believe that it was taught better in the past and are nostalgic for the way that we were taught it at school.</p>

<p><a name="st_99"></a>

However, we need to scrutinise objectively what is happening in the classroom. In its report earlier this year, <I>History for All</I>, Ofsted praised the teaching at key stage 2, describing pupils as having a,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000452"></a>"detailed knowledge derived from well-taught studies of individual topics";</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000404"></a>while at secondary level it described how,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000453"></a>"effective teaching by well-qualified and highly competent teachers enabled the majority of students to develop knowledge and understanding in depth".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000405"></a>It went on to identify that students displayed,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000454"></a>"a healthy respect for historical evidence",</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000406"></a>and had the skills to apply critical judgment to support their analysis. Throughout the Ofsted report the skills of the specialist history teachers who knew their subjects well and were able to inspire their pupils were a common theme. Surely we should value and celebrate the contribution of these teachers rather than alarm them with talk of further upheaval.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="11102033000313"></a>In conclusion, I hope that the Minister agrees with me that there is a need, first, to tackle the structural reasons why history teaching is in decline and is fighting for space in the school week. Secondly, we need to look again at how the syllabus can be adjusted to allow the chronology and sweep of history to be better understood. Thirdly, we need to engage with history teachers, value what they achieve and listen to their ideas for reform. Politicians should refrain from meddling in an educational agenda fraught with ideological divides, and should perhaps also recruit some women to advise on the really significant events in history and how they might be taught. Then we might inspire a new generation of young people to study history, develop the skills of analysis and apply the lessons learnt so that they can better interpret their lives today.</p>

Like other noble Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Luke for securing the debate, getting it off to such a good start and setting out the issues for us so clearly.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="11102033000315"></a>Everyone else seems to have been declaring an interest, so I had better do so. I must correct the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch-I am not an expert, but as a boy I was hooked by RJ Unstead's <I>Story of Britain</I>, with those wonderful illustrations by Victor Ambrus. I still have my copy at home and I should be happy to share it with anyone who has not read it. I also remember as a boy being fascinated by an encyclopaedia's picture of French aristocrats being taken off in a tumbrel, and one of Constantine XI fighting heroically on the walls of Constantinople. I suspect that it was an early sign of a lifelong commitment to lost causes, with which I persist to this day.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="11102033000316"></a>I started to read history at university but I am afraid I did not complete it because I did not have the sticking power-it was a PhD on Russian history with Norman Stone. However, it was in the 1990s that a stint at Downing Street opened my eyes to medieval history because it dawned on me that I was effectively working in a medieval court. For the first time, I realised why the role of Keeper of the Stool was such an important job because, as political secretary, I spent a lot of my time going round clearing up after powerful people.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="11102033000317"></a>I therefore share the views expressed by all noble Lords about the importance of history, which was set out so powerfully by the noble Lord, Lord Morgan, and from another but equally important perspective by my noble friends Lady Benjamin and Lady Berridge. I think that there is agreement that history helps us to understand our common past, our shared values and our sense of national identity-a point made by my noble friend Lord Cormack, but underlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews. She correctly said that history teaching is more important than ever as our society becomes more varied. Understanding history helps us to make sense of the present, as has been argued by a number of noble Lords. It develops analytical skills and helps us to understand cause and effect-one of the points that the noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, underlined. History helps give us the ability to argue and enables us all to make connections. Everyone here is agreed on the importance of history as a subject.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="11102033000318"></a>We heard a number of examples of some of the things that people do not know about history. We heard about Churchill. I saw another survey that suggested that nearly half the young people aged between 18 and 24 did not know that Nelson commanded the fleet at Trafalgar and led it to victory. Nearly half did not know that the Romans built Hadrian's Wall. That links to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Bew, about the importance of British history. He made an extremely important point about the opportunity we have to avoid a false left/right divide on this. For most of the time in this debate we have managed to avoid that. I accept that it is impossible to dissociate history and the study of it from a political perspective. However, we have been discussing the chronology and the sequencing of history-some of the great events. Noble Lords may think that I am a mad optimist but it  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_439"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 439</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is possible to separate some of the facts of our history and of world history. My noble friend Lord Smith of Clifton made the important point that we increasingly need our children to have an awareness of world history. However, it is possible to separate an understanding of fact from interpretation. Interpretation is something that comes increasingly with age and knowledge, but there is a factual basis that we should be able to work hard to identify.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="11102033000319"></a>In terms of current take-up we know that, alongside geography and modern foreign languages, the number of pupils taking history has been falling. It is down from 39 per cent doing GCSE in 1995, to 30 to 31 per cent last year. The proportion taking A-level has been static and the number of students studying history at university has risen, but that rise is slower than the average increase in university enrolments generally. We also know that while just over 30 per cent of children in maintained schools took a history GCSE in 2010, nearly half of children in independent schools did so. That relates to a point well made by a number of noble Lords about the importance of making sure that all our children have a chance to study history, and that those from more disadvantaged backgrounds do not miss out on the opportunity to do so.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="11102033000320"></a>My noble friend Lord Younger of Leckie told us about the Ofsted report in 2010. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, also referred to it and was absolutely right to say that the report found much to commend in the teaching of history at both primary and secondary level and in the work that our teachers are doing. It found many examples of extremely good practice. I very much associate myself with that point of view.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="11102033000321"></a>The Ofsted report also said-and this point has been recognised and accepted on all sides of the House-that at primary level,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000455"></a>"some pupils found it difficult to place the historical episodes they had studied within any coherent, long-term narrative... Their chronological understanding was often underdeveloped and so they found it difficult to link developments together".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000407"></a>They also commented that,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000456"></a>"the curriculum structure for primary schools was itself episodic".</ul>
<p><a name="11102033000408"></a>That links to some of the points made by my noble friend Lady Walmsley. The report recommended that pupils should study overview as well as in-depth topics. That relates to a point about bore-holes and breadth, raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews. Ofsted also thought, again relating to the important point raised by my noble friend Lady Walmsley, that primary school teachers needed more subject-specific continuous professional development opportunities and that all students in secondary schools should benefit from a significant amount of history until at least 14.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="11102033000322"></a>I felt there was broadly a shared analysis of what we think the main issues confronting us are. There are concerns about the bitty nature of the curriculum and a lack of sweep and chronological development, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Morgan; about the support available to teachers to enable them to teach history well and more broadly; and about the time available in the timetable for teaching history,

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="11102033000323"></a>I will try to set out what the Government are doing in three broad areas: first, the curriculum; secondly, encouraging the take-up of history; and thirdly, support for teachers and initial teacher training. So far as the curriculum is concerned, we had an extremely good debate which flushed out some of the difficulties. The noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, talked about curriculum wars and the history of that; my noble friend Lord Addington talked about fashions. Both those points are well made. I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, agrees with our argument that, as the national curriculum developed, it has covered more subjects, prescribed more outcomes and taken up more school time than originally intended.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="11102033000324"></a>Overall, our intention through the curriculum review is to slim the curriculum down; to free up time in the school day; and to free teachers to use their judgment to design curricula that best meet needs of their pupils. We want the new national curriculum to be based on a body of essential knowledge that children should be expected to acquire in key subjects during their school career, to cover for all children their cultural and scientific inheritance-an important point was made about the importance of science and technology-to enhance their understanding of the world around them, and to expose them, if we can, to the best of what has been thought and written.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="11102033000325"></a>The review is being conducted in two phases. In the first phase, we are designing new programmes of study for those subjects-English, maths, science and PE-which we have already confirmed will continue to be a part of the national curriculum at all four key stages. We are also considering which of the other subjects that currently form the national curriculum, including history, should be part of the national curriculum in future and at which key stages. The second phase of the review, which will start in early 2012, will produce programmes of study for those other subjects which remain within the national curriculum. The review will also advise on whether non-statutory programmes of study should be published for any subjects that are not to be included in the new national curriculum.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="11102033000326"></a>The review began with a public call for evidence that invited views from all interested parties on what a new curriculum should look like. I understand that the call for evidence closed on 14 April; the results will be published in due course. There will be further widescale public consultation before any final decision is made. I agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, that it is important that there should be widespread discussion representing a range of views.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="11102033000327"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, specifically asked whether the EBacc is having any effect on encouraging the take-up of history. The Government think that a child's education is diminished without a sound understanding of history. We know that history, alongside some other subjects, has been in decline for a number of years. The Government believe that there are some academic subjects, the core subjects in the English baccalaureate-English, maths, the sciences,  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_441"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 441</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>languages and humanity-in which too few pupils are achieving, or have even had the opportunity to study. As my noble friend Lord Luke pointed out at the beginning of the debate, the situation is worse for pupils on free school meals. The disparity between the percentage of those on free school meals who are taking the EBacc subjects-which the Russell Group of universities states are those that best equip children to take degrees in its universities-and others is very large. Only 4 per cent of children on free school meals achieved the EBacc subjects last year, whereas for children as a whole across the country, the figure was 16 per cent. We need to address that issue.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="11102033000328"></a>I know that all noble Lords believe that many more pupils have the potential to succeed in those subjects, and we feel that we should do everything that we can to help them have that opportunity. We know that pupils who have achieved the EBacc combination of subjects have proved more likely to go onto A-levels, have attempted a greater number of A-levels and have achieved better results. We are trying through the EBacc to allow parents and pupils to see for the first time how their school is performing against those key academic subjects. In doing so, we hope to encourage a greater number of schools to offer a broader set of academic subjects, which would include history, to more of their pupils.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="11102033000329"></a>The early indications are that the introduction of the EBacc is encouraging the take-up of history. Some research was carried out on behalf of the department by the National Centre for Social Research over the summer. That suggests that 39 per cent of pupils entering GCSEs in 2013 are expected to take history. If that turns out to be the case, that would be up by 8 per cent from this year and back to the level that it was that in 1995. Time will tell whether that turns out to be true, but I hope noble Lords who are keen, as we all are, to see more children carrying on with history up to the age of 16 will regard that as an encouraging sign.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="11102033000330"></a>That is linked with the important question about teacher supply and teacher training. The EBacc does have implications for teacher supply. If more children want to study history, we will need to have more history teachers. The modelling undertaken by the department to set future-year ITT places is taking that into account. I am told that there is currently healthy interest in training to become a history teacher. My noble friend Lady Walmsley rightly mentioned the importance of CPD, or continuing professional development. Our overall approach to that was laid out in our White Paper published in November 2010. In broad terms we are trying to improve the capacity for schools to take the lead for the training and development of teachers and to create more opportunities for peer-to-peer learning, which is what we have been doing this afternoon. Our approach is based on research that shows that teachers learn best through observing teaching and being observed and receiving feedback from other professionals. We are creating a new national network of teaching schools which will give outstanding schools the role of leading the training and professional development of teachers and head teachers so that all schools have better access to high-quality professional and leadership development. The first 100 teaching

They will be the embodiment of our commitment to CPD and will run a range of programmes for schools, including in history, to help address some of these important issues.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="11102033000331"></a>Earlier this year we published an initial teacher training strategy which is out for discussion at the moment. That contains proposals for giving schools the opportunity to play a greater role in teacher training, the funding of ITT, toughening the entry criteria, and prioritising training most relevant to classroom practice. We are finalising proposals for initial teacher training in the light of responses we have received to that and we will publish a plan shortly. We believe overall, alongside work we are doing in looking at proposals for a single set of new standards for all qualified teachers, that these reforms, the network of teaching schools and a new set of teacher standards will improve the rigour and quality of teaching in all subjects, including history.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="11102033000332"></a>An interesting part of the debate was on issues around learning outside the classroom, enthusiasm and the importance of enthusiastic teachers, and accessibility. My noble friend Lady Berridge rightly talked about the importance of bringing outsiders in. The noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, talked about the kind of work that English Heritage and other organisations can do to enthuse and inspire children and bring history to life in a way that someone standing up in a classroom will not necessarily do. I do not think that helping children have a better sense of the chronology of the events in history needs to come from a dry as dust, learning by rote, going back to the 1950s approach to teaching. The development of the media and all kinds of new ways of learning that all of us, unfortunately, were not able to benefit from provide fantastic opportunities for children to become engaged in and get a love of history and be excited and inspired by it. Learning outside the classroom is extremely important and going to battlefields, visiting the Imperial War Museum and going to Dover Castle-which I would love to do one day if I am invited-are all ways that we can bring history to life. We think schools can work out how to do that but there is more the Government can do to make it easier for them to take pupils on trips by taking steps to reduce teachers' fears of legal action for failures in the dreaded and sometimes mythical area of health and safety. We want teachers to be confident that they can take pupils to this kind of activity, and we will work with the Health and Safety Executive on that.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="11102033000333"></a>I remember reading a few years back pronouncements that history was dead. Today's debate shows that it is very much alive. We know that there are more history books being written and that there is more history on the television; we have heard about the interest people have in archaeology and in their own ancestry. As was said, history is full of ripping yarns. There is no doubting the passion and knowledge brought to us in today's debate. I do not share the knowledge of all noble Lords-for instance, that of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton-but I hope that at least I share some of the passion expressed this afternoon. I will bring the debate to the attention of my honourable friend Mr Gibb, who is leading our curriculum review,

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="11102033000334"></a>The Government take this seriously. There is much more work to do, but I hope that we may have started to turn the corner. The timing of the debate, as the Government consider the national curriculum review, is excellent. I congratulate my noble friend Lord Luke on it once again, and on providing us all with the opportunity for the thoughtful discussion that we had.</p>

For centuries they have been a driving force for common endeavour and mutual support. From high street co-operatives to pubs and football clubs, from healthcare to agriculture and from education to local shops, co-operatives and credit unions are cornerstones of our communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="11102033000337"></a>The strength of the co-operative economy today, with more than £30 billion in turnover and more than 13 million members, is testimony to the trust and value that we place in them. Credit union membership continues to grow across Great Britain, enhancing the diversity of our financial services, with membership on track to exceed 1 million this year. Despite a difficult economic environment, credit unions continue to provide much needed finance and support to local people and communities. Co-operatives and credit unions are a key element of the coalition Government's vision to empower local communities. Both will benefit from the changes introduced by the legislative reform  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_444"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 444</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>order that we are debating today, which will reduce burdens and remove obstacles to enable them to grow and extend their services to new members.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="11102033000338"></a>The legislative reform order has been a long time in the making. Consultations with the mutual sector began in 2007, and co-operatives and credit unions took the lead in proposing measures designed to bring their regulatory and legislative frameworks into the 21st century. The proposals themselves fall into two parts: those applying to co-operatives and those applying to credit unions.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="11102033000339"></a>There are six proposals of benefit to co-operatives. The first abolishes the minimum age for membership and reduces it for those wishing to hold office. This will enable young people to engage more actively with their local co-op, and in some cases to become officers sitting on their local committees. The second removes the restriction on the maximum holding of non-withdrawable shares in a co-operative. This will enable co-operatives to raise capital more easily.</p>
<a name="time_32"></a>
<a name="111020-0002.htm_time10"></a><h5><a name="11102033000490"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="11102033000340"></a>The other four proposals remove burdens and increase choice for co-operatives by: allowing them to choose their own year-end dates; removing the requirement to have interim accounts audited; permitting them to charge non-members for copies of their rules, while protecting the rights of existing members; and enabling easier dissolution. Taken collectively, these measures will have a positive impact in reducing burdens on co-operatives, removing unnecessary costs estimated to total £33 million, and delivering net benefits from improved access to capital of a further £7 million.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="11102033000341"></a>With respect to credit unions, the legislative reform order contains eight proposals. The first four enable credit unions to extend their membership base and serve a greater number of customers by: opening up the common bond requirements; removing the limit on non-qualifying members; and allowing bodies corporate to become members for the first time subject to a cap. These proposals will allow credit unions to serve a greater number of people by extending the membership base and enabling mergers to take place where this is considered appropriate. The fifth proposal allows credit unions to issue interest-bearing shares, which could encourage increased savings, helping to tackle chronically low rates of saving across the country, and which, in turn, could lead to greater lending.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="11102033000342"></a>The remaining proposals relax restrictions on share withdrawal, allow credit unions to charge an appropriate rate for providing ancillary services and remove the 8 per cent limit on dividends, unless the rules of the credit union provide otherwise. These proposals will substantively update credit union legislation and provide a welcome boost to the mutuals sector and its members. Such is the enthusiasm for these reforms that a recent survey by the Association of British Credit Unions identified that over 60 per cent of credit unions are intending to extend their geographic coverage once the LRO comes into effect.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="11102033000343"></a>As noble Lords are aware, the LRO was previously laid in Parliament in March 2010 and the Committees of both Houses recommended changes to the order prior to its approval. These recommended changes were: first, that the affirmative resolution procedure  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_445"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 445</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be used for any changes to the caps relating to corporate membership; secondly, for members to be required expressly to endorse a decision to abolish the 8 per cent limit on dividends; and thirdly, for the proposal enabling credit unions to charge a market rate for ancillary services to apply only to new members, and to be subject to a review after two years. I am pleased to confirm that each of these recommendations has been taken on board in the new draft order before the House today. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has recommended that the order is,</p>
<ul><a name="11102033000457"></a>"in a form satisfactory to be submitted to the House for affirmative resolution".</ul>
<a name="111020-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="11102033000344"></a>In conclusion, credit unions and co-operatives have been waiting a long time for this LRO to be made and many stand ready to take benefit of the order as soon as it takes effect. This LRO reflects our commitment to promoting the mutual and co-operative sector in Great Britain, ensuring that we enhance diversity in our financial services and that we support a sector that provides finance, employment and support for millions of people, including those hardest to reach and most in need of help. This legislative reform order will support and enable growth of co-operatives and credit unions and I look forward to hearing your Lordships' views on these proposals. I very much hope that you will lend your support to these important reforms. I beg to move.</p>

It celebrates the important economic and social contributions credit unions make to their communities worldwide. I am vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Credit Unions and it is wonderful that we are debating and approving this statutory instrument today of all days.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="11102033000346"></a>As the noble Lord said, credit unions are financial co-operatives owned and controlled by their members. Credit unions in the UK manage over £600 million on behalf of over 900,000 people. The order before us today makes some very welcome changes. It was originally laid in similar form by the last Labour Government, as the noble Lord said, and I was delighted when the present Government sought to carry forward these much needed reforms. The order makes a number of sensible changes, such as allowing credit unions to pay interest on savings rather than a dividend. It allows them to provide services to community groups, attract investments and extend the services that they offer. That is all very welcome. I congratulate the Government on what they have done.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="11102033000347"></a>However, this is only one of a number of steps that the Government should be taking. Although the credit union sector in the UK is growing, it is still relatively small. With the right support, the potential for major expansion is all too evident. That expansion and growth would be of benefit to communities up and down the country. We must also remember that it is a sad fact that some of the most financially excluded citizens have to pay the highest price for credit, which we should all regret and want to work to eliminate. We have seen organisations on the high street that are little more than legal loan sharks which charge people  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_446"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 446</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 per cent interest to borrow money. Expansion of the credit union sector gives people who are financially excluded the opportunity to become financially included and to pay a fair price for the credit that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="11102033000348"></a>The big society seems to have disappeared a bit from the vocabulary of the Government in recent months, but initiatives like this, which enable people to help themselves, are what I understand by the big society and are very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="11102033000349"></a><b><a name="111020-0002.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="11102033000611"></a>Baroness Kramer:</b> My Lords, let me join others in welcoming this order laid before us. Like others, I think that the only regret is that we had not seen it perhaps a little sooner, but I am delighted that it has come now. I am also delighted to be able to look at it in the context of the Government's commitment to credit unions. A project is now under way between the Post Office and ABCUL-a sort of industry spokesperson for credit unions more broadly-to find ways for the Post Office to be the front-door platform for many people to access their accounts through the Post Office structure. That would have been inadequate were these other steps not being taken to expand the capacity of credit unions.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="11102033000350"></a>I am particularly delighted that we now have a new definition of the common bond, which will take a real constraint away from credit unions and their capacity to build membership and to serve the community. The United States has long had much greater flexibility. Whereas in the UK the figures from ABCUL suggest that the current amount of assets under credit union management is £790 million, in the United States-even allowing for the difference in population size-some $900 billion of total assets come within the credit union structure. We are looking at a completely different dimension, which I hope the UK will be able to move towards. As the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, has said, many people who are financially excluded can see a route into financial inclusion through credit unions that they would not find in the high street banks.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="11102033000351"></a>I also am encouraged by the expansion of the groups which a credit union can serve to include corporate bodies, partnerships and unincorporated associations. We have many small businesses which once again cannot find a satisfactory financial relationship through existing high street banks. They need other sources and mechanisms. Again, if we look at the United States, it is interesting that the ability to serve small business has long been part of the credit union framework. In 2011 alone, the Obama Administration are using that credit union network to push $300 million in additional credit directly to small and very small business in a way in which we have no capacity to do here in the UK. For the kind of activity that we are seeing through credit easing-obviously, that is a much broader programme-in the United States that is able to happen far more easily and fluidly through mechanisms such as the credit union and the much wider world of community development banks. We can now begin to move towards having that potential here in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="11102033000352"></a>With the new classes of shares and the ability to deepen investment, we are coming now to the point where there is a recognition that more diversity and provision that focuses on people who are financially

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="11102033000355"></a>As noble Lords have already spoken about the virtues and possibilities of the credit union and the Minister himself paid due tribute to their work, it would be otiose of me to expand on that matter and, as I am given to brevity, noble Lords will appreciate that I will take as read the reason why this order should commend itself to the House. However, I have some questions to ask, which I hope the Minister will be able to respond to. What does he expect the removal of the limit on non-withdrawal shares to be? Will this result in dominant members of a society emerging? What steps will the FSA be taking to ensure that societies do not become subject to such dominance whereby a small number of individuals might establish a very considerable influence with regard to these non-withdrawable share holdings?</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="11102033000356"></a>On credit unions, could I ask about the removal of the common bond, which is the whole point of a credit union, because it provides the self-regulatory strength of mutual knowledge and understanding? What does this mean as far as the future of the credit union is concerned? Does it mean that credit unions will be just another form of financial organisation rather than the distinctive sort of organisation which is being commended in the speeches made so far today in this short debate?</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="11102033000357"></a>Finally, what does the Minister expect to be the impact of bodies corporate joining credit unions? Will this not lead to small commercial enterprises exploiting the financial strength of the credit union to further the interests of their own businesses? In other words, would credit unions become tied to businesses instead of being independent? After all, one business which might supply 10 per cent of the assets of the credit union will undoubtedly be a powerful force within it.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="11102033000358"></a>We welcome this legislation, but I would be grateful if the Minister could give me some assurance on those limited anxieties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="11102033000360"></a>In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, I was waiting to see-my noble friend Lady Kramer having nobly stepped in in the absence of my noble friend Lord Newby-who might be on the Front Bench in the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. I noticed that the noble Lord crossed three Benches in one bound and here he is. It is always good to be opposed by the noble Lord, Lord Davies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="11102033000361"></a>I had not realised that we were debating this order on International Credit Union Day, but I am delighted that we are making a small contribution to that. I should like to have said that we had scheduled the business deliberately, but I must confess that I was unaware.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="11102033000362"></a>As has been said, although the co-operative and credit union sector is not as large in Great Britain as it is in other countries, its membership is growing. That is clear testimony to the trust and esteem in which they are held across the country. The Government want to make sure that we underpin the valuable role that they play, particularly in promoting higher rates of saving across the economy, helping to develop a culture of financial responsibility, providing credit at a local level for individuals and empowering communities across the UK.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="11102033000363"></a>However, I recognise the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, and my noble friend Lady Kramer about the need for us to do more. Even though I was not asked about what else the Government are doing, we see this order in the context of a series of reforms that we are making, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, is aware. We are exploring the commencement aspects of the co-operative Act and this order is a necessary precondition of that Act coming into effect. We are making the electronic communications order for mutuals, which will enable them to cut the costs of communicating and to hold votes electronically. Only earlier this week we debated in Committee the transferring of Northern Ireland credit unions under the FISMA legislation, which will not only act as a deregulatory measure but give better protection to an important category of depositor. Therefore, this order is part of an ongoing programme of work.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="11102033000364"></a>Let me address the important questions of the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham. On the question of non-withdrawable share capital, the consultation and trade body studies indicate that approximately 0.5 per cent of industrial and provident society members will seek to invest more in their co-op. This is viewed as positive. The results do not raise a question of withdrawal but show a small positive interest among members in investing more.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="11102033000365"></a>Then there was the question of whether businesses will effectively take over credit unions. Will credit unions lose their independence? The sector itself wanted businesses to be able to be members and, in that way, help to expand the membership base. No concerns  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_449"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column 449</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were expressed about this during the consultation period. Therefore, this is seen entirely as an opportunity by the sector itself, rather than as any threat to independence.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="11102033000366"></a>In relation, finally, to the common bond and its removal, there is a limit on the extension of the common bond which is currently very restrictive. Some restrictions will remain to ensure that the fundamental purpose of credit unions is not undermined, and that is built into the new construct. I agree with the noble Lord that we must not do anything to undermine the fundamental purpose here. We are not doing so, nor does the sector believe us to be.</p>

<a name="111020-0002.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="11102033000367"></a>When the coalition came into government, we made clear that we would be supportive of the mutuals sector. By means of this legislation, we are taking

It is clear from what I said in my opening remarks, and I think it has been confirmed by contributions this afternoon, that there is huge appetite for growth in this sector. At a time when we must redouble our efforts to support the economy, we have to do all that we can, and this plays a modest but important part in enabling growth. I believe that this order is a win-win situation not only for co-ops and credit unions, but also for the communities that they serve.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000003"></a>A non-dependent adult is likely to be a grown-up son or daughter, still living at home, with his parents on HB. It is assumed that the non-dependent adult will contribute towards the rent, and his parents' HB is reduced accordingly. That is the present system, for those not familiar with it. This amendment would cap that deduction at 50 per cent of the total HB going into the property. Of course, it is sensible that he should contribute but, as the level of his contribution doubles up over the next couple of years to £90 a week, which is at or even in some cases exceeds the level of the entire social rent for the property, this may well exceed the full HB of his parents. So although he is in effect paying the entire rent, he has no legal claim on the property. He, a low-paid worker-otherwise he would probably be in a place of his own-is carrying the full rent bill for his parents in that situation. Not surprisingly, this is currently a source of family tension, which will grow and which affects about 200,000 people, as far as I am aware. In my own local authority in Norwich, 427 council tenant families, 63 housing association and 58 private tenants are currently affected; of those, 100 already have deductions on their HB of over £30 a week as a non-dependent adult, which is set to double. In modest accommodation, that would virtually cover the entire rent being paid for by an adult son, living at home on low earnings.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000004"></a>The Minister may tell us-I do not know, because I am not very good at predicting what he is going to say-that we are only catching up with the freeze of a couple of years ago on NDADs. I accept that this a political point, but can he tell me in that case why it is okay to continue to freeze council tax but not to freeze NDADs along with cutting CTB, which fall on the poorest of us? I think that that is very unfair, and I do not think the Minister can think that that redistribution is right.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000005"></a>I ask your Lordships to think what they would do if they were in the son's place. He can do one or two things. Either he will move out into a more expensive private rented flat of his own, which he may share, if he is under 35; as a low earner, he may be eligible for some HB of his own. That will leave his parents entitled to their HB, so the total HB would therefore  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rise. Or he may decide to stay with his parents but calculate that it is not worth working given the £90 per week penalty out of his take-home pay, which will mean that his MDRs are up in the 80 per cent region. If he moves out, his parents become underoccupying in turn and lose some of their HB, ultimately risking running up arrears and losing their home, whereas if he stays at home and working this will be a sensible and economical use overall of housing space as well as a practical support for them if they need it. If instead he does not move out but drops out of work as he faces punitive MDRs on his low wage, the full HB bill on that house must be paid and two generations of workless family may then be in the same household. Neither of those possibilities seems sensible or desirable, but if you have an economic model of rational behaviour-it is not one that I fully share, but if you do-he is likely to take one of those two routes and to drop out of work or move out of the house: hence this amendment, which suggests that he should contribute to the rent but no more than half of it and that his parents should keep an entitlement to HB but only to half of what it would have been. Its virtues include using the housing space sensibly, keeping the house fully occupied and striking a decent balance between his responsibilities and contribution, that of his parents and that of all of us towards the rent. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000006"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="11102047000347"></a>Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town:</b> I shall also be brief. As my noble friend Lady Hollis has made clear already, the non-dependent adult deductions to housing benefit and council tax benefit are calculated at the moment according to the earnings of the non-dependant or a fixed rate if the non-dependant has no earnings. This amendment seeks to ensure that the amount of housing cost element of the universal credit that is reduced by those deductions cannot be more than 50 per cent of the total cost.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000007"></a>The non-dependent deduction is a sensible one made to a claimant's housing benefit entitlement if they share with a non-dependent adult, who could also be a sibling. It is assumed that non-dependent adults will contribute towards the housing costs, although those of us in this Committee who are parents may know that our offspring do not always pay rent when they continue to live with us. Nevertheless, it is a fair assumption and one that we would not argue with.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000008"></a>There are a number of problems with the non-dependent deductions, however. The housing benefit is reduced by a pre-set amount, regardless of the total rent payable, which can actually leave the non-dependants liable for virtually all the total rent owed, even though, as my noble friend has said, they have no legal claim on the property. The amendment would ensure that the tenants remain responsible for at least half the rent, which we believe would support the Government's ambition to promote financial responsibility. It would also go some way towards addressing many of the problems with high rates of non-dependent deductions, which I do not think any of us would want to see continue, with all the disincentives to work and the tensions within families that it creates and that have already been mentioned. It is a very common-sense amendment, and I look forward to hearing the Minister give his support to it.</p>

The principle is that adults who live in a household of people getting help with housing costs through the benefit system should be expected to make a contribution towards those costs.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000010"></a>Universal credit will provide a streamlined welfare system that makes clear to claimants the financial advantages of taking work or increasing working hours. As part of this clear system, we will define simple rules for the benefit unit and the treatment of income other than earnings which some claimants will have. In many cases, the benefit unit will be the same as the household, but other households could comprise more than one benefit unit. An example would be an older couple with one or more adult children living at home. The older couple would be joint claimants, and the adult child would claim in their own right as a benefit unit. Another example would be two adult siblings sharing a home.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000011"></a>In taking a claim for universal credit, one of the first questions is to establish what the benefit unit for that claim is. We have guiding principles for the rules on the treatment of income. Where claimants have income available, their entitlement to universal credit should be adjusted accordingly to meet some or all of their everyday living costs. The principle that available income reduces entitlement to income-related benefits is long established. However, when support for housing costs is considered, there are currently varying rules on the treatment of income in the welfare system which will be harmonised through the introduction of universal credit. As I have previously explained, we will define in regulations the full list of income types and benefits that must be declared under universal credit in order to be taken into account. The drafting of regulations will aim to provide a more accessible account of the system which claimants and their advisers will find easier to follow.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000012"></a>The existing manner in which we treat non-dependants does not fit with the principles of universal credit, and I am considering how we refine the current rules so that we can bring forward proposals in due course. There are, and always have been, various factors to take into account in the design of the non-dependent deduction scheme: for example, transparency, simplicity, setting the rate of deduction at a fair level, the potential to affect household formation, as well as work incentives and fairness to the tax payer. These factors, as I am sure the noble Baroness will recognise from her time in government, have always meant that non-dependent deductions are a complex issue. We need to look at the treatment of non-dependants along with the treatment of boarders, lodgers and sub-tenants. Furthermore, we need to ensure that there is some sensible fit with the provisions for underoccupancy that we debated earlier this week. We want a scheme that provides incentives for tenant and non-dependants to work and at the same time preserve incentives for households to stay together.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000013"></a>As we are still considering these issues in detail, I urge the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

If I may say so, because I do not want to sound patronising, it is a very intelligent response. It is difficult. We accept that there should be a contribution, but if the contribution doubles in the way projected, the other considerations that the Minister listed, which I entirely share-simplicity, work incentives, house information, occupancy-could be undermined by a progression to a rigorous and inflexible definition of a non-dependent deduction, which would undermine and subvert other equally desirable, and in some cases more important, objectives of the Government. I hope the Minister will continue to keep us briefed on his thinking on that. It would be helpful if he could do that before Report, but it may be too early. I do not know. I realise that this is something that may have to go across departments and into DCLG. I very glad that the Minister recognises the complexity. We are all on the same side on this and want to balance somewhat conflicting objectives here, and it is not an easy choice to make.

These amendments are on shared accommodation. Thanks to the alertness of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, we had a debate last Wednesday on the affirmative regulations. As a result of that, I wondered whether we needed to run this amendment today. I thought it would be useful to do so in Grand Committee, so it is in this format, and we can perhaps revisit some of the arguments that were helpfully elicited by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, in the response by the Minister.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC115"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000016"></a>At the moment-forgive me if I repeat some of the arguments that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, ran on the affirmative regulations, but not everyone was present-young people under 25 get housing benefit that covers the cost of a room in a shared house, student-style, in which there are four of them in a three-bedroom house, one of them occupying the front room, with a common bathroom and kitchen, although, of course, students are not eligible for HB. However, some 80,000 other young people receive HB for such shared rooms: 53,000 under-25s and 36,000 aged between 25 and 35. The Government propose to raise the age range for the shared room rate to 35, so I gather that a further 62,500 who would have received housing benefit for a one-bedroom flat will receive HB for only the single room rent.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000017"></a>To make things worse, the HB for shared room rent will, like that of other property, now reflect only the 30th percentile of room rent rather than the 50th percentile. Demand for very limited stock will double at just the time that the HB to pay for it will be cut to the 30th percentile. Some 20 per cent of existing claimants in one-bedroom benefit-funded property will now get HB only for shared room rent. The average difference in HB in the private-rented sector between those two figures is over £40 a week, but in London it is likely to be over £100 a week. You get £88 if you are on HB for single room rent and £188, on average, if you are in a one-bedroom flat. That is far too high for anyone to make good the shortfall out of their other benefits, even if they sought to do so. In some cases, it would wipe out their entire benefit allocation.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000018"></a>Let me talk about the supply. There are fairly few HMOs around. They form perhaps less than 1 per cent of the country's stock, apart from in Greater London, where they formed 2.3 per cent in 2001. Finding shared accommodation for HB tenants is already difficult as landlords avoid them, preferring students with a university behind them or people in full-time work. With the percentile cuts to HB, even fewer landlords will risk taking them. Certainly in my city, what little shared accommodation of an HMO sort there is is mopped up by students and the rest is of poor quality. With good reason, housing associations and local authorities that are not yet affected by these changes, and I hope never will be, and who have, as we had, bedsitters or HMOs as part of their stock have over the past few years been converting, as I have been doing, two of them into one-bedroom flats for young people precisely because shared rooms provide poor accommodation in terms of space, storage, personal safety and sound insulation for the young, single and often fragile who end up there.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000019"></a>In the past, such property in my housing association has been the source of endless neighbour complaints about noise and anti-social behaviour. Young tenants, especially women, also had a strong aversion to moving into house-sharing with strangers. As a housing association, we have few if any left. You could argue that, until now, those young people under the age of 25 were treated more like students in terms of the accommodation that they were expected to occupy, unsatisfactory though it was. Even then, most housing associations were changing their stock. We have had  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>plenty of evidence over the years that most of them preferred to top-slice their benefit by £10-£20 per week and frankly underpay on their diets to afford something more salubrious than the shared-room rented accommodation on offer.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000020"></a>Now the Government are raising the age threshold so that anyone under 35 will receive only the single room rent. For 62,500 people, that will mean a cut on average of £41 a week and a reduced HB on 30 per cent of a shrinking market. We shall press them into the poorest and least salubrious properties in the market. Although the PRS is growing, as the Social Security Advisory Committee told us on page 19, the amount of shared accommodation has fallen in absolute terms. The price will go up while the quality declines and less and less is available to this group: hence these two amendments.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000021"></a>Amendment 46, with which I start, does not say "no change". It would exempt for one year the situation of someone of, say, 35, who is in work as a secretary, renting a small, one-bedroom flat with no HB. The small firm she works for closes and she loses her job. Under the Government's proposals, when she applied for HB she would be covered for 13 weeks but after that would get only enough to cover a shared room. To stay put, she would have to cover the shortfall herself from JSA. She would soon be in arrears. Having lost her job, she would lose her home. Instead of looking for a new job, I fear that much of her energy would be deflected to looking for a clean, safe room in an HMO. She would feel stressed and possibly fragile.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000022"></a>Were she to share with women friends-people of her choice-she would probably be okay if her HB stretches far enough. As the Minister said in response to the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, maybe she could move to a two-bedroom flat to share with a female friend-if there are such friends floating around currently non-housed-in the hope that their combined housing benefits for SARs will meet the rent. Perhaps they will, but two-bedroom accommodation is in the shortest supply across the whole of the housing field. Landlords already make it clear that they will not let to people on HB except as a last resort. Rents are soaring and HB will cover less and less of it. In practice, three-quarters of those in one-bed accommodation affected will be men.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000023"></a>So what is available and on offer? If the young woman could do what the Minister suggested-the odds on her being able to do so are extremely unlikely, at least for a while-her other option would be to move into an HMO: that is, a house in multiple occupation. Those are usually now occupied by people who have arrived there from some sort of crisis-a relationship breakdown, a row with parents or because they are emerging from institutional life. Few landlords can make an HMO pay without at least three or four tenants, often unknown to each other. The larger the HMO and the greater the profit to the landlord, the greater the problems for all the tenants. A shared tenancy with strangers-they may all be men and she is a woman-will be at best, noisy and intrusive, with late-night parties because they are young and unemployed, loud music and banging doors. The other tenants may perhaps be overfriendly, with chaotic lifestyles, casual  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC117"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about helping themselves to anything that she puts in the fridge, and careless about keeping the shared kitchen or bathroom clean. That is at best.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000024"></a>I know that, at worst, often the older men in HMOs are ex-offenders with a history of violence, people with poor mental health, aggressive men with anger management problems who never hold down a tenancy for more than a few months, or current drug users whose various associates move in and out of the property-with numerous, multiple keys in circulation. There will be dirty common parts, stained lavatories, never-cleaned baths, an open front door and only a thin, plywood door to her room to keep her safe. She has had to find somewhere clean and decorate if she can, move her things, get rid of most of her furniture for lack of space, sort out utilities, notify her change of address-all the clutter that impedes her job search, which should be her priority-as well as find desperately needed cash for agency fees, a month's deposit a month in advance, compulsory contents insurance, and fees for a credit search at £125 a time. The cost may be £500, or £1,000, and she has just lost her job. Having found a room, somewhere away from where she lived and worked, she is no longer meeting friends at lunchtime to gossip about job vacancies and the like, even though we know that 80 per cent of all job vacancies go not through Jobcentre Plus but through networks.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000025"></a>In practice, we have sharply increased her likelihood of not finding a job and of staying unemployed. Yet we know that 90 per cent of all people on JSA who have lost their job get back to work within nine months or so, and almost never because of Jobcentre Plus. They do not need to be chivvied; they are desperate to find another job, and they will do so. In that case, the young woman will come off HB and hopefully all will be well, and again she will move-not back to her old flat, because that has gone, but to yet another flat, with all the associated costs and disruptions: the search again for affordable furniture such as curtains and kitchen equipment, a month's deposit a month in advance, and another agency fee. All that could be another £1,000. She has had to pay for two moves in the space of nine months, which has wiped out her savings, strained her health and made it much harder for her to find a job. She has been put through the ringer for no point at all. We have made it harder for her and delayed her re-entry into work, instead of supporting her. Stats and the Social Security Advisory Committee show that two-thirds of all HB claims for one-bedroom flats last for one year or less, because the claimants get back into work. We are impeding this young woman in making that sensible move.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000026"></a>This amendment, very simply, gives the young woman a breathing space of a year, during which she receives HB for a one-bedroom flat. Hopefully within the year she will be back in work and will need no HB at all, and we will have avoided rather a lot of distress and misery, avoided wiping out her savings in forced moves as we compound her problems for no point at all. If however, after a year-I am mindful of the expenditure implications-she is still dependent on HB, she can consider her options and will have had time to find the safer, more attractive option which the noble Lord  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>outlined in response to the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, of sharing a two-bedroom flat with someone she has got to know, rather than resorting to unsafe and insalubrious HMOs amid strangers. The Government will get their benefit savings over time from long-term stayers on HB, but they do not need to send this fragile woman, who has lost her job, to the rock bottom of the housing ladder as well.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000027"></a>Amendment 45 deals with exemptions. The previous amendment was to give someone who was previously in work and has lost their job a breathing space so that they can concentrate on seeking work rather than go through the revolving doors of changing homes and moving to an HMO. This amendment seeks equally to prevent people who are already on benefit and who for one reason or another are especially fragile from going into HMOs. Some of these groups of people are so obvious that they hardly need to be spelt out, and perhaps the Minister will be able to reassure us on this: disabled people; care leavers; those who might be a danger to others, including, I fear, in some cases, substance abusers or those with a fairly severe mental health problem; and people with learning difficulties, who may be financially exploited by other tenants. Some of the most heart-wrenching stories from housing associations that I have come across are about people with learning difficulties being exploited in an HMO.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000028"></a>We might, for example, hope that a young ex-offender will go straight or a recovering addict will stay clean, or be talking about a young person with a dysfunctional family background who is coming out of care and trying to be independent. The last thing they need is to go to an HMO, where they might be surrounded by the chaotic, the insecure, the petty criminal, or those who sometimes have abusive lifestyles from which their problems emerged in the first place.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000029"></a>One young man coming off drugs had two options of an HMO available-one with five ex-users, or one with two who had just started again. He was asked which he preferred. Such HMOs increase the risk of recidivism. Landlords certainly do not want such tenants, and often only the worst landlords with the poorest accommodation will take them. I hope that others of your Lordships will speak to their knowledge of particular client groups and the unstable, chaotic housing biographies that will result from the Government's proposals.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000030"></a>I shall now spend a moment on two groups in particular: women at risk of domestic violence, and non-resident parents. I should declare an interest as I set up a refuge back in the 1970s for what we then called battered wives. Let us say that he and she share a one-bedroom flat; they are both around 30 and on HB. He knocks her around but tells her that if she gets him excluded from the flat she will lose it and be forced into an HMO. At the HMO she could expect to be with strangers and men with alcohol or substance abuse issues or with anger management issues, and men who have been excluded from the marital home also because of domestic violence. Already frightened, she will be terrified. She will have little or no protection if he has stalked and followed her there, as some more predatory partners do.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000031"></a>The other group involves non-resident parents-usually men. This is perhaps a less obvious group. We know  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the best predictor of a girl child in a lone-parent family making a good life, who stays on at school, passes her exams and does not become pregnant is if her mother works and raises her aspirations. UC will really help in this and I hope that it will transform her life. We also know that what matters to a boy child-so that he does not truant or get into trouble with the law, he stays on at school and does not lock horns with a stepfather-if he is excluded from the home and in time finds a job is if he is in regular contact with his natural father. A stepfather is six times more likely to harm a child than a natural father, so such contact is a crucial form of safety, especially for the boy child. It is only possible if the non-resident parent-nearly always a man-has a safe home for that child to stay for the weekend.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000032"></a>Even if the HMO is salubrious, safe, clean and comfortable, which is, frankly, unlikely, a father could not decently have his 12 year-old daughter sleeping in the same single room as he does. If the HMO is less than safe and salubrious, his son will not want to stay over either. Indeed, the father may not want to bring any children into an HMO that is dirty and where there is drug use and petty criminality. A mother would not let either of them visit and stay, and in those circumstances the child will probably not want to. York University did a study with Crisis and reported that,</p>
<ul><a name="11102047000325"></a>"men with children who go into bedsits will lose contact with their children ... most of our clients have been abandoned by one parent, so the cycle will continue".</ul>
<p><a name="11102047000293"></a>We know that after two years half of all men have lost contact with their children, partly because of accommodation reasons.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000033"></a>Two things flow from that. If he is paying maintenance he may well say, "If I don't have contact I am not paying". We are then into the desperate roundabout of CMEC pressures and prosecution. The children, especially boy children, who I am most worried about, lose the opportunity of having their natural father in their life. We know that half of all fathers lose contact within two years. This measure will increase their number and the lack of contact. The father must have a one-bedroom flat so it is safe for the child to stay.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000034"></a>When I was chair of housing in Norwich, I used to offer two-bedroom flats if possible, but if not always a one-bedroom flat, to men in such circumstances when they broke up with their partner. It meant that parents did not then war over who should have the tenancy of the marital home and the children moved freely and happily between the two. There was shared parenting and shared residency. Civilised relationships between the couples were more likely to be maintained when they were not fighting over access to the children as a way of getting access to a home. A one-bedroom flat would suffice but a room in a shared house not at all. I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord will help with these amendments.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000035"></a>The amendments ask, first, for an exemption for one year for those who have lost their job and coming on to HB for the first time; and, secondly, to take into account the particular circumstances of those who are vulnerable and will continue to be so in HMOs. The groups on which I have focused are women coming

That is how maintenance flows. If we undermine contact through our housing legislation, we will undermine payment, which the CMEC is trying to achieve. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000036"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="11102047000352"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> My Lords, the Committee owes the noble Baroness a debt. These amendments are entirely appropriate and I support them. She has built intelligently upon the debate that we had on 12 October. That is also valuable as it gives us a twin approach to the Government's reaction to these important issues.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000037"></a>As the noble Baroness said, we are dealing with a relatively small group of 62,000 or 63,000 people, but they are extremely vulnerable to being prejudiced against by up to £41 a week, which is an enormous sum of money to lose in their circumstances. These two facts in themselves require us to spend some time asking the Government to reflect carefully on how we take this whole thing forward.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000038"></a>I was struck in the Chamber debate of 12 October by the extent to which a lot of expert opinion was deeply concerned about this. There was a York University report, a Crisis survey, the Merits Committee report and, of course, the Social Security Advisory Committee review that the Government received. They all in their different ways picked up on points that the noble Baroness has made, and expressed concern. We should weigh that in the balance as well.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000039"></a>I support these amendments. I am not going to speak for very long, but I will make two points. First, on the spatial incidence of the effect of this measure, the suggestions of the Minister, who gave a full reply in the debate of 12 October, were predicated upon an urban-in fact, a London-based, south-east-context that bears no relationship to Selkirkshire where I live. I do not know what further detailed work has been done as part of the impact statement on the spatial dimension of the client group of 63,000 that we are dealing with, but I would certainly be concerned that those who were left in disparate communities in the United Kingdom would be put in a very invidious position indeed. The Government may be correct in cosmopolitan and busy environments such as the capital city and major cities, but the prospect is entirely different in rural areas.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000040"></a>Secondly, I have a point to make, which the noble Baroness has correctly made on a number of occasions, and it would be helpful to get a considered reflection on it in the course of the Committee. Discretionary housing payments are the answer that the Government properly put forward in many of these interlocking housing issues. We are dealing not merely with shared accommodation and rent; discretionary housing payments are expected to carry the weight of a whole lot of, perhaps unintended, consequences for some of these housing changes.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000041"></a>When the Minister responded on 12 October, I was slightly surprised by two of his sentences. He was talking about the Merits Committee conclusion that  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC121"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>discretionary housing payments were a temporary solution in their view, but he said that there is no limit on how long they are paid for. He went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11102047000305"></a>"We review the allocation of DHPs to local authorities annually and will continue to do so".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/10/11; col. GC467.]</p>

<p><a name="11102047000294"></a>We know that discretionary housing payments have been increased to £190 million over the period of the comprehensive spending review. Can we learn a little more about what guidance has been given to local authorities and how the allocation of that money will come? Does it begin to be adequate? Some of us in the Committee are concerned about the quantum of money that is being clawed back from the housing budget over the period of time that the deficit reduction is being applied. You might well mitigate a lot of that by discretionary housing payments if they were intelligently applied, if the guidance was clear and if the finance was adequate, but certainly some of us are beginning to wonder how far £190 million will go in dealing with all these things at the same time. Perhaps the Minister could give us some reassurance, if not now then in the course of Committee and later stages, on this basic question: if it is discovered that £190 million does not meet the task, given the load it is expected to carry, is there an expectation that the Government will look at it again and increase that amount of money? I think it is inevitable that they will have to do so, although this is a guess based on the complexity of the situation we are finding and the number of changes and cuts that the discretionary payments have to make up. I always believed that discretionary housing payments were temporary and in this I agree with the Merits Committee, although the Minister seems not to. If I am wrong and there is some misunderstanding, it would be helpful if he could clear that up.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000042"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="11102047000353"></a>Baroness Lister of Burtersett:</b> My Lords, I, too, took part in the debate last week and I will not repeat everything that I said then, particularly about some of the implications for women. My noble friend Baroness Hollis has spoken so eloquently today that I do not need to repeat it. I was particularly struck in the debate last week by the contribution by the noble Baroness, Lady Browning, who talked about people on the autistic spectrum. She spoke very movingly and quoted from a letter that someone had sent to her about what it means for someone on the autistic spectrum who is told they will have to share with people they do not know. What is it going to be like for that person and for the other people in the accommodation? How tolerant will they be of what will be perceived as rather odd and difficult behaviour? I remember my flat-sharing days, and it would have been a nightmare to share a flat with a stranger who was difficult.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000043"></a>The noble Baroness made the point that this is not simply about the amount of discretionary housing payment, although I will say a little about that in a moment. In the letter that she quoted from, the mother of a 32 year-old man on the autistic spectrum in this situation describes the anxiety of not knowing whether he will get help through the discretionary housing payment. This is a question simply about the amount;  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC122"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because it is discretionary there is no right to the payment, and someone on the autistic spectrum needs certainty. They are incredibly anxious as to what is going to happen.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000044"></a>The Minister did not really address this in his response last week. I was also frankly quite shocked by the harshness of his response on the question of non-resident parents. Perhaps I can read back to the Minister what he said. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11102047000306"></a>"Parents living in hostels or other non-mainstream accommodation will, I am sure, be striving to maintain quality relationships with their children".</p>

<p><a name="11102047000295"></a>Of course they will. He continued:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11102047000307"></a>"Ultimately, it is for individual maintenance and custody arrangements to reflect living arrangements, and it is not appropriate for the state to fund two homes for a child".</p>

<p><a name="11102047000296"></a>He also said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11102047000308"></a>"But living in shared accommodation should not preclude both parents from playing a full part in a child's life".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/10/11; col. GC466.]</p>

<p><a name="11102047000297"></a>We should think of the reality of this and what it must be like if you are living with strangers. Shared parenting is often very fraught anyway; the Government want to encourage shared parenting, but surely this discourages it. I was very disappointed with that response last week.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000045"></a>I come back to the point made by my noble friend-or rather the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood; I think of him as a noble friend sometimes-about the amount. This will probably be a running gag of this Committee. Discretionary payments have become the loaves and fishes of the housing benefit world, and even our Lord would have had limits on how far he could stretch those loaves and fishes.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000046"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="11102047000354"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, for tabling these amendments to ensure that we thoroughly think through the impact of this legislation on the various vulnerable groups that it will hit.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000047"></a>I have three points. The first is about fathers and contact with their children. It was very encouraging on Monday to hear the Minister of State for Children and Families launch new parenting programmes and preface this new parenting support by saying that the single most important aspect for improving children's outcomes in education is the home environment; it is what happens at home with parents that matters. It made me think of my own experience with my father, and the fact that the biggest contribution that he made to my education was that he read to us; we used to sit and read books together with him, and we always used to see him reading. It is very important that we enable parents to keep in touch with their children. Some recent research sent to me highlighted the important impact that fathers have on their daughters' education. It was perhaps surprising to see that at certain stages of their daughters' lives the interest of the father in his daughters' education has a bigger impact on their performance in school than it does on that of their sons. At a certain age there is a bigger difference. So it is so important to get this right. That leads me to reflect again on a concern that concerns many others-about how far the Government are thinking across  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>different departments on how we are going to make a difference to children and families in other areas  of policy.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000048"></a>My second point is about houses in multiple occupation. I was reminded of a visit that I made some time ago with a health visitor to a young mother in a house in multiple occupation in Walthamstow. The mother had an eight week-old baby. She was African by origin. The father was not interested in her or the child and had no family about her; she was isolated, and she was crying as we met with her. Her only support was the local church group, which would visit her. When we came to visit her, the front door was open. That is an example of what the noble Baroness was talking about-the lack of safety in such houses in multiple occupation. She was sharing a kitchen and bathroom with five other households in that setting. Then there was an 18 year-old woman in a Centrepoint hostel with whom I spoke some years ago and who described her experience of sharing inadequate accommodation with a number of others, including men. She felt very insecure, as there was not a proper lock on her door or there was not a lock at all, and she worried about that. Those are important concerns to bear in mind, particularly with pregnant mothers, who should not feel pushed to go into HMOs.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000049"></a>Finally, there may be protection for care leavers up to the age of 21 from being hit by the shared room rate, but the issue has always been raised with me as a concern. For many of them, issues will still arise beyond the age of 21, so I would like to have further information about how we might protect them better than they are already protected. What particularly comes to mind is that it might be particularly difficult for a young woman who has been abused in her childhood by a member of the opposite sex to share with men. But I would need to think more about how it actually works in practice and what the particular concerns are.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000050"></a>Again, I thank the noble Baroness for tabling these important amendments, and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

I was much more persuaded by the Minister's speech on that occasion than others seem to have been. I thought that he made some very good arguments for what we are doing here, although I still have some concerns. Let us not forget that we are trying to find savings of £200 million here, and that has to be taken into account. What is the priority? I would much rather that we spent money on dealing with the problems that we were discussing the day before yesterday, on the underoccupation issue, than thinking that we can just ignore this change. If we are going to improve on where we are with this legislation, we must be very fine-tuned in what we are trying to do.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000052"></a>Everyone accepts that it is not right that people not in work should have separate accommodation when people in work cannot afford it. A quite convincing  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC124"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>statistic-if it is true and I assume that it is-is that, in 60 per cent of the locality, two-bedroom local housing allowance rate is less than twice the shared rate. We have to accept that in these times we should be trying to encourage children to stay longer in their homes. When times are hard that is inevitable. It is happening in the private sector because people cannot take on mortgages. It also has to be accepted in this sector as well. There have to be some economies and that is an obvious one. Anyway, a very high proportion of people in this age group-some 40 per cent-are already sharing. We have to recognise that that happens.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000053"></a>The Government have tried to make a number of exceptions. It should also be said that not all shared accommodation is bad. Some people benefit from it, particularly the lonely and some of the vulnerable people that we have talked about today. The trouble is that there is not enough of it and it could be improved. The Government have also set aside extra money for the discretionary grants. I know that there are various concerns about those grants but how do you define that? How do you get the fine-tuning? In any event, somebody will have to assess the people with these difficulties. Obviously, they can be helped by that route. Everybody was very moved by the comments of my noble friend Lady Browning on autistic people. We would all share that. Somebody has got to assess those people. There will never be any certainty until they are assessed in the situation.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000054"></a>We have to accept that we are into fine-tuning this legislation. I will say four things. First, we need to look at pregnant women as a group. When I went to midwifery classes with my wife, I was always told that you do not have a baby, move home and start a new job all at the same time. I have always passed that lesson on to other people. It is a lesson that we need to look at carefully in this case. We do not want women having to move twice, when they become pregnant and then before the birth or just after it.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000055"></a>A second problem needs looking at. The Minister said in his speech that the market is not static. I agree with that. Looking at the statistics, the rental market has moved quite a lot in the last five years, in all sorts of ways. Yet there is the severe problem of shared accommodation. If we increase the pressure from the 25 to 35s in this market, we will make it more difficult for the under-25s to get accommodation where they most need it. The Government have to look at this area and make it a priority.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000056"></a>I have two other points. In certain areas, we  have already heard the issues of London and the south-east but it is rural areas in particular that will have a problem because there is simply no shared accommodation. Extra helps needs to be made available through the discretionary grant and we need to look at providing more accommodation. I say again that this is an area where we are inevitably looking for important savings. We may not want to do that but we have to, so we have to be sharper in pinpointing the real priorities in this area.</p>

The noble Baroness said that someone could be considered vulnerable as a result of mental illness but somebody has to define that. If you put these regulations in, you must have the groups more and more defined. The Government have tried to look at areas where they could define them. Otherwise they have to rely on the discretionary grants.</p>

I take his point about having to save money. I am certainly not against sharing in itself for this age range. However, for vulnerable groups it is very much more difficult. In some areas of the country, it will be very hard.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000060"></a>We have heard a bit about the situations in rural Norfolk, Selkirkshire and London. I have some up-to-date figures on properties to rent in Winchester, where a lot of claimants are being advised to move to Eastleigh or Southampton due to the scarcity of property to rent in Winchester, because people simply are not moving  at the moment. Historically there have been between 110 and 150 properties available to rent in Winchester. Last week there were 83, six of which were affordable to people in receipt of local housing allowance. The cheapest two-bed was £75 above the LHA level;  the cheapest four-bed was £50 above it. That puts the matter into a bit of context for the moment and is why a lot of us are very concerned about this policy kicking in while the economic situation is so dire and people are not moving.</p>

To add to what the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, has just said, I live in Durham and, while there is a lot of shared accommodation available in Durham city, it is all taken by students. The demand for that is such that it drives the price up. It is difficult to imagine how someone in those circumstances could compete in that market. If they are driven out into County Durham, it is hard to find the kind of accommodation that is described, so I can add to the geographical Cook's tour of bits of London where we think the Minister's intentions, even if one were to agree with them, might be a little hard to implement.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000062"></a>On one or two other categories, I read in the <I>Telegraph</I> on a rare occasion in June this year a comparison of runaway dads and drink drivers as people beyond the pale: they need the message rammed home to them,</p>
<ul><a name="11102047000326"></a>"from every part of our culture, that what they are doing is wrong ... All this will help make a difference. But in the end, it will be the daily habits and decisions of Britain's fathers that will determine if we succeed. On their decision to financially and emotionally support their child even if they've split up from their mother; to spend time with their kids at weekends, taking them to the football or the playground".</ul>
<p><a name="11102047000298"></a>It goes on. I am sure that the Minister has recognised the quote, from the Prime Minister, Mr Cameron. Consider for a moment how easy it would be for a father who had just split up from the mother of his child or children, possibly even because he had lost his job-we all know the research into the impact of  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>financial difficulties in causing relationship and family breakdown-who finds himself in a position where he has to go and live in a room in shared accommodation, if he can find one. It may be that there is none nearby, and he is encouraged, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, described, to move some distance away. How then can he afford to come to visit his children when he finds himself on benefits? It may be that other people sharing the house will not be people who make him feel safe bringing his children into it. He can certainly take them to play football in the park in the summer, but there is a little nip in the air even now in October, and I am not sure that we could expect him to do that come December. So where is he to have this contact with the children? Very often-as we know, too often, especially in the early days-relationships can be quite difficult after they have broken down. To expect the parents to be in the house where the children are living is not always that easy.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000063"></a>I would be interested in the Minister's view when we look at the question of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission. That same father may find himself paying more money towards child maintenance. If he regains a job, be will be paying a lot more of that, or else less money will end up with the mother of his children. What would the Minister like to see? What would be a good result for this? How will he help those non-resident parents to maintain contact?</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000064"></a>Is the Minister aware of any evidence about whether or not contact in the early years with the non-resident parent makes any difference to the likelihood of their paying child maintenance? He ought to be in a position to know, and I would be very interested; he might write to me if he does not.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000065"></a>I have two other issues. First, on the position of people who have different kinds of mental illness, which has been mentioned, I do not want to go into detail but I add my voice in support of that. We must all have met people who we can see would find that kind of enforced contact extremely difficult. I urge the Minister to think hard on that.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000066"></a>Secondly, my final word is about the position of pregnant women. I lived in shared accommodation when I was young; I suspect that a number of us have. I have spoken to friends of mine who have done it as well.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000067"></a>Perhaps the Minister knows people who have done so, but could he for a moment imagine what it is like to be a young woman, lying in bed at night, wanting to use the lavatory but trying to work out if she can wait until the morning because she can hear the noise outside in the shared area and she knows that she will have to walk past these men, who have come home drunk, in order to get to the lavatory? I know this sounds as if I am being over-dramatic but I am aware of that happening in, frankly, not-too-bad accommodation in parts of London. It does not happen only in small, unusual, mythical kinds of poor accommodation. If someone is given little choice in a market which, as we have all heard, is going to be much more competitive, they do not have a lot of room for manoeuvre. If that young woman-she could even be a 30 or 34 year-old woman-is pregnant, what is she to do?</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000068"></a>Also imagine for a moment that she is in a job, finds she is pregnant and then either loses her job or gives it up. Is she going to move house in the circumstances that were described so eloquently a moment ago? Are we really expecting her to bring a baby back to that shared house? I am sure the Minister does not mean this.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000069"></a>If the discretionary payments are to cover all of these groups, has the Minister done any costing as to which of these groups should automatically be covered and can he tell us how far it will go? We may be wrong. It may be that, when the sums are done carefully, it is enough to cover all of these exemptions and the others that have been considered and that the amount will be admirable. Will he agree to come back to the Committee with information on that to put our minds at rest?</p>

<p><a name="11102047000070"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="11102047000360"></a>Lord McAvoy:</b> My Lords, this could be a repeat of a previous debate. I am not going to say anything about Amendment 46 because I think that would only take away from the passionate and informative speech of my noble friend Lady Hollis of Heigham.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000071"></a>However, in regard to Amendment 45, I was a councillor on Strathclyde Regional Council and chairman of a sub-committee dealing with urban deprivation which dealt with organisations that provided services for many of the people on the list outlined in Amendment 45. My noble friend has outlined clearly what life is like in that strata of society. I do not have any figures but it seems to me that, collectively, Governments have failed to reduce the number of people in these categories. I accept that it is a reflection on all of us that it is still going on and that the cycle is still there.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000072"></a>The stories that we heard and the environment and accommodation that we saw on visits to organisations and centres dealing with many of the groups of people were, quite frankly, horrible. Many of our colleagues here can give examples of that. My noble friend Lady Sherlock mentioned pregnant women; I have particular knowledge of someone suffering from mental illness who was trying to get out of single accommodation. What happens is that people move into accommodation but, because of their behaviour-which is not their fault-they make life unbearable and uncomfortable for their fellow people sharing the house and eventually they get eased out. They get eased out time and again and descend into the lower, rougher types of accommodation. They end up with each other and it is a very unhappy situation. I really feel for the people there. This is only anecdotal but I do not see any reduction. The committee I was on covered the City of Glasgow and I do not see any great reduction in the number of people involved in these categories.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000073"></a>I do not want to bring a discordant note into these deliberations because there are so many skilled and knowledgeable people here. However, I will make  a comment without taking on too much. There is a continual theme coming from our Liberal colleagues of "Woe is me. It is terrible what we are doing to people but the national deficit requires it". I see Liberal colleagues and friends on the Liberal Benches twisting and turning to justify their position on this type of cut and this way of treating people. It is a comparatively small group of people whom we are focusing on.

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000074"></a>This is a small group of people in comparative terms. The Liberals are giving some kind of cover to the hardliners in the Government who are focusing on very vulnerable people. It is a reflection on us all. The noble Lord, Lord Stoneham of Droxford, seemed to be creating a group of people who should be ostracised from society and picked on, who are somehow different from the rest of society. I do not think that it was deliberate, but it shows what happens when you try to twist and turn to justify one's position. I do not agree that we should say, "Well, these people deserve it-there are cuts coming, so this group of people should get it". There is an overemphasis on this group of people, and the £200 million. We are going to have a discretionary fund, but we have had hardly any information from the Government about it, so I would like to hear from the Minister. Despite my previous comments, I do not think that he is a bad man. But then again, it is going to be a long Committee stage and I reserve my position. I would like to hear how he sees these groups being catered for under these proposals.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000075"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="11102047000361"></a>Baroness Campbell of Surbiton:</b> My Lords, I would also like to support the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on these two important amendments. In the last debate, I was concerned about the vulnerability of people with mental health impairment and their housing needs. Although I am partially satisfied that the Minister is confident about the discretionary payments, I guess that I am not so confident.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000076"></a>My question is on a small example. I am extremely worried about people with obsessive compulsive disorder. Shared accommodation can be excruciating for this group of people, so much so that they will not leave their room. So how will they go to the bathroom, without that trust? How will they go down the corridor, not knowing whom they will meet and what will happen? It is an impairment that is very much predicated on the situation and not the physicality.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000077"></a>Disabled people are not vulnerable people; they become vulnerable when they are in vulnerable situations. If this Room dropped in temperature-frankly, if it became any colder than it is now-I would be very vulnerable to hypothermia, but I am not a vulnerable person. It strikes me that we are not again looking through the prism of the social model of disability, which says very clearly that disability becomes exacerbated and that you become a disabled person when your environment and the attitudes around you do not enhance your physicality. It strikes me that relying on discretion is too dangerous for particular groups of disabled people, and certainly when it comes to people with obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para61"></a>

Guess which of those groups gets the worst treatment: people with obsessive compulsive disorder do, because we laugh at them. We think that it is a joke. We have all seen that film, "As Good as It Gets". That man was laughed at, but we should remember that he lived as if he was in prison until he had the confidence to leave his own home.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000079"></a>Will the Minister assure me again about the discretionary payment, because I do not have his confidence?</p>

<p><a name="11102047000080"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="11102047000362"></a>Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town:</b> My Lords, we have learnt some interesting things in this debate. First, the Minister is not a bad man; secondly, my noble friend Lord McAvoy is not a social liberal; and, thirdly, some of us have had some interesting shared accommodation in our past, although most of us were rather under 25, let alone 35, at the time.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000081"></a>The shared accommodation rate, which is a lower rate of housing benefit, applies to single tenants under 25. The Government intend to extend that to people up  to the age of 35. The estimate is 60,000 and we have to agree that they are somewhat vulnerable people. Assuming that there is no transitional relief, as from January the average loss will be £41 a week, or in London up to £100 a week. None of us doubts that that will mean that most of the 25 to 35 year-olds will lose their current homes.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000082"></a>Crisis, which I still think of as Crisis at Christmas-that shows my age, I guess-has already found a shortage of shared accommodation as the market simply cannot respond that rapidly to these changes, which will come in over a very short time. There is a real risk that some of those affected will become homeless, especially, as we have heard, in rural areas or, indeed, in Winchester, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, have already described. It would be interesting to hear the DWP's own estimates or of any action being taken to promote the availability of appropriate accommodation within that timescale.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000083"></a>As Crisis has said, and as many noble Lords have voiced, sharing can be difficult and even dangerous. It can have serious impacts on vulnerable people, hence our concern about the proposed extension from 25 to 35 years of age. The existing exemptions, which are set out in secondary legislation, are for severely disabled people, care leavers aged under 22, those who are aged 25 or over who have spent more than three months in a homelessness hostel and received resettlement support, and those aged 25 or over who are considered a risk to others-not those at risk, but a risk to others. Those exemptions, announced in July, are undoubtedly welcome and indicate that the Government recognise that sharing can be inappropriate for some sorts of vulnerable groups.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000084"></a>As we have heard, the Government have made the case that discretionary housing payments could be used to protect vulnerable people, but as both the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, and my noble friend Lady Lister have said, it lacks certainty. My noble friend also referred to the amounts-I was going to use the word insignificant, but she spoke of loaves and fishes, which is a better description of how often those  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC130"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>discretionary housing payments will be used. The total pot is only £190 million over four years. This is intended to help those who currently have a shortfall as well as those affected by all the cuts to housing benefit. I think the Budget made £1.8 billion-worth of cuts to housing benefit, in addition to the £215 million proposed to be saved from changes to the shared accommodation rate. I argue that the discretionary housing payment will not suffice. We will therefore  be interested to hear whether further exemptions will be considered.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000085"></a>I would like to highlight four of the exemptions that have already been mentioned. First, there are pregnant women, but that exemption has probably been well enough described, and I think is even accepted by the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, which must be a special tick for it. Secondly, there are those who have been victims of abuse or are at risk of violence or fear violence. The fear of someone they have been living with makes a locked door and a completely safe environment a priority for those people, who are mostly women.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000086"></a>Thirdly, there are those who are vulnerable because of previous rough sleeping or drug or alcohol dependency, and I declare an interest as a trustee of CASA, a service for alcohol misusers. As our clients move out of treatment or of previous unsuitable accommodation and learn to live with a new sobriety, it is hard to emphasise the challenges of sharing a home with someone who continues to drink. I do not necessarily mean to drink heavily, but even to drink socially. It is very hard to describe how once you have given up alcohol what the smell of a thrown-away bottle of beer or wine, let alone just having drink available at the time that you are trying to maintain sobriety, can mean. It is a real challenge.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000087"></a>Fourthly, there are non-resident parents, who have been well described already, whose relationship with their children could be adversely affected by this. We are talking about an older age group who are much more likely to have children than the under-25s. I think that 18 per cent of the 25 to 34 age group on single homeless benefits who do not have dependent children are absent parents. That is a high proportion. As has been stressed, a safe place to host one's own children is key to that relationship. As my noble friend Lady Sherlock said, you cannot be outside all day, especially with very young children. Cooking and sharing food with your children is an important part of being a family community.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000088"></a>Other changes in this Bill will already worsen the existing shortage of one-bedroom flats that we have discussed on other days. This change could have a similar effect on the shortage of shared accommodation as it will in effect double the number seeking this stock. We know what that will do to prices. There is not enough of this sort of accommodation available, and the market takes time to respond, especially when the banks are so loath at the moment to make loans, yet investment is needed to create flats of that sort  or to improve and adapt housing in this way. As  the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, said, this increase to 35 year-olds will increase the pressure on the under 25 year-olds who are seeking that sort of accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000089"></a>As my noble friend Lady Hollis has set out, Amendment 46 seeks to protect those who were renting non-shared accommodation either out of their own resources or when in work. It is to prevent them being evicted because of their housing benefit being cut to cover only shared accommodation and to protect them for 12 months. It would prevent all that unnecessary upheaval for those who might be out of work for quite a short period of time by preventing them having to move from sole occupancy to shared accommodation. Losing a job and a house at the same time creates enormous stress levels that will not help someone focus on stabilising their job search. They will be spending their time looking for a new home. I think it was the report by the noble Lord, Lord Freud, for the DWP that showed that around half JSA claimants find work within three months, so we are talking about a lot of people being able to find work fairly quickly, and it would be dreadful to move them for a short period.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000090"></a>Amendment 46 would prevent the half who are likely to find a job from suffering needless upheaval in having to move. It would give them a breathing space, in the words of my noble friend Lady Hollis.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000091"></a>I should like to say a word in response to the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham. It would be a false saving if cuts in this part of the benefit then appeared as a greater expenditure in other parts when further resettlements, A&amp;E or other things would be necessary. So, in order to help quite a small group of vulnerable people, in the words of my noble friend Lord McAvoy, we support the approach of these two amendments and we hope very much that the Minister will respond sympathetically to them.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000092"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="11102047000363"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, the change to the shared accommodation rate was comprehensively debated last Wednesday, 12 October, following the take note Motion raised by my noble friend Lord Kirkwood. Many of the noble Lords present today also attended and participated in that debate. The issues raised and my responses are therefore a matter of public record, so I do not propose to cover the same ground again today.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000093"></a>For those not present last week, the main points I made are that sharing is commonplace in this age group and it is only right that claimants make similar choices to those not on benefit. The increase to age 35 will save around £200 million by 2013. Exemptions are available for those in vulnerable situations and we have introduced two more for the new age group. We do not yet know how claimants will react to this change, whether they will stay where they are, move into shared accommodation or move in with family or friends. A comprehensive evaluation on the April 2011 local housing allowance changes will also look at the effect of the shared accommodation rate. I can clarify for the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, that the earliest that new claimants will start to be affected will be January next year. For those making new claims for housing benefit and for customers claiming from April 2011, the change will take place from the anniversary of their claim, if there are no changes of circumstance.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000094"></a>I would like to take Amendment 46 first. This provides for a 52-week exemption from the use of the shared accommodation rate when working out the  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC132"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>housing element within universal credit for those single and aged under 35. There is already a 13-week exemption from rent restrictions that applies to those who could afford their rent when they first took on that commitment. Most claims for housing benefit are short. It protects a person's ability to pay their rent during that time. That in effect picks up the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, and the example that she used for that period. Indeed, half of jobseeker's allowance claimants in the 18 to 24 age bracket have been claiming for less than 13 weeks and fewer than 5 per cent have been claiming for over 52 weeks. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, is right in quoting my research from some time ago. Fundamentally, those statistics have not changed. This amendment would erode a significant proportion of the savings expected from the extension of the shared accommodation rate age threshold and would generate new costs through increased entitlement for some claimants aged under 25.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000095"></a>Amendment 45 provides for a series of pre-existing and further exemptions from the shared accommodation rate within universal credit. The proposed new exemptions would substantially increase the number of younger people who could have benefit paid for self-contained properties. I remind noble Lords that we are already providing two further exemptions when the increased age threshold from age 25 to 35 comes into force. These exemptions are for certain ex-offenders who pose a risk to the public and certain former residents of specialist homeless hostels who have been supported back into living in the community. To pick up the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on women in particular fleeing from domestic violence, the definition of a homeless hostel may include a domestic violence refuge or drug rehabilitation hostel, so in practice additional groups may very well benefit from this particular exemption. We believe that the numbers involved are small, as the shared accommodation rate applies, of course, exclusively to people without children.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000096"></a>We looked carefully at the arguments for exempting other specific groups, including people with disabilities, mental health problems and a history of substance misuse, as well as those seeking to maintain contact arrangements with their children. When considering any exemption, we have to ensure that limited resources are targeted most effectively. Those further exemptions are not a cost-effective way to address people's needs given that, within these overarching groups, circumstances vary widely-a point made so eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham-when we need to find an efficient way of channelling support to the people who really need it.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000097"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, referred to disabled groups such as the autistic. The existing exemptions from the shared accommodation rate will remain, ensuring that people who are severely disabled and young people under age 22 leaving care are protected from the restriction. Those who are in supported accommodation or social housing are also not subject to this restriction, so it is not necessarily the case that all or most of those with autism will be affected.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000098"></a>While sharing accommodation may be unsuitable for some, it is not unsuitable for everyone in any particular group. The exemptions proposed in the

They are also very broad and could lead to variations in interpretation. The term "or other special reason" is particularly open to interpretation.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000099"></a>The solution that we are looking at is discretionary housing payments. I am aware that noble Lords are having a little bit of fun with the loaves and fishes analogy. If I am the Minister giving out loaves and fishes, I have to accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, that I am unlikely on the surface to be a bad man, given precedent. It is clear that a lot changes are going to take place in the marketplace. Markets are responsive; people are going to change behaviour. There will be a residue of hard cases. That is what the discretionary housing payments are meant to deal with. They not only help support one-off adjustments but, as I said last week, provide long-term support in some cases.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000101"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="11102047000365"></a>Lord Freud:</b> Yes, my Lords. The whole point of the localism agenda is that choices can be made at the local level. A number of noble Lords have said today- and, indeed, last week-that we might make a bit of a saving in this budget but see a very expensive repercussion in another. The whole point of localism is that those circumstances should be able to be looked at in the round on a local basis. The question has been asked whether localities are competent to make those judgments. I would argue that they have every incentive to become very competent in making them.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000102"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="11102047000366"></a>Lord Wigley:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that response and clarification. He will be as aware as I am that certain locations have a disproportionate number of difficult circumstances and will run up substantial bills. One thinks of some of the old holiday towns, for example Rhyl in north Wales. In those circumstances does the Minister have any fine tuning of the discretionary awards in order to meet what may be excessive charges?</p>

<p><a name="11102047000103"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew20"></a><a name="11102047000367"></a>Lord Freud:</b> Yes, my Lords. We are currently looking at how to allocate the additional discretionary payments to councils and clearly we need to look at the factors that will create additional costs for different councils. We are conducting an exercise to do that; we are not just blindly following the current allocation of discretionary payments, because we know that there are additional burdens. We will make those changes.</p>

That is right; this is not only a question of local authorities having the power to make those decisions. However, is it not also right that they can do that effectively only if they are properly resourced  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>overall in the first place? If they are not, the Government are imposing impossible judgments on local authorities. In a sense, they are moving away from making these decisions and leaving them to local councils, thereby putting them in an impossible position.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000105"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="11102047000369"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, it is probably not appropriate to go into great depth on the theory of localism, and the noble Lord has had more experience of this than perhaps he would have liked. If there are large savings to be made by the efficient use of money across particular services, it would make sense overall for local authorities to be in a position to make those judgments. The financial incentive is there, and there is no need to go into this in detail because the noble Lord has had huge opportunities to do so. That is what the philosophy is here.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000106"></a>We reconsider the allocation each year and will continue to do so. Noble Lords will remember that on Tuesday I agreed to write to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, about where the money might go and the modelling of discretionary housing payments. I will write that letter and circulate it to Members of the Committee, but I have to preface that offer by saying that the analysis behind that is by its nature very difficult. We are talking about discretionary payments so there is a limit to what I can say about how those payments might be made.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000107"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="11102047000370"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I must apologise to noble Lords that I was unable to be here at the beginning of this debate. However, the Minister very helpfully reminded us that somebody who is a risk to others would not be expected to share accommodation, which is certainly a start. Psychiatrists have to discharge people from psychiatric hospitals into the community all the time. Let us take the case of somebody who is not exactly a risk to others but whose ongoing rehabilitation would nevertheless be incredibly badly hindered if they were moved into shared accommodation. If a psychiatrist was willing to write a letter to the effect that they could discharge this person into the community on the condition that they could have a place on their own, would that be a straightforward decision for the officer to make? Could that officer exercise their discretion? It will be very difficult for officers, other than professional psychiatrists, to assess whether this would be a disaster or very helpful. As the Minister says, it could be helpful but it honestly could be very, very unhelpful for a lot of people.</p>

It is interesting how there is some support for people in this position where they are deliberately made to share. There is a supportive nature to getting a group. I am conscious that there are some wonderful operations that work on that principle, which is why it is so difficult. However, if there were a letter from a psychiatrist that said, "We will not release this person unless it is into self-contained accommodation", that would seem to give the responsible housing authority a fairly clear steer towards what he should be spending his discretionary housing payment upon. I do not think we need to overelaborate on that.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000109"></a>The noble Baroness's question brings into focus the problem with blanket exemptions: they are not appropriate, even for the particular group that we feel very supportive of-people with mental conditions or recovering from them. In view of this remise of last week's debate, I hope that what I have said allows the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000110"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="11102047000372"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I am grateful for the Minister's response. I want to clarify a point about parents and children and fostering the relationship between them. I have no experience in local government, but is it easy and clear enough for local government officials to see that not supporting contact between a daughter and father will be so detrimental to the local environment that that is something that they should prioritise, or should it be more apparent to us in national government to recognise that in 20 years' time we will reap great benefits from having a daughter grow up with a good relationship with her father?</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000111"></a>That is a specific question. Behind that, given what the Prime Minister, David Cameron, was quoted as saying, given the recent push from the honourable Sarah Teather, the Minister of State, and given the great concern that this Government particularly have-indeed, that all Governments have had-to support families, is this not perhaps an area where an exemption needs to be given more thought? It is important to be efficient, but some risks are so great that a bit of inefficiency is worth the cost in order to save us from great harm.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000112"></a>I note what the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, said about pregnant women. I know I am adding another level to this, but it is related to the question of relationships between parents and children. Can the Minister give us a bit of comfort on this point?</p>

<p><a name="11102047000113"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="11102047000373"></a>Lord Freud:</b> The noble Earl raises the complex issue, which we have been looking at very closely, of whether exemptions are appropriate in this area, and we have reluctantly come to the view that they simply are not appropriate. It is just so complicated to define and difficult to police. As we all know, the costs of family breakdown are extraordinarily high, and it is difficult to organise a state system to manage that in the fullest possible way. When we looked at this, the numbers of non-resident parents who kept in touch with their children were, regrettably, relatively small. On the question of whether that keeping in touch was overnight and whether that was an essential, the numbers shrank even more. So we were looking at a very small issue in terms of numbers and an incredibly high cost due to the way that it would then be used if we had a blanket exemption.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000114"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="11102047000374"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> My Lords, that does not follow at all. We know that, currently, 50 per cent of NRPs lose contact with their children after two years. One of the reasons, obviously, is that they move away from the area or that the relationship with the parent with care was casual and therefore was not ongoing. But the Minister cannot say that, because of that, the number who would have overnight care would shrink and shrink. One of the reasons for that is precisely the difficulty, even now, of younger NRPs.  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC136"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>They have the most casual relationships. The under-25s are not entitled to separate accommodation where it  is safe to have the child. We know that the older the parent, the more likely the non-resident parent is to have contact with their children. Those coming out of divorce are more likely to because they have the accommodation and the income, and they can afford to keep in touch. For those who do not have contact, that is connected with their age and accommodation. In a way, the problem is being used by the Minister as an explanation. It is not. It is the problem.</p>

I was not referring to the smaller group, but to the group that we are talking about. I am very happy to write to the noble Earl on the figures and the scale of the problem. Rather than spending a lot of time on that now, that is the best way for me to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000116"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="11102047000376"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I would be grateful to the Minister for that.</p>

My regret is that while we in this Committee have come to value from the Minister, who I rate highly, a willingness to take a wider perspective and understand that costs do not stop when you chop a benefit-they merely get exported somewhere else-I am sorry that today, on something which affects so many vulnerable people, he has unusually taken such a narrow, cost-focused agenda, leaving other bodies, agencies and often children to pay the bill for that narrow agenda. The costs have been exported elsewhere.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000118"></a>We have seen some of the examples offered today by colleagues around the Table: the care and education of children, offered by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel; or contact with children, powerfully argued by my noble friend Lady Sherlock; or the mental health of someone with obsessive disorder from the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell; or women's safety, mentioned by my noble friend; the ability to find work; pregnancy; and health. The costs of addressing all of these issues will be exported to other agencies. They will not go away. The DWP may make its savings. Housing benefit may make some savings. But the costs will be exported somewhere else and, in the process of the hand-on, I suspect from my experience that the costs and the problems will get larger and multiply.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000119"></a>I think that this is the first time since he has taken office that I have said this to the Minister: this is unbelievably short-sighted. This is not an all-encompassing amendment, saying "Get rid of the 25-to-35 rule". It is quite clearly focused on two groups. The first is women, particularly those who are likely to get back into work within a year-it could be a good year for a man. We should not put them through the trauma of possibly three house moves in the space of nine months in order to satisfy some narrow benefit rules.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000120"></a>The second is a group of very vulnerable people. I am perfectly happy-as I am sure that my noble friends around the Table from different areas on this  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC137"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have greater expertise than I-to work with the Minister to get a more precise and useful definition of those most at risk. We do not have to take opposite sides on this. I am sure that we share a common agenda. As my noble friend Lord McAvoy correctly said, we do not want to expose this fairly narrow group of people to the risks that may come as a result of the Government's changes. If we can work with the Minister, and the expertise around this Table-which I gently point out matches that of the department-can be drawn upon, then I am sure that my noble friends and all colleagues around the Table will be happy to offer it. But this will not do.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000121"></a>None of us has any problem if people, whether in good health or poor health, wish to share with other people. That is fine, particularly as they are likely to be sharing with friends-and many of them do. But the amendment focuses on two particular groups. I am not trying to repeal this back to 25, although I wish I could, but I accept the cost arguments and the Government's agenda. I am trying to focus on two groups, the first of which is those recently in work and trying to get back into work. They will be sabotaged-I mean that, sabotaged-because their energy, effort and focus will go instead on having to sort out their accommodation. That is folly beyond belief and so short-sighted. I am puzzled that the Minister would run with that argument. The second group is vulnerable people. There are people with far more expertise than I around this Table who would be happy to work with the Minister to come up with more precise definitions and to extend the categories of those who should be protected, either because they would be a risk to themselves or a risk to others if we force shared accommodation on them. Frankly, they will otherwise be on the streets or in homeless accommodation.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000122"></a>My noble friend Lord McAvoy has made it very clear that this is not an all-encompassing amendment. I tried to press the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, who came in with some ambiguous support for the Minister-the only support he had, I think-as to which groups on my list he would exclude, but answer came there none. But my experience and that of the noble Baroness who talked about HMOs shows that they will be reducing just at the time when pressure on them increases as the numbers rise. Students are in a  far better financial position, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, said, to access this accommodation. We are now learning that landlords cannot make money out of this unless it involves at least four bedrooms plus, which means that they are mainly going to be picking up large Victorian and Edwardian houses. HMOs for people other than students are going to be reducing just at the point when the numbers increase.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000123"></a>My noble friend Lady Hayter made this point clearly and I am sorry that the Minister did not respond to it. What will happen to rents when we have a reducing number of HMOs and an increasing number of people seeking access? Under the legislation, something like 60,000 new places will be needed. Rents are going to soar. What will happen to the quality of available property that people can afford within the 30 per cent rule? The quality will go down

Again, this is not an all-encompassing amendment. Many of us would be perfectly happy to work with the noble Lord and to share the experience that is around this Room.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000124"></a>On discretionary housing allowance, I would say that it is becoming the lucky bran tub. I shall not talk about loaves and fishes, but the lucky bran tub. My authority, Norwich, ran out half way through the year. The money is going to increase by something like threefold. I checked to see what the money was being spent on. Largely- not entirely but largely-it was being spent on families who had lost the home they had been seeking to pay for. They were going into emergency or temporary accommodation and needed additional help with their rent above and beyond what they were entitled to, given their income and the rent charged. That money is going to go up threefold and, as a result, instead of being helped for just a couple of months, families may now be helped for a little bit longer. Perhaps more families facing that situation may be helped, particularly as the recession bites. But none of the money will go to any of the groups listed here. That may change, but all they will have is a tiny amount because in effect only one-third of the total will be new money. That cannot even begin to have an impact on a quarter of these groups.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000125"></a>I hope that the Minister can set out in a letter, one that I am sure we would all wish to see, how he expects this money to be apportioned given the bids that are going to be made on it. I would be content if I could be persuaded that the discretionary housing allowance was genuinely generous enough to allow local authorities to make local choices, to help the groups most in need at a time when the pressure on this accommodation is going to double. If I can be given that reassurance, that will be fine. I am a local government person and I would welcome that autonomy.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000126"></a>As to talk about loaves and fishes, I cannot believe this money will be faintly appropriate. The Minister said the savings will be £200 million and that the additional money going in will be something like  £20 million to £40 million for all fields of housing cuts. It does not even begin to connect.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000127"></a>I hope the Minister will write to us and tell us how he expects this money to be expended; how we can avoid unnecessary churning; and in what ways we can tighten the amendment to meet his willingness, perhaps, to extend the categories. It will not do to have the poorest, most vulnerable, most fragile people in our community bearing some of the most savage cuts in the Government's proposals. These should fall on broad shoulders. We should not have a council tax freeze at a time when people such as these face having to move out of accommodation into shared room rent or get into serious arrears. It is not right, it is not fair, and I am sure the Minister agrees with me. I hope he does. I hope, as a result, that he will come back to us. If not, we will press him with further amendments to ensure that if he cannot support an amendment that lists exemptions, he will ensure that there will be sufficient resource in the discretionary housing allowance for those groups most in need, most vulnerable, and who none of us with any claims of decency should see going to the wall. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I apologise for trespassing on the Committee's time. I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Best, was able to add his name to the amendment.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000129"></a>As we know, housing benefit costs £21 billion a year, and the Minister, in his evidence to the Work and Pensions Committee, showed that between November 2008 and February 2010 the average rent paid to LHA claimants increased by 3 per cent, whereas in the non-LHA market rents fell by 5 per cent. The Minister therefore argued that LHA rates were inflationary because landlords increased rents to their level as HB claimants form 40 per cent of the market. Accordingly, if the Government reduced local housing allowance, landlords, he argued, would have to reduce their rents because LHA tenants were such a significant part of the market. Hence, LHA would be fixed in future according to the 30th rather than the 50th percentile of average rent levels and would rise only by CPI. This would bear down, he argued finally, on rent levels and on the LHA bill. I hope I have been fair to the Minister's arguments. If I have not, I am sure he will correct me.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000130"></a>If the Minister is right, there could be a valuable cut in LHA expenditure without pain to the tenant because the pressure would be bearing down on the landlord. If he is wrong, many of the tenants will find themselves unable to find or afford adequate accommodation in the private rented sector and arrears, evictions and homelessness will grow. Is the Minister right? I think he is wrong-but the truth is that we will not be fully sure until the changes have been in place for a couple of years and the outcome reviewed. The Minister is evidence-based-this is one of his many characteristics, and the Committee is delighted that he exhibits that towards us-and that is welcome. He has already agreed to one housing review, proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Best, earlier, which again is much welcomed: hence this amendment. We must find out, before too much damage is possibly done, whether cuts in local housing allowance cut private sector rents. I do not care about the time span of the CSR and that this may fall outside it; this is a matter for this  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC140"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bill and I am sure that we want to have scrutiny-post-legislative scrutiny, if you like-of what is being done. I hope the Minister will give us that commitment today.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000131"></a>Why do I believe the Minister is probably wrong that cutting HB will force down rents to make them follow the path of HB, which is the essence of his argument? First, I think he is wrong in his analysis of what happened between 2008 and 2010. Secondly, for the future, if the private rented sector was frozen with a finite number of tenants for a finite number of properties, then his reading that the market will find equilibrium might well be correct, but it is not and it will not be.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000132"></a>What happened between 2008 and 2010? Yes, HB bills rose faster than rents, on average, but that was not because they were being pushed up by transparent local HA rates. Recent research from the Chartered Institute of Housing and the British Property Federation shows that it was mainly due to more people claiming in London and the south-east, where rents and HB are higher. In that period, LHA costs fell in two-thirds of the country, but in one-third they rose: in London and the south. The case load doubled from 400,000 to almost 1 million, and that growth was disproportionately in the south where rents are higher. In November 2008, the southern half of England provided 49.6 per cent of claimants and the north and the midlands provided 50.39 per cent. By March 2010, the share of the south-the high rent, higher HB area-had risen from 49.6 per cent to 52.27 per cent and that of the north and the Midlands had fallen proportionately. That is why the LHA bill rose. Had the case load numbers and composition stayed the same, the rents paid by LHA would have fallen by 1 per cent, not risen by 3 per cent. There is no inflationary loop back. The Minister's argument rests on that fallacy.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000133"></a>Why have more claims and claims for higher rents been made in London and the south-east? It is because of what is happening elsewhere in the housing market. Every year those who cannot enter owner-occupation, who increase the pressure on rents, and those who cannot enter social housing, who increase the pressure on HB, flow into the private rented sector. They are those in low-paid work, the disabled or the elderly. It is a sort of perfect storm. Owner-occupiers who cannot find the deposit are now lingering in the private rented sector for five or 10 years longer than they would have done a decade before. Council waiting lists have grown hugely as stock dwindles with sales while new build is simultaneously slashed, so social renters linger 10 or more years longer in the private rented sector as they wait and hope. Instead of the private rented sector being a transitional tenure, it is now often a long-stay tenure. Newcomers flow in, but existing tenants do not flow out. That is why rents rise.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000134"></a>Problems in matching supply and demand in the other two sectors-owner-occupiers and social housing-are experienced as huge pressure on the private rented sector. Increase in that demand is far exceeding the modest increase in supply. With six, 10, sometimes  15 applicants chasing every PRS letting, landlords do not have to let and they do not and will not let to people on LHA. They have a choice. They do not let, they do not want to let and they have said so loud and  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC141"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clear. In addition, PRS rents are rising fast as a result of this pressure. Savills says they rose by 6.6 per cent in the past year, and some forecast even higher rises next year, at a time when CPI, although rising, will rise by far less. Therefore each and every year the gap between what will be covered by the local housing allowance and the rents actually being charged will widen. It is now at the 30th percentile. In three to five years it will slip down, probably to the 20th percentile. In six or eight years or so, it will slip to only those at the 10th percentile, making 90 per cent of privately rented homes unaffordable. In 10 years, in much of the south-east there may be virtually no affordable private rented sector accommodation for those on HB. We have had examples from Winchester where I think there is probably none. In the next decade, we expect only 5 per cent of two-bedroom flats in Manchester will be affordable to tenants under private HB.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000135"></a>Looking backwards, between 1997 and 2007, rents increased by 70 per cent and CPI by 20 per cent. That is the gap. Because benefit was not operated by CPI, that gap was far narrower. In future, if that gap is to be replicated, people on the 30th percentile will be forced down and down until in various towns and cities virtually no private housing will be available. That is what I fear. I hope I am wrong but I doubt it. We need to know because the stakes for those on HB are far too high to leave it to the abstract economic theory of the markets. Forty per cent of those in the market may find themselves priced out because they have no leverage. For too many landlords, HB tenants are becoming the tenants of last choice.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000136"></a>Alex Fenton's Cambridge research shows that if tenants try to meet the resulting shortfall themselves, 60,000 families and their children will be in severe poverty and well below the poverty line. He thinks it is possible that 200,000 families will face evictions. He, too, may be wrong, but on behalf of vulnerable people we cannot afford not to know. We must keep this situation under review, so every two years we must restore the LHA level to the 30th percentile that the Government intend and not allow a downward drift to increase the cuts that fall on those least able to bear them.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000137"></a>I hope that the Minister is willing to engage in that tracking and research, and to ensure that every two years we restore the policy intention of this legislation. All Ministers have an obligation, which I am sure he welcomes and shares, to ensure that the purpose and intent of legislation is respected. If there should be any deviations or additional factors, they should be able to bring it back to its original intent. All we are asking is that there is a measure in place to ensure that the legislation proposed by the Government will persist and not find itself drifting down, to the cost of homeless people across the country. I beg to move.</p>

Will rents go up by more than the amount available to pay them, leaving people with a serious problem? The Minister has said that it is hoped that rents will be kept down by the restraints on housing benefit and the restraint on housing costs that are helped by universal credit. Rents through these measures, which are so controversial, will be restrained, which should mean that increasing the support for tenants on the basis of the CPI does not hurt anyone too much because rents are relatively static. That may happen. In some parts of the country, so many people are dependent on housing benefit that, like it or not, landlords may have to tailor their rents to the level that is paid through universal credit and housing benefit for their tenants. Landlords may be pressured into keeping their rents down.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000140"></a>In other places, it seems improbable that this will happen. If rents do rise, they will get further and further away from what people have available to pay them. In London and the south-east, we have already seen rents going up by a lot. Noble Lords may ask whether it is possible that rents can keep on exponentially increasing in the way that they have, or whether they are bound to flatten out. An awful lot of people who would have been home purchasers-first-time buyers-are becoming and staying tenants.</p>
<h5><a name="11102047000335"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000141"></a>These people have a higher income. They could have bought were it not for the fact that they are required to pay a deposit of perhaps £35,000 or £40,000-far too much for them to accumulate. However, they have the money to pay in rent if they have to. It might have been a much better option for them to buy but they do have the resources. These are an extra ingredient in the marketplace in London and the south-east, which mean that this extra group will be able to afford increased rents, which means that landlords will be able to turn away those who are dependent on benefits and accept this new expanding group. This means that it would be unwise to speculate that rents will be restrained by the housing benefit cuts and the measures that we have all been talking about. It seems quite probable that others will replace those tenants. Landlords can be choosy, particularly in London and the south-east. The impact on poorer households will therefore be as bad as many of us have feared.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000142"></a>I was extremely grateful to the Minister for agreeing to set up a substantial independent review of the impact of the housing benefit cuts on families, poverty and local authorities. The exercise will be extremely helpful. It has involved the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the University of Oxford, the University of Sheffield and Ipsos MORI in a comprehensive way. It will be an excellent piece of work, from which we will be able to discover the exact impact of these cuts. It would be very helpful to get a commitment from the Minister, however it is phrased, that if this review shows that, in at least some parts of the country, rents are moving upwards and getting out of line with the basis on which there is an increase in the amount given to tenants to help them pay their rent, that gap will be addressed. In this way, among others proposed in the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, payments to tenants would always be restored according to the  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relationship to rents being paid in the marketplace, rather than getting out of line. That would be an enormously helpful commitment in advance of receiving the results, which may show that it is unnecessary and that increasing rents in line with CPI is enough to keep payments to tenants in line with what they face in the real world.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000143"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew32"></a><a name="11102047000381"></a>Baroness Wilkins:</b> Could the noble Lord remind the Committee when that review is likely to report?</p>

We will get an interim report next spring, a more detailed report this time next year and a final report two years from now. All these reports will be helpful in building our knowledge and understanding. However, they will be of value only if the Minister will do something about the results that come in.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000145"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew34"></a><a name="11102047000383"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, we support these amendments in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Best, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, for the reasons that have been very clearly set out. Indeed, these are modest amendments; they do not carry a major price tag. Certainly, the commitment to a review of what is happening to housing costs in relation to uprating amounts is absolutely crucial. There is the concern that there will be a growing mismatch between levels of housing support and rent. If that is the case, inevitably arrears will grow, personal debt will increase and homelessness will rise. Our briefing on this issue suggests that as many as 1.4 million local housing allowance claimants could be affected, with an average reduction in entitlement of just under £300 a year.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000146"></a>As we have heard, a particular concern is that the use of CPI for uprating the local housing allowance, which is planned to be carried forward into the universal credit, will lead to ever-widening disparities between the level of rents and that of housing support allowance.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000147"></a>The debate is not intrinsically about whether CPI is a better measure of inflation than RPI, although there is an argument about that generally in relation to benefit uprating. On housing, the debate is about whether it reflects what is actually happening to rent levels in the private sector. Currently, levels of support are generally determined by what is happening in each broad rental market area. There are disputes or arguments at the moment about whether those areas are properly drawn; indeed, there were two earlier housing benefit rent restriction regimes-the local reference rent rules and the pre-January 1966 rules-but I understand that those are going to be subsumed into the general uprating under universal credit.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000148"></a>We have heard from my noble friend Lady Hollis that between 1997-98 and 2007-08 average rents increased by 70 per cent, while over the same period CPI increased by only 20 per cent. The point has already been made that the Government are looking to score significant savings from the proposed link with CPI, and there is a question about whether the cost of that will fall on landlords, as we have heard, or on tenants. Is not the evidence to date that it will to fall on tenants? The evidence of downward pressure on rents that these changes generally to housing benefit would cause is simply not coming through.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC144"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000149"></a>I reinforce the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Best: if as a matter of fact it is demonstrated in due course that private sector rents are not responding to downward pressure as the Government anticipate, and if the Government can be convinced that there is a growing disparity between the basis of uprating and what is actually happening to rents, will they change course on this?</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000150"></a>Part of the Government's argument, as I understand it, is that simply uprating by one factor adds to simplicity and sits easily alongside the uprating of other benefits. Of course, that does not take account of the fact that we are not dealing here with one single housing market. There is a whole range of housing markets in different parts of the country; even within different parts of the country, there are different pressures and considerations on what is driving rent changes.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000151"></a>I want to ask the Minister about another issue. As we have discussed, housing allowance levels are currently set on a monthly basis. Once the system of uprating by a single index is in place, what will happen to the valuation office capacity that is currently engaged in that task? If in due course it were agreed that we should return to some basis of evaluating local housing allowance support on the basis as computed at the moment, with valuation offices looking at what is happening in individual markets, will the capacity be there in future to do it if you have already moved down the path of eschewing that process and simply use a CPI uprating?</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000152"></a>What would the relevance of the 30th percentile be in future for new claimants? Is it proposed that they would look at the original 30th percentile figure that was subsequently uprated, irrespective of any changes that may have taken in the broad market area that generated those figures initially, and ignore what regeneration development there has been in those areas? Is it proposed that monthly percentile figures will still be produced? It is inevitable, if we go down the path of a single factor applied across the board to changes and uprating in local housing allowance support, that we are going to drive uncertainties, concerns and disparities in the market, particularly a growing gap between local housing allowance levels of support that people get and their actual costs. This is in the context of a whole raft of other measures which are applied before we deal with the uprating: the move from median to 30th percentile and the caps on overall levels of benefit and individual levels of rent depending on the size of property. Those have all been applied first, yet on top of them is the real risk that the CPI uprating will impose even greater restrictions than those individual, supposedly carefully crafted ones introduce to bear down on housing benefit levels.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000153"></a>The key question for the Minister is: in the event that the evidence shows that the levels of support generated by CPI uprating or any other means is moving significantly away from the changes in cost that people actually having to bear, will the Government move back from that approach? Will they adopt a changed stance?</p>

<p><a name="11102047000154"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="11102047000384"></a>Lord Freud:</b> I should start by reminding your Lordships of the context of this: the rapid growth in housing expenditure over the last decade, in cash terms from  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>£11 billion to £22 billion-up 50 per cent in real terms. Our efforts here are to try and get control of that market place. We need to do more than what this amendment proposes to limit the growth in benefit expenditure on housing and avoid claimants being trapped on benefits by occupying housing that they could never afford in work.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000155"></a>On the questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, effectively on whether housing benefit drives the market, the simple fact is that some 40 per cent of private sector tenants receive housing benefit. Effectively, we inject into that market some £8.8 billion each year. Clearly, the way that we do that inevitably has an impact on how that market behaves. I accept that it is a very complicated market and it is not a straightforward matter to influence. The noble Lord, Lord Best, essentially made that point on the complexity and the uncertainties involved in trying to get a market response.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000156"></a>In some areas where local rents are particularly expensive, we will cap the maximum that private sector tenants can be paid for the housing element of universal credit. That will effectively ensure that claimants encounter the same choices about affordability as are available to working families. All noble Lords are aware that there is a fundamental issue here in the supply of housing. We announced in July both that 146 providers of affordable housing will deliver 80,000 new homes at affordable rent and also affordable home ownership with government funding of just under £1.8 billion. Shared ownership will be available where appropriate to local circumstances.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para118"></a>

Our efforts to get Britain building again continue with a £4.5 billion affordable homes programme set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 new homes over the next four years, compared to the 150,000 originally estimated. The Government are creating the conditions to get the house-building industry building again. We recognise the particular challenges that first-time buyers face at the moment.</p>

Of course he has his surrogate Members, the Liberal Democrats, coming along and walking the tightrope, but it would show some Conservative enthusiasm if Back-Benchers were here to listen to the Minister and perhaps to be persuaded by my noble friend Lady Hollis from time to time.</p>

The noble Lord wishes that all Conservative Back-Benchers should have a good dose of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, to get them into the right frame of mind. This is good fun, but we have business to do, so let us get back to it, although I am now completely distracted from what I was going to say.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000164"></a>I was talking about the way we are supporting first-time buyers with First Buy, which will help 2,500 aspiring home owners by spring 2013. First Buy will maintain capacity in the house-building industry in the short term and support 5,000 to 10,000 net jobs in England in 2011-12 and 2012-13. Those are measures to help first-time buyers back into the market.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000165"></a>My core response to this amendment is that, bluntly, it is unnecessary. As I have said, we are committed to making savings from the CPI measure until 2014-15. After that, if local housing allowance rates are clearly out of step with rents, they can be reconsidered. I have made that clear in the past. It will be up to a future Government to decide how LHA rates will be set from the end of that spending review. I do not believe there is a substantial difference between the parties on this. I was interested to see that Liam Byrne for the Opposition during the Budget debate said that where:</p>
<ul><a name="11102047000327"></a>"there is a temporary switch from RPI to CPI for the next three years ... we will support that".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/3/11/; col. 201.]</ul>
<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000166"></a>This is a response to the crisis. It is not exactly the same point, but a parallel point, and the true difference between us is having set it without a formal adjustment to the process. I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Best, that in the long run there is a difference between how rents move and how CPI moves, so clearly it will need to be looked at very closely then. Even more than that point, we have commissioned independent research to evaluate the impact of reform to housing benefit, as the noble Lord, Lord Best said. That is a very good and very fine review. I am extremely pleased to have it. I think it will be the most interesting piece of housing research we have ever seen in this country, and I am proud to have been able to find the funding for it. As he said, we will be getting the initial findings next spring and consequently they will be refined over the next year or so. Clearly we will take those findings very seriously. I am not going to make a formal commitment here about that, but we will take those findings very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000167"></a>In response to the question of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, about the role of rent officers and the capacity in that area, we will still need rents in the local market to be tracked so there is likely still to be a role for rent officers in dealing with the residual cases that do not fit within the mainstream local housing allowance rules. So there is a dual reason to maintain capacity in that area.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000170"></a>I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, will agree with the necessity of controlling the level of rents paid, both to limit rises in benefit expenditure and to avoid trapping claimants in the benefits system. I further hope that she will agree that the safeguards that I have outlined are sufficient. For these reasons I urge the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000172"></a>The noble Lord is betting the bank on landlords cutting or controlling rents in the future. We are seeing caps on housing benefit in total, as my noble friend said, and a reduction in financial support for rent to levels of 30 per cent rather than 50 per cent of private rent averages. This will be lifted only by CPI, which is well below everything that we know has been happening to rent levels. Leaving aside the caps at the top end, which is a central London problem, we find that both factors-the reduction to 30 per cent on the one hand and the uplifting only by CPI on the other-will bear heavily down on what tenants can afford to pay for the rent they are expected to face. Therefore the Minister is betting the bank on landlords cutting their rent accordingly. I am sure that in some places they will; I am sure that at the bottom end of the market, where anyone who is not on benefit does not want to live, they will have to cut to fit. We can be fairly sure that some of the grottiest, poorest and most sub-standard of housing may remain available to tenants as a result-but even that will become reduced in supply if, as we fear, the gap between what tenants are able to pay and what landlords can get on the open market widens. The Minister is betting the house on the fact that it will not widen. If he is so confident, he can afford to track it. If he is right, I will be genuinely pleased. I want tenants to have decent accommodation, as we all do, at an affordable price; we do not want to see hidden subsidies going to landlords unnecessarily. Why is he hesitant to track it? We want the information. He needs the information to see whether his policy is right. He must get that research loop back into his policy. He says it can be reconsidered after 2014-15; all we are asking is that it will be reconsidered after 2014-15. Will he take that on board? If he does not, how can he justify calling his policy evidence based if he does not have the evidence because he has failed to collect it in time for us to reconsider it, if necessary, in 2014-15?</p>

When you reconsider something-if you can reconsider it-you need to look at the information that will allow you to reconsider it. Reconsideration implies that you change something. I do not think there is a difference between what we are talking about. I have said that we will look at this matter very closely at that period and, if necessary, we will be able reconsider it. I am trying to say to the noble Baroness that we are doing what she wants. It may not be in the exact format that she wants, but I have essentially assured her of a process that satisfies her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000174"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew46"></a><a name="11102047000395"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. We are passing each other by on the word reconsideration. For me, reconsideration does not mean that you will change, but that you will reconsider the evidence. You can call it consider the evidence, you can call it reconsider the evidence, I do not mind. What I want is a guarantee, if I can put it that way, which I hope the Minister has effectively given us, that over the next couple of years we will reconsider the issue and therefore consider the evidence to make sure that the policy intent of the Government that we cap private rented sector housing allowance at the 30th percentile of rents is continued.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000175"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, has already shown her concerns about what is happening in Winchester. Many of us have the experience in the south of England that already the Minister's hopes are being disappointed. If his understanding-and my understanding is the same-is that the evidence will be looked at to see whether the policy objective that the private rented sector housing allowance can be kept pinned to the 30th percentile, I am well content. That is the assurance I am seeking, and also that the Minister will ensure we regularly review the evidence to keep it pinned to the 30th percentile rather than, as history suggests, letting it drift down and depart further from that figure with no mechanism to reconsider.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000176"></a>Will the Minister make it clear that we are indeed saying the same thing-that the Government will keep under review and, if necessary, reconsider the evidence behind their commitment at this stage to a 30th percentile private rented sector housing allowance?</p>

We are having one of the best, if not the best, housing reviews taking us into the middle of 2013, which is your first two years. That will be available and then the next stage will be the end of the spending review, which is fortuitously roughly two years later, where I have said there is a point of consideration, reconsideration or what have you. I think that is exactly what the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, is looking at.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000182"></a>In some ways I am hesitant to return to a subject on which I commented in the last, very lengthy and complex group that we considered the other night, because there was an amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Kennedy that dealt very much with the same subject. I shall attempt not to repeat all my arguments in our previous sitting, but I am afraid that I shall have to repeat some of them. Indeed, the exchange between the Minister and my noble friend Lady Hollis, immediately preceding the brief break that we had, seems to give greater weight to what I am saying and indicates that the Government are, or appear to be, at least two-thirds of the way down to what I am asking them to do in these amendments.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000183"></a>My centre of contention is that this is a monster of a Bill and a huge problem for the Government to deal with. We have seen the complexity of the impact of their proposed changes on the housing costs element on the different groups and their differential effects. My argument the other night was that there is a difference between the housing cost element and every other part of the welfare system that we are trying to take into the universal credit system. All the other parts relate to the circumstances of the individual or the household. Housing costs-housing benefit as is-relate to that but also to the particular housing market, by type of tenure and geographical location in which the particular household finds itself.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000184"></a>That is a different basis. We can see, as another of the exchanges between my noble friend Lady Hollis and the Minister indicate, drastic differences in different parts of the country and in different types of tenure on how costs are moving and the relevance of the housing benefit level that is now being proposed, compared with the reality of the rents or housing costs structure. The Government are proposing huge other changes in the Localism Bill and elsewhere in relation  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to tenure, housing revenue and the whole management of social housing. The Minister briefly alluded to their targets for more affordable homes, which I applaud. I applaud the Prime Minister's announcement in Manchester the other week about increasing the number of homes, although he did not give any great details about what leverage he had to reach those targets. The Chancellor announced that he would extend the right to buy but without any indication as to what he would do with the proceeds and whether that would increase or decrease the supply of affordable housing as a result.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000185"></a>Housing market issues are addressed both by the Government in CLG and by reference to the banking system, which seriously affects the top end of the market. If people cannot get credit for mortgages it has a downward cascading effect on the rest of the forms of tenure. That is a huge problem for the Government. I am not pretending that the previous Government got it right: they certainly did not. But it is worse and the Government recognise that there is a serious problem. How you then apply the household subsidy to a rapidly changing housing market and bring it at the same time into a universal benefit is an incredibly difficult problem.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000186"></a>Reference to the concession that the Minister made to the noble Lord, Lord Best, some time ago relating to the review indicates the size of the problem. The Minister has described that review as the best since Roman times in terms of assessment of what the housing needs of the population are. If that is the case, surely he should be prepared to accept my amendment, or something like it, which says simply that we need to decouple the housing costs element from the rest of this Bill, or at least give the Government the opportunity to do so and allow for a major review on the totality of housing policy before we finalise the provisions on the housing cost element.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000187"></a>That is all the amendments are asking for. The Minister indicated that the review will take us to 2013 before we will really be able to assess the position and drive something logically from that which will apply to the benefits side of the equation. If that is the case, he needs full scope to take a different course on that part of the welfare system from the other parts. He may say that under the commencement provisions at the back of this Bill he has a bit of flexibility anyway. But I am also asking to write into the legislation that we conduct that review of the totality of the scope of the housing policy and take it into account before finalising those provisions.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000188"></a>My noble friend Lord Touhig asked the Minister's colleague a Question this morning on the risk to this whole project. It was interesting to learn that the Treasury did not have a risk register, which probably explains quite a lot. However, it was also clear that the main concern in the House was about the IT implementation of the Bill. I agree with those anxieties. My noble friend Lord Knight will have something to say about them a little later, as he did this morning. However, before we get to the implementation there is a risk to this project in that we do not have a coherent approach to housing policy in  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>order to write the specification for the IT implementation of this system. If the whole of universal credit provision requires us to get that right, it endangers the whole project.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000189"></a>I am arguing here that the Minister should accept that the housing side is so complex, and has such multiple and differential effects-on the markets, the credit system and the welfare side-that before the Government take a coherent view on that, it would be wrong to go into quite as much detail on the housing costs element until we have been through the review. I have not yet seen the full terms of reference but I hope the Minister is right and that this will be a very thorough review and one of the best that the Government have ever undertaken into housing. I look forward to it and will congratulate the Government if that is the case. However, they must follow the logic of that. If that is the case, and it is a fundamental review of the kind that the Minister claims, it has profound implications for the Bill, how we deal with it in this House and how the Government implement it thereafter.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000190"></a>Therefore, I strongly suggest that the noble Lord accepts at least the principle of these amendments, even if he is not prepared to accept the exact wording. I do so because most, if not all, of us in this Room believe that the housing cost element should eventually feature in the universal credit. However, it will be a very difficult and fraught path to get there. On the one hand, it could upset the housing market if his assumptions about the level of private rented sector rents are wrong, or indeed if they are right in certain respects. On the other hand, it could differentially affect many of the very vulnerable groups that we have been discussing. If the Minister gets any of that wrong, he discredits the whole project. Therefore, the Government have to take what is suggested here very seriously. Let us move housing aside on to a slightly different track with the same ultimate goal; have the review that the Minister is talking about; come back and consider it; and then finalise the way in which the housing cost element will move into universal credit. I beg to move.</p>

I shall concentrate on the administration of the housing cost element and urge the Government to retain the skills and knowledge that exist in local government. I speak as a past president of NALGO, one of the forerunners of UNISON. I was also a representative of UNISON on the TUC general council for the first seven years of its formation.

It is important to emphasise that those services are provided by housing associations and private contractors across the UK as well as local government itself.

The validating exercise involves many documents, including

<p><a name="11102047000193"></a>Despite the Minister's assurances at Question Time this morning, and as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said, some of us do not believe that the claimed level of computer literacy exists to make the proposals in the Bill work. There will still be a need for face-to-face assistance, and who better to deliver this than the staff currently providing the service? Those of us who are hard-of-hearing are very grateful when we have a meeting in this room, where the loop is working very well. We come to dread going in certain committee rooms where it does not work and we cannot hear. How much harder it is for those trying to make phone calls to public services, especially when you have to choose from five different pathways and, if you miss one of those, you have to start all over again. We often need face-to-face support that those with normal hearing perhaps do not.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000194"></a>If local authorities retained responsibility for the housing cost component of universal credit, I feel sure that they would work closely with the DWP to deliver the best possible service. This view is shared by the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation, CoSLA, the Scottish Government as well as the LGA. The District Councils' Network of the LGA found in a recent survey that councils had face-to-face contact in 25 to 80 per cent of claims. This helps to reduce errors and speed up claims for vulnerable people. A single overpayment or underpayment can generate real administrative and personal difficulties for individuals.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000195"></a>I mentioned earlier external contracts. Possibly 16 per cent of local authorities have external contracts to deliver housing benefit, some of which are for between four and eight years. Sometimes, they are administered as part of a larger strategic outsourcing contract, such as with British Telecom, which can be for up to 20 years.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000196"></a>Finally, I am extremely concerned about the welfare of the 20,000 staff at present providing this service. The uncertainty and loss of morale cannot be good. If the changes proposed lead to job losses, they face the double bind of losing their jobs because of welfare reform and having to face claiming benefits under the new system. That is not an enviable position. I ask the Minister to consider my proposals.</p>

I set out at some length at Second Reading why consideration should be given to local delivery of the housing benefit element. I remind the Committee of the concern that I raised then about the information that claimants would be required to bring in to demonstrate who they were, their financial circumstances and so on. These are very important, precious documents. It would seem a sensible arrangement for them to be taken into a local office, much as you can take in documentation to the Post Office and get it checked for a passport application. Such a system could be in place in local council offices for that sort of documentation, and then feed into the IT system that we will, in time, discuss in this Committee.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000198"></a>There is also the potential for council tax benefit to be integrated. An assessment for council tax benefit could be made at the same time as that for the housing element of universal credit. That assessment could then be passed back through universal credit processing for it to be included in the payment. Given that I made these comments at Second Reading, I wonder whether the Minister has had a chance to reflect on them. If so, perhaps he could enlighten us.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000199"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew55"></a><a name="11102047000404"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I should like to comment on some of the amendments. We touched on the issue raised by the amendments of my noble friend Lord Whitty at the end of our previous session. The fundamental point that he is making is right: there are major issues of public policy around housing. They interlock; they are integrated; there are consequences certainly for how support for housing is provided for in universal credit or any other benefit system. I agree particularly with his point that housing costs elements are not only a consequence of what happens in any policy area review but they also impact on its ramifications, because they have a potential impact on the market.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000200"></a>Notwithstanding that argument, I say to my noble friend that it would be quite difficult to unpick housing benefit, local housing allowances or whatever it is from the universal credit, although I have a question for the Minister on that. If you let the current system continue alongside universal credit, you would in any event need rules as to how they interact. I suppose that would be made easier if the capital rules for housing benefit pretty much align with what is proposed for universal credit-as I think they do. I think that the taper rules for housing benefit would also currently align with what is proposed for universal credit, so some adjustment would have to be made along the way.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000201"></a>However, my noble friend makes a fundamental point. If, after this review, when the dust has settled on it and the analysis has been undertaken, it is acknowledged that the current proposals for dealing with housing support were to change-in particular, if it were accepted that we move away from a single factor of uprating those allowances year by year and perhaps revert to something like the current system, where you look on a regional or other basis at actual rents-would the system cope with that? Does that fundamentally challenge universal credit and could it be encompassed? That is, by pressing the button on universal credit as planned, are we passing the point of no return if we wanted to re-evaluate how we deal with housing support? My noble friend seems to have a valid argument in the points that he raises.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000202"></a>My noble friend Lady Donaghy spoke particularly to the amendments that our noble friend Lord Kennedy tabled. Again, I have a good deal of sympathy with the thrust of these amendments, which really touch upon the practicalities of universal credit. I know that a lot of those are issues quite properly to be worked out along the way when we have made further progress, but we are only two years away from the start of universal credit: 2013 is a near time and I am sure that the Minister is feeling the heat. I missed Questions today but I thought that the Treasury had a risk  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC154"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>register and I am surprised that it does not-I am sure that it will after this. It would be helpful to have some understanding from the Minister of some of the broad practicalities in how all this is going to work, particularly on the prospects of picking up these concepts of local delivery to which my noble friend spoke.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000203"></a>We know and understand the ambition for significant access to the system to be online and we would support that approach, but obviously it will not cover everyone. Those who access online will, presumably, necessarily all do it remotely from home. There may be some for whom face-to-face engagement prior to that is necessary and, presumably, notwithstanding the start in 2013, the existing systems will have to be maintained until migration to universal credit is complete in 2017. As I say, a start date of 2013 is now less than two years away. Powerful arguments were made for the expertise that resides in local authorities for dealing with housing benefit-their face-to-face contact and knowledge  of council tax-quite apart from the ramifications of some of the contractual issues which would have to be unpicked if that approach is not adopted.</p>
<h5><a name="11102047000340"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000204"></a>It is not only an issue for local authorities. There are many employees in HMRC and DWP, as well as in the 379 local authorities, who will be directly affected by the proposed changes. Accepting that detail is to come, perhaps the Minister can this afternoon give us at least an outline of how the system will work on a practical basis. It will be the case that not all claimants will have access to online facilities and not all will be able to move to self-service models of operation without assistance, guidance and support. What type of support is envisaged and by whom does he see it being provided? Is it envisaged that it will be entirely paperless? As my noble friend Lord Knight said, there are issues about security, identity and the sources of information that have to be provided one way or another.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000205"></a>Another point flows from this. At the moment, when they are dealing with housing benefit or council tax benefit claims, local authorities do not look narrowly at just those claims. They liaise appropriately with social services and housing. It is increasingly joined-up working, not only within local authorities but between local authorities and, not least, the DWP. We also know that, despite some of its IT challenges, HMRC does joined-up work, and it should be an integral part of channelling people to the options programme of CMEC. In universal credit, we are joining up the payment, but what is going to happen to all these different levels of co-operation that exist to support people across different policy strands, not just the benefit strand? How is that going to be provided for and encompassed in the new world of universal credit?</p>

<p><a name="11102047000206"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew56"></a><a name="11102047000405"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> My Lords, there is a distinction between local assessment and local payment. We discussed some of these issues on a previous amendment. Will the Minister confirm that you could have local assessment using existing local authority staff on a face-to-face basis so that they can deal with issues, such as concealed tenancies, which can only be known face to face? Given the ATLAS arrangements, that does not preclude the information being fed through to a universal credit payment in due course.</p>

I will e-mail everyone with the precise time. As is always the way, it is a question of finding the room and finding the date and that is the reason it has taken a little time. I will go through the system, show the system, get some officials in and take everybody through it. I know that the cost of that will be that I will have a whole load of Peers designing the system. In that last debate, I could hear how enthusiastic a number of Peers are to help me. I enjoy hearing all the questions and issues raised, not least by the two people who used to sit in my chair in the department: the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. These are complicated issues of delivery. Will noble Lords forgive me if I do not go through them? If I started, I would spend hours going through these delivery issues. On 3 November, we will have a chance to go through them. We are trying to deal with the legislative stuff here. I will pick up the specifics. I will not go through some of the real detail of the delivery here.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000208"></a>Let me move on to housing support, which is clearly a critical part of universal credit because it ensures that claimants receive a single payment to cover a range of needs rather than the current confusing patchwork of benefits and tax credits. Bluntly, taking housing out of that would leave a huge hole in the concept of the universal credit. The support must be affordable to the taxpayer. We have probably had enough discussions on the reforms to housing benefit.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para149"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000209"></a>Clearly, paying universal credit through a single agency will reduce administration costs and simplify the experience for claimants.</p>

I do not know that it is always clearly more efficient to centralise. There are times when that can create inefficiencies because, as we know, some claimants have very complex personal circumstances, and it is very difficult to understand those without more local knowledge and without meeting people and talking them through. Could the Minister give us a bit of evidence for his assertion?</p>

<p><a name="11102047000211"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0001.htm_spnew59"></a><a name="11102047000408"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, I think that I should probably explain my assertion rather than give evidence for it. I used the word "payment" very carefully. There are real issues about when and how you collect the information and who you collect it from. I was trying to avoid some of this because it is complicated, but one of the most important things about universal credit, which we have discovered as we do the feedback, is that going on to universal credit is an opportunity to change attitudes. That is one of the findings that surprised us most. People think, "This is what I used to do-now it is new, and I have to change my behaviours". It is an opportunity.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para150"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000212"></a>The question that we are looking at now-and this is just an example of the point that the noble Lord raises-is how we deliver that transformation best.

What are the intermediaries that we can use? With regard to documents, we can use ID assurance through the post office and through the local Jobcentre Plus. We can use the local authorities. How we combine those tentacles out into the community and into our claimant base is clearly something that we are working extraordinarily hard on.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para151"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000213"></a>We have a payment method, which we will put it together and simplify, and then regularise how we maintain knowledge of people, both on a database and on face-to-face contact. We need to know at what point you need the direct face-to-face contact and what point you go on to purely electronic means. You do not have to have a computer nowadays-you can have phone and apps and various things. As we move forward there is a real complexity, and if I start on this subject I will make noble Lords very fed up, but I do not want noble Lords to think that I am blind to this area.</p>

Amendment 48B would effectively provide for the housing costs element to be implemented at a later date than the other parts of universal credit.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para152"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000216"></a>We are committed to ensuring a smooth transition from housing benefit, guided by principles of protecting claimants and ensuring business efficiency. Amendment 119 would mean that any claimants moving on to universal credit in the first few years after it is introduced would then need to go through a second migration process when their housing support transferred in October 2017. Furthermore, to avoid significant complexity we would have to amend the housing benefit legislation to align housing benefit with universal credit; for example, by aligning the treatment of income. I cannot accept the noble Lord's amendment. As we do not believe that it is desirable to delay the incorporation of housing support into universal credit, we certainly would not want to introduce such a delay for pension credit. Our plans will ensure continuity of support for pensioners.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para153"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000217"></a>Amendment 53B would specify that housing benefit, currently delivered by local authorities, would be abolished from October 2017. We have no intention of specifying in primary legislation the dates on which particular benefits will be abolished. We are currently developing our strategy for migrating claimants to universal credit. This involves more than 18 million existing awards of benefits and tax credits. We need to ensure that we have the flexibility to implement these changes properly, with due regard to staff and claimants alike. Housing benefit will only be abolished once all claimants have successfully been migrated to universal credit or pension credit.</p>

We will build on the best of what we do currently to deliver the new service, taking the opportunity to modernise and improve, to deliver better efficiency for the taxpayer and better service for claimants.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para155"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000219"></a>On the question of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, about HMT's risk register, as was discussed earlier today in Questions in the Chamber, there is no specific HMT risk register which tracks projects. HMT works closely with colleagues in the Cabinet Office's Major Projects Authority to monitor the progress of all major projects. Clearly, universal credit is on the Government's major projects portfolio, which is essentially a compilation of the high-risk and high-value projects, covering 200 major projects with a total value in excess of £300 billion. The Major Projects Authority has been involved with universal credit right from the start of the process in 2010. As well as providing challenge through assurance reviews, it is in involved in various levels of governance and is indeed represented on the programme board.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para156"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000220"></a>As we develop the detailed design, we will continue to work collaboratively with local authorities to develop their role, particularly in relation to local and face-to-face delivery. Although, as I said earlier, many claimants will handle their universal credit claim online, we will continue to provide a face-to-face service. We are looking at these issues as part of the end-to-end delivery service rather than in isolation. We are also working with local authorities in Scotland and CoSLA is represented on our senior stakeholder group-in response to the question of the noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy.</p>

<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC158"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>programme to detail the resource requirements for universal credit and the single fraud investigation service. As we work through the detail, we will continue to work closely with local authorities to consider the impact on existing staff. Similarly, Amendment 71B would require DWP to compensate local authorities for any costs incurred owing to the transfer of support for housing costs to DWP. We are working with DCLG, the devolved Administrations and the local authority associations to bracket the full impact of these changes, but we have every intention of complying with the spirit of the new burdens doctrine set out by the Cabinet Office earlier this year, which states that any new burdens on local authorities must be fully funded by the relevant department. We will certainly not seek to impose any undue burdens on local taxpayers.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para158"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000226"></a>Finally, Amendment 103A would require us to consult local authorities and other interested parties on the removal of prosecution powers from authorities administering housing benefit or council tax benefit. We are already consulting fully on these measures. We have recently conducted a consultation exercise seeking local authorities' views which will inform the design of the new single fraud investigation service. The consultation paper outlined a number of options which would result in different implementation and running costs. Once an option has been chosen and design work begins, we will be in a position to calculate the costs and other impacts.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000227"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, questioned me about the support for those who will not be able to access the online offer. Clearly, we will be developing a variety of ways into the system for people who have different capabilities. I am myself particularly worried about those who may have learning disabilities and are not used to using computers. We need to ensure that people in that category, who may have registered representatives, are addressed. We are addressing those issues. It is an important point which I fully accept.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para160"></a>

The central problem is that Clause 140 allows the Minister to bring various parts of the universal credit system into play at different times. The only addition these two changes suggest is that there should be a review of housing before we do so or take a decision on it. He has conceded that we have a review of housing and that that ends in 2013. However, 2013 is, of course, the date on which we are bringing in the universal credit, so any conclusions from that housing review cannot be brought into play before that.</p>

The review that we have is of the impact of our LHA, shared accommodation and other changes. It is not a kind of total, all-encompassing review. I did not mean to oversell it in its breadth; I was selling it in its depth in terms of an econometric analysis of what happens in the market when you make changes. That is what I was selling as the best piece of work since Boadicea, whose impact on housing in London was even more negative than some noble Lords claim ours is. There is not a read across from that review to what we shall be doing in universal credit.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000235"></a>I thank the Minister for the proposed IT seminar. I was not entirely clear whether it will be a private briefing for noble Lords or a side step in the consideration of the Bill. Many organisations are, of course, extremely interested in how we are going to set up the IT system, and I do not know whether it is an open meeting or whether, at least, its proceedings could be provided to the wider world. Speaking only for myself, I may not be sufficiently IT literate to understand everything the Minister will say on that occasion but others might. It would be useful if those who have an interest in this field can also, either at the meeting or after the meeting, participate in those discussions. Clarification of that would be helpful. For the moment, I withdraw my amendment.</p>

The good news for the Minister is that this amendment does not cost any money; in fact, it is going to save a great deal. It is about the direct payment of housing costs support to the tenant instead of, as is the current case, payment of these benefits to the landlord. The Government are keen for tenants who receive housing benefit, local housing allowance in the private rented sector or, in future, the housing costs element in universal credit to be given the rent money directly and then to take responsibility for passing it on to their landlord. This would increase tenants' understanding of the need for budgeting and financial discipline in the home and help them cope with rent payments if and when they get a job. However, it seems that those affected by this proposition-tenants,

<a name="111020-gc0001.htm_para163"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000239"></a>A recent survey by the research consultancy Policis found that 93 per cent of tenants in the social rented sector wanted housing benefit to be paid direct to  their landlord. It seems that those on benefit prefer the option of knowing that their rent has been paid, allowing them to budget for other expenditure in the knowledge that their home is secure. Citizens Advice, the Money Advice Trust, Shelter, Crisis and Homeless Link all oppose the idea of tenants being denied the right to choose for their rent to be paid directly to their landlord. These organisations are concerned to ensure that tenants do not fall into arrears and face the threat of eviction. The Tenants and Residents Organisations of England-TAROE-strongly support giving tenants the right to chose.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000240"></a>Organisations representing landlords-the Residential Landlords Association, the National Housing Federation, the housing federations in Scotland and Wales, the British Property Federation, the National Federation of ALMOs and others-are worried that rent arrears will escalate as tenants prioritise other debts, often to less tolerant creditors, including obnoxious loan sharks, who are likely to be major beneficiaries if benefits for rent are paid direct to tenants. If rents are paid monthly, the cash in hand for tenants can easily exceed £500, a huge sum for those struggling to make ends meet on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000241"></a>Recent figures from LSL Property Services show that rent arrears in the private rented sector are already on the increase. Following a pilot scheme by the London and Quadrant Housing Trust, which saw arrears rise markedly when housing benefit was paid direct to the tenant, the National Housing Federation has calculated that on a national basis arrears of £320 million would be likely to accumulate as a consequence of this change. The federation also calculates that the extra admin costs of individualising the payment of rent to tenants would add a further £100 million per annum to the costs. Collecting rent from each tenant to whom the benefits had been paid is clearly a more laborious process than receiving it from the local authority.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000242"></a>There is an even more serious consequence of a system that fails to pay benefits direct to landlords, which is that many landlords in the private rented sector are becoming increasingly reluctant to let to any tenant on benefits for fear that they will not receive the rent. Like it or not, we now depend on the private rented sector to accommodate many low-income households, and the refusal to pay the local housing allowance directly to the private landlord is a huge discouragement to the sector. I know that the Minister has been looking at the level of arrears that must accumulate before the rent money can be paid direct to landlords in the hope of being able to reassure landlords that if arrears are mounting up rent direct to the landlord will be possible, but even a few weeks of arrears, which will be very hard to recover subsequently, can be a serious deterrent to landlords who are already reluctant to let to people on benefit.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000243"></a>The Council of Mortgage Lenders is a significant body that supports my amendment. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11102047000322"></a>"For social landlords the certainty of benefit payments that reflect actual rents has been important to their ability to secure private investment at highly competitive rates and ensure that they can maximise their capacity to build much needed social housing. This principle should be carried over into the new Universal Credit".</p>

<p><a name="11102047000299"></a>It goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11102047000323"></a>"Institutional investors place great importance on cash flow underpinned by direct payments and the view of rating agencies is key to the continued success of this type of investment ... It will not be sufficient to maintain the confidence and commitment of lenders and investors to leave the important elements around housing credit to secondary legislation. There are potential implications for existing loan agreements ... The existing levels of rent direct payment have been a major factor for funders in offering the social housing sector preferential loan rates. It is estimated that these benefit the sector by some £500m pa".</p>

<p><a name="11102047000300"></a>Losing those preferential rates at £500 million per annum, added to the direct costs of arrears and extra administration of £420 million per annum, gets us to nearly £1 billion a year for this policy.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000244"></a>Amendment 49 would simply enable tenants to opt for or consent to the housing cost element of their universal credit payment going straight to the landlord. We know that the technical, mechanical process of separating out the housing element from the rest is not a problem, since the Minister has already made it clear that payment for rent will indeed go straight to the landlord when the tenant has gone into arrears, as it will for tenants over pension age who wish this. Clearly, there is no logistical reason for not giving tenants the opportunity to choose this option. Surely, it is right and proper to allow tenants to manage their finances and protect themselves against arrears and the potential horrors of eviction though the rent being taken care of directly by the state paying their rent money to the landlord.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000245"></a>Some will confidently choose to handle the rent themselves, and those who opt not to at the outset would be able to change their minds at a later date, but the great majority would, it seems, wish their rent to be paid direct to the landlord. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations tells me that 96 per cent of housing association tenants in London currently choose that method of payment, and they will all be adversely affected by the change.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000246"></a>Last month, the Minister announced a set of demonstration projects to look at financial support and budgeting advice for tenants, including mechanisms for repaying arrears and instigating payments to landlords when arrears build up. This is a very helpful initiative from the Minister. I know that it will look at how tenants with bank accounts could use direct debits to pay out what is paid in for rent.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000247"></a>The Scottish Federation makes the good point that the direct debit system cannot guarantee that a landlord will receive payment. In fact, there is a risk that households on constrained incomes who have bank accounts and set up a direct debit for rent payments could find themselves with insufficient funds to meet the payment on the due date. If this happens, in addition to the rent arrears that they will accrue, they will also face significant bank charges for the missed direct debit, especially if the landlord tries to get the

There is a significant risk that both rent arrears and general indebtedness will increase among tenants of social housing.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000248"></a>On the question of whether we could get round the problem by giving good advice, the Money Advice Trust's chief executive Joanna Elson has said of the proposal in my amendment:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11102047000324"></a>"We feel that this would enable many tenants to avoid housing benefit arrears and thus tackle their debts and manage their money wisely".</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000249"></a>The helpful initiative that the Minister has started will produce important information and possibly help us come to different conclusions about whether rent should be paid direct to landlords before universal credit is introduced in October 2013. The hazard with carrying on in the mean time on the course currently set is that it creates anxiety and uncertainty for housing association and their lenders, which inevitably impact on the terms on which housing associations are able to operate. It will cause distress and concern among the tenants themselves. I hope that the Minister can provide a level of reassurance at this stage in the legislation's development that we will be able to restore confidence to tenants and landlords. I look forward to his comments and beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000250"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="11102047000425"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I rise to support Amendment 49, tabled by my noble friend Lord Best. I understand the Government's argument that they wish universal credit payments to mimic those of a wage or salary for paid employment. That sounds very sensible but in the world to be created by this legislation it really cannot work. I understand that clients officially recognised as vulnerable will be able to have direct payments to the landlord. As my noble friend said, pensioners would have that facility. Perhaps the Minister will expand a little more on the meaning of "vulnerable" in this context. My fear is always that anyone who can walk would not be categorised as vulnerable. How would people with mental health difficulties be assessed?</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000251"></a>If claimant income was in a steady state, there might be an argument in support of the Government's position in terms of the transition to employment but, in the context of the changes and swingeing cuts envisaged in this legislation, including housing benefit payments in with universal credit payments to the claimants must surely be a hostage to fortune. The Government understandably do not want the prospect of losing direct rent payments to act as a disincentive to work. However, I imagine that most people who move into work will in fact continue to be entitled to some universal credit and housing benefit support. They would be able to continue receiving direct payments.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000252"></a>Those who move into work on a wage level lifting them out of universal credit would of course be in  a somewhat different position. I hope that they might be able to deal with their rent and even to organise  a direct debit with sufficient funds in the bank on a regular basis to cover it. That is certainly not the case for anybody going through the benefit changes over the next five years.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000253"></a>I understand the Government's concern about the transition into work on various different levels of income but for claimants on the receiving end of benefit cuts-for example, due to reduced disability  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>support, a move from ESA to JSA, housing penalties due to under-occupation or the rent being above the 30th percentile-the first priority must surely be to secure a roof over their heads. These people will be hit very hard whatever the transitional payments may achieve in the short term. If people get into serious rent arrears, which for the great majority seems inevitable, and they receive their housing benefit with their universal credit, they will be under threat of eviction or already homeless and in no position at all to find work. That is my biggest worry about this raft of reforms. It is very hard to imagine that claimants are going to cope at all, let alone have the confidence and emotional energy to apply for jobs. That is quite apart from the problems that they will have affording clothing and fares to go for an interview or to work.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000254"></a>I remember some years ago talking to a group of unemployed people about why they were apparently unable to move into work. They raised practical problems, such as, "I sold my trousers and my jacket; I no longer have a tie", and they would have to go shopping. In future this sort of practical problem will be infinitely worse. The CAB service has sent me a case study that illustrates the point perfectly precisely. A client, again not surprisingly with a mental health condition and under the care of the community mental health team, had asked for her housing benefit to be paid directly to the landlord. This had been refused and the result was that she went into arrears and had all sorts of problems. Eventually, of course, it was agreed that her rent would be paid direct to the landlord but she cannot now deal with those arrears, even if her weekly rent is covered, and the result is that the landlord is pressing to evict her.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000255"></a>I feel that this is going to apply to tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people all over the country, so I see this as a fundamentally important amendment to this Bill. In other cases sent to me by the CAB the same issues arise; vulnerability to debt, problems of budget management, often because of mental health problems and threats of eviction. The reality is that direct payments to landlords present the one amendment that really could ensure a roof over the head of claimants as no other amendment really can. Even if people lose their electricity and their gas, as one imagines will happen, if they can stay in their home that will be something.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000256"></a>If we look at the perspective of the landlord, as my noble friend Lord Best did, direct payments are likely to be the only incentive for landlords to take on benefit claimants. A quick look through the advertisements for rental accommodation confirms the considerable percentage of affordable flats and houses for rent which simply state "No DSS". Everybody must be very familiar with that. Since direct payments to landlords were abolished tenants' and landlords' associations alike have consistently campaigned for their reinstatement. The Government have recently agreed to give local authorities greater discretion to allow direct payments when landlords are bringing rents down. I suppose that is something. However, more general availability of payments would increase the supply of rented accommodation and would therefore provide downward pressure on rents, which is of course what we all want. On the contrary, by reducing the supply of flats for

The concern is that the claimant will be caught between these forces and find it impossible to cope, let alone to find work.</p>

I go back to the very helpful research report published by the department, <I>Perceptions of W</I><I>elfare </I><I>R</I><I>eform and Universal Credit</I><I>.</I> I congratulate the department on conducting this research. What came out of that was that people very much welcomed the idea of a one-stop shop, although, of course, as we heard in the first sitting will not be one stop because council tax benefit will have to be claimed elsewhere. However, there was also concern that a single benefit may increase the risk to claimants if something goes wrong, either with the calculation or payment as all their eggs will be in one basket.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000258"></a>I want to prefigure the discussions we will have on Clause 97 about joint payments. This has exacerbated the position of couples where all the money is to go to one partner and that partner may not be the person responsible for paying the rent or meeting the housing costs. It is another reason why we should support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Best.</p>
<h5><a name="11102047000343"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="11102047000259"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="11102047000427"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> My Lords, I strongly support the amendment and wish to underline two points. First, if the great problem in the housing market is a shortage of affordable housing, then by doing something to social landlords and private developers which not only affects the certainty of their cash flow but also seriously undermines their credit worthiness-and therefore their ability to raise money to develop new houses-we would cut ourselves off and shoot ourselves in the foot. They are the only source of new affordable housing if the Government are not prepared to spend any more directly.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000260"></a>Secondly, we have always set up direct debits for paying our mortgage costs or our rent, and the kind of bank accounts that most of us have allow us to go into slight overdraft if the falling of the payments is out of synch. A large proportion of people who exist on benefits either do not have bank accounts or, more frequently, they have bank accounts which do not allow direct debit or, if they do allow direct debit, do not allow agreed overdrafts. It is more difficult to manage your money if you are in that situation with your financial service provider. It is patronising to say to the poorest part of our community, "You must manage your own money better", when they do not have the opportunities that we who are better off have in managing our money.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000262"></a>Our prime concern should be with the tenants. I accept the objective-trying to expand the rights and responsibilities of tenants is a good objective-but this is a major social experiment that we are plonking on top of a complex administrative exercise, as has been mentioned. For that reason, we must be guarded in what we are doing because it is the tenants who will suffer; it is they who will have the stress of getting into arrears. The housing associations in some respects  will look after themselves-they will put in processes to overcome this although there may be some disadvantages-and it is the tenants who we should be most concerned about.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000263"></a>I know the Minister has already initiated consultative exercises and we have to see what conclusions they arrive at in regard to our concerns on this issue. However, as has already been stated, we know that  15 per cent of tenants of housing associations, for example, have no bank accounts whatever. That problem also has to be overcome before we can go through this process. We have a great many doubts about what is happening in the housing benefit offices, who will be doing the liaison there and how tenants will sort out their problems if they get into arrears. Obviously there will be a great deal of pressure on the housing associations. Given the economic pressures we face, they will obviously expand-as they are doing now-the welfare benefit advice they already give.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000264"></a>I repeat that in the future clearly we should have respect for the rights of the tenants, but do not overlook the huge burden of the task you are putting on the system by not having this protection.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000266"></a>I agree that it is an important principle to cultivate people's independence as far as one can; it is an important consideration to keep in mind. However, there are clearly others here; I am worried about the impact on the market as well. I visited private accommodation in Redbridge in London with a health visitor and I was struck by the appalling quality of much of what was provided to families. My concern is that if one shrinks the market, those who find it hard to let to the general public may continue renting out to those on benefits. Once you make it as attractive as possible to landlords to provide accommodation to people on benefits, they are perhaps more likely to invest in their accommodation to gain such clients. I saw a lavatory and shower arrangement combined in one place, damp walls and landlords who clearly failed entirely to take proper care of the accommodation they were providing. That is a concern.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000267"></a>I am also worried about families where there is an addiction to alcohol, gambling or drugs. Money may be spent on those habits and their children will be without a home because of that. If any money is saved through this particular methodology I would, of course, welcome it and hope that it might provide an opportunity to meet some of the concerns we have elsewhere in the Bill. We could perhaps cope with the vulnerable groups about which we are concerned but for which there simply does not seem to be the money available to help.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000268"></a>I would appreciate a reminder of where the Government are going with bed and breakfast accommodation for families. The previous Government put a lot of work into taking families out of bed and breakfast accommodation. I dare say that Crisis, or some organisation like that, might write to me with a reminder of the situation. However, if the Minister has time, I would appreciate a reminder of where the Government are moving with that now. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000269"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="11102047000430"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, experience leads us to conclude that the most appropriate approach is for tenants to have the choice as to how housing support is to be paid: to the tenant or to the landlord. I say that notwithstanding that the Minister will doubtless remind us that we introduced the local housing allowance and the arrangements which have generated a number of problems.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000270"></a>Incidentally, a parallel issue arises in respect of support for mortgage interest, which we discussed at our previous two meetings. Will the Minister confirm how this is to be paid: to the lender, as now, or to the borrower? Currently a variety of arrangements are possible: for tenants who have not yet moved on to the local housing allowance, there is a choice of direct or to-the-tenant payments; for those on the local housing allowance, it is generally to the tenant but with safeguards for vulnerable tenants; for local authority tenants, there is a credit into their rent accounts; and for RSLs there are direct payments. We know that the Minister intends that, under the universal credit, the default position for tenants in the private rented sector and those living in social housing will be that support for working-age claimants will be paid to the tenant.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000271"></a>Incidentally-a couple of noble Lords referred to this-the Minister did experiment or is experimenting with direct payments in the private rented sector in exchange for lower rents. Perhaps he would update us on how that is all working and on the parameters of those arrangements. It is understood that the plans for existing pensioners who will receive housing support are that there will be direct payments, although this will involve a change of sorts for local authority tenants. New pensioners will have the choice of direct payment to the landlord or to receive their payments directly.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000272"></a>The difficulties with what is proposed have been articulated in this debate. They centre on the risks of rent arrears, with the associated problems of increased personal debt; more evictions and the rise in homelessness; an increased reluctance of private-sector landlords to let to tenants who would rely on benefit; potentially increased financing costs for RSLs where their benefit income stream may be less secure-I think the noble Lord, Lord Best, put that figure at £500 million, a staggering figure. There would be increased transaction costs for local authorities in moving away from the direct-crediting system. The NHF modelling suggests something like £100 million in additional transaction costs across the sector. As the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, said, more than 15 per cent of local authority tenants and 13 per cent of housing association tenants do not have bank accounts and could not, at least initially, pay by direct debit.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000273"></a>What is the Government's position on rent arrears? Shelter's research indicated that the introduction of the local housing allowance and payments to tenants has led to increased arrears. Do the Government accept that analysis, or what is their contrary evidence? For vulnerable, poor people and those with limited financial flexibility, is it not the case that there will sometimes be a temptation to dip into the housing support funds for a family emergency, a cooker on its last legs, new shoes for the kids and so on? With the intolerable pressure of juggling inadequate resources, made worse by this Government's benefit cuts and staying away from loan sharks and pay-day lenders, who would not be tempted? Of course, direct payments do not solve the inadequacy of resources but they prioritise the security of the home, and tenants should have the choice to do this.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000274"></a>The Minister will be aware that the Localism Bill is abolishing the housing revenue account subsidy scheme. We support that approach and up-front settlement of debt, the sustainability of which is based on a 30-year business plan. Obviously such plans have to take account of voids, rent levels, rent arrears and bad debts. To what extent has the DWP been engaged in discussion with CLG about the possible consequences of changing the benefit arrangements? It is a fact that for RSLs the payment of benefit direct has been a crucial component in securing private finance for new build. This is even more important when reliance is being placed on intermediate rents to fund new housing development. What assessment has been made of the market's reaction to the universal credit proposals?</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000275"></a>In a speech to the National Housing Federation annual conference in September, the Minister said that he was determined about the introduction of universal credit and that direct payment to tenants did not undermine the financial stability of the housing sector. He said that he remained utterly convinced that there were mechanisms available that would allow the Government to introduce a single universal payment that includes housing costs while also providing protection for the sector. Perhaps the Minister will take the opportunity to share with us the work that is currently being undertaken and what he sees as the key features of the solution. It is understood that those include prioritised direct debits and escrow accounts. What sort of priority would these arrangements give landlords over other creditors of the tenants, especially the banks? Other noble Lords have raised that issue.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000276"></a>Current arrangements to ensure that particularly vulnerable tenants in the private rented sector have their benefit paid direct to the landlord-some 11 per cent of claimants-result from determinations made locally. How will that work within a centralised universal credit system? If special arrangements are to be made to support vulnerable individuals, how will such individuals, if not self selecting, be identified?</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000277"></a>Finally, we know that the Government argue that payment to tenants is about promoting financial responsibility and breaking welfare dependency. But why is the choice of a tenant to have their housing support paid directly to landlords not a financially responsible decision?</p>

<p><a name="11102047000278"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="11102047000431"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, one of the key principles of our welfare reforms is to make the whole experience of claiming benefits as close as possible to the experience of receiving a wage or salary. The choices available to working households do not include opting for their employer to pay the landlord directly. I am not convinced by the argument that so-called tenant choice is genuine choice. Effective choice exists only when the balance of power is equal between tenants and landlords. When power is in the hands of landlords, tenant choice becomes landlord choice, and that, of course, leads to the situation we have at the moment where 95 per cent of claimants reputedly choose to have their housing benefit paid direct to the landlord.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000279"></a>A gulf has opened up in the social rented sector between the experience of being unemployed and the experience of being in work. That is why this Government are absolutely committed to making a single universal credit payment per household, wherever possible. I repeat the statement that I made to the National Housing Federation last month. I am determined that the introduction of universal credit, and therefore direct payments to tenants, does not undermine the financial stability of the housing sector. I assure noble Lords that we have been in constant and regular dialogue with the DCLG to make sure that we are proceeding along a path that does not undermine the financial stability of the housing sector.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000280"></a>The switch to direct payments to tenants will be completely new for around 20 per cent of tenants. The remaining 80 per cent of tenants will see no change at all or are already partially managing their rent payments themselves. Landlords can continue to rent to them without a problem. Vulnerable people, around 10 per cent of social sector tenants, will continue to have their rent paid direct to the landlord. This can include those with significant debts. I know that noble Lords are concerned about what will happen to people in this position. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, asked me how they would be selected and identified. Clearly, we will develop procedures to identify these people and take steps to carry on paying the landlords.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000281"></a>I announced last month our intention to commission a set of demonstration projects which we hope to launch in June next year. They will test some of the key elements of how direct payment of their housing costs to working-age tenants will work across all tenure types. They will help gather the information needed to get the final design of any safeguards in universal credit right. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, asked a series of questions on how it will work. We will trial things such as escrow accounts, detailed budgeting support and so on, how one would switch payments and arrears and how one would recover those arrears. We would look at how one protects the interests of both tenant and landlord so that we do not have a question over the security of the cash flow of the housing associations.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000282"></a>I am absolutely conscious of the importance of this. I monitor closely the attitudes of the rating agencies and banks, and I am absolutely conscious of the need to maintain confidence. These demonstration

<p><a name="11102047000285"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="11102047000434"></a>Lord Freud:</b> That is exactly the structure we need, but how does one find a way? It may be an escrow account in which that payment is protected. That is what we are going to develop. I will resist the siren sound of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. I have made a very firm statement here about being determined not to see the financial position of housing associations undermined. That is a very firm statement of intent. I think that is probably enough without further elaboration.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000286"></a>I would like to pick up the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, about what people will really do when they have sold their tie and their jacket. I remind her that we are bringing in the universal credit processes of incentivisation of individuals alongside a massive welfare-to-work programme in the work programme. The price we as taxpayers and as a state are prepared to pay to help people in difficulty back into the workplace is more of a factor than the figures that we have been prepared to pay in the past. We are prepared to pay providers a reward of up to £14,000 to get the hardest to help back into the workplace. That is the kind of money that they can play with and it will get a lot of ties and jackets if that is the factor that is stopping somebody going to work. That is exactly why we are prepared to ramp up the reward.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000287"></a>Let me finish by saying that the sector has shown real enthusiasm for these demonstration projects, which is our way of finding out how to do this. We are looking for six, and we have had a lot of responses. When I last looked-this is a couple of weeks out of date-we had already had 40 expressions of interest. There is real enthusiasm in the industry to get this right, and I am determined to get both what we need in universal credit and what we need for our housing industry sorted out, and we are doing it through these projects. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000288"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="11102047000435"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> On the vital work incentives-I am sure this is a discussion I should have heard and missed earlier-if the Minister could send me a note or point me towards the research into how effective enabling people to pay their rent is in terms of helping them get into employment, it would be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="11102047000289"></a><b><a name="111020-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="11102047000436"></a>Lord Best:</b> I shall make three quick points in conclusion. First, the well-being of tenants is very much what has motivated the long list of charities that are primarily concerned with the welfare of tenants. They do not believe that this is helpful or useful or will get people into work and do those good things. Those charities  


<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC171"></a><b>20 Oct 2011 : Column GC171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>include the representative of the tenants-the Tenants and Residents Organisation of England-which does not agree that this is for the good of residents. This alliance of organisations, with the Council of Mortgage Lenders alongside Shelter and Crisis, is all as one, so I pray in aid a very large body of expertise, a lot of it very specifically with the views of tenants foremost in their minds.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000290"></a>Secondly, although it will be possible for those who are classified as vulnerable to have their rents paid direct to the landlord, bearing in mind future financial pressures on tenants and the difficulties of organising your finances with the complexities of things such as direct debits, the estimate that it will apply to 10 per cent of all of those in social housing sounds remarkably low.</p>

<a name="111020-gc0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="11102047000291"></a>Finally, I am sure that everyone would welcome pilots and practical ways of looking at the issue on the ground to discover how things might be done better.

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="11102030000003"></a><b><a name="111020-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="11102030000044"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Howell of Guildford):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (William Hague) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="11102030000004"></a>I wish to inform the House that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, together with the Ministry  of Defence and the Department for International Development, is today publishing the tenth progress report on developments in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="11102030000005"></a>Former President Rabbani's death at the hands of a suicide bomber on 20 September has drawn worldwide condemnation. It is too early to draw definitive conclusions on the long-term effect his death will have on the peace process, but it may prove significant. Much will depend on his successor as chair of the High Peace Council and the continuing efforts of the Afghan Government to achieve national unity and a political solution to Afghanistan's problems.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="11102030000006"></a>On 13 September, as part of their campaign to undermine the peace process, insurgents attacked the US Embassy, ISAF Headquarters and an Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) base in Kabul. The attacks were not successful and neither the US Embassy nor ISAF HQ perimeters were breached. Eleven civilians were tragically killed in the attacks. However the ANSF led an effective response: they successfully neutralised the threat and demonstrated a high degree of operational competence.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="11102030000007"></a>With UK support, the Government of Afghanistan continue to improve their delivery of basic services. The new National Priority Programme for Local Governance will help local government institutions deliver improved basic services to communities, while a UK-funded Afghan Government programme is bringing opportunities for licit livelihoods to more people. Both will help to reinforce successful security transition. The IMF and the Government of Afghanistan continue to work towards agreeing a new programme of support, and we are hopeful agreement will be reached this autumn, allowing the UK and the international community to resume routine funding to the Afghan Government.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="11102030000008"></a>The insurgency is resilient and, as demonstrated by the recent high-profile attacks in Kabul, remains a threat. However, such incidents rarely achieve their tactical effect and are designed to create a perception of increased violence and instability that it is not reflective of the progress being made in much of the country. We should not allow these attacks to distort the many examples of significant security improvements or overshadow continued progress to governance and development objectives. There remain many challenges ahead but there is also much encouraging progress.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="11102030000011"></a>I am today announcing the publication of the Renewables Obligation Banding Review. This consultation looks at the levels of support renewable technologies will receive under the renewables obligation from 2013 to 2017 (from 2014 for offshore wind).</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="11102030000012"></a>We need a surge of investment in low carbon energy sources to help get us off the fossil fuel price hook, keep the lights on, and keep bills down. The package proposed in the banding review will bring forward investment, securing the UK's position as a global leader in the renewable energy sector, and supporting the transition to a green economy.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="11102030000013"></a>The UK has some of best renewable resources in the world, and the proposals in the consultation aim to make the most of those resources. The package of measures we propose will ensure we keep on track to meet our 2020 renewable energy target, in line with our vision for renewables published in July's UK renewable energy roadmap.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="11102030000014"></a>At the same time, we are paying attention to consumer bills. It is vital that our support for renewable electricity both encourages investment and represents value for money for consumers. So the banding levels we are proposing will cost less than if we remained with the current levels of support, while delivering more renewable energy.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="11102030000015"></a>To do this, our proposals encourage the most efficient use of UK renewable resource. We are proposing to remove excess support from technologies that would be overcompensated by the current levels, and maximise deployment of the cheapest renewable technologies, such as energy from waste and co-firing.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="11102030000016"></a>For offshore wind, where the UK is the international market leader, we are working closely with the supply chain, developers and finance community to drive down costs by around 40 per cent by 2020. As part of that trajectory, we are reducing support in this banding review by 5 per cent in 2015, and another 5 per cent in 2016, ensuring that consumers benefit from these cost reductions, and ensuring that we are able to maximise deployment of this key technology-providing the potential for a 18GW market by 2020.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="11102030000017"></a>We should not be supporting inefficient generation, and our proposed support for onshore wind will target only the most cost effective onshore wind farm deployment, encouraging developers to build in places where the wind is strongest.</p>

We are also maintaining current levels of support for dedicated new build biomass until 2016 in order to encourage shovel-ready projects to begin construction, securing significant investment and green jobs.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="11102030000019"></a>This consultation also reiterates the coalition's agreement to promote marine technologies, recognising that marine energy has the potential to meet a large proportion of our electricity demand by 2050. Our proposals provide a clear signal that we want to see large scale, commercial deployment of wave and tidal technologies in UK waters, cementing the UK's position as the global leader in this technology.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="11102030000021"></a>The next Agriculture and Fisheries Council is on Thursday 20 and Friday 21 October, in Luxembourg.  I shall represent the UK on agriculture matters on Thursday, accompanied by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Agriculture and Food (Jim Paice). On Friday my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment and Fisheries (Richard Benyon) will be representing the United Kingdom on the fisheries items. Richard Lochhead MSP and Michelle O'Neil MLA and Alun Davies AM will also attend.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="11102030000022"></a>Council will deal with agricultural business on the first day. It will open with a presentation by the Commission of the new proposals for CAP reform before member states are given the opportunity to give initial reactions during two full table rounds. The first table round will focus on the proposals for direct payments to farmers and rural development. The second table round will cover the more technical aspects of the common market organisation and control measures.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="11102030000023"></a>There are two other agriculture items on the main agenda. The first relates to distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Union. This returns to council after discussion in September, with a revised Commission proposal that now has a social policy as well as CAP legal base. The second item relates to the international wine organisation (OIV), that has its annual meeting later in October. The Commission wishes to lead for the EU in an area of exclusive competence and will propose a mandate for it to do so.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="11102030000024"></a>Finally on agricultural issues, there is an AoB item on the welfare of laying hens. The EU agreed to phase out battery cages for hens for egg production some years ago and the deadline for implementation is the end of 2011. The Commission will present data on how far member states have progressed towards compliance.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="11102030000029"></a>I can today announce that Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been awarded the Greater Anglia (Short) franchise.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="11102030000030"></a>The new franchise will begin operation on Sunday 5 February 2012. It will operate for 29 months (32 rail industry periods).</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="11102030000031"></a>Bids were received from Abellio Greater Anglia Limited (NV Nederlandse Spoorwegen), Eastern Railway Limited (Go-Ahead Group PLC), and Stagecoach Anglia Trains Limited (Stagecoach Group plc).</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="11102030000032"></a>Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been chosen  to run trains on the network, which operates across Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. The franchise will also play a significant role in transport for the London 2012 Games providing crucial services to the Olympic Park area.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="11102030000033"></a>The terms of the contract the Government have agreed with the winning bidder will deliver a series of improvements for passengers during the 29 month franchise.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="11102030000034"></a>These include providing better station and ticket facilities and measures to improve passenger information. A text messaging service to keep passengers informed if service disruption occurs will be introduced. New information desks will be provided at major stations including London Liverpool Street, Cambridge, Norwich, Ipswich and Stansted Airport.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="11102030000035"></a>The new franchise will make it easier for passengers to buy tickets, including:</p>
extending Oyster pay as you go between London Liverpool Street and all stations to Shenfield, and stations to Hertford East;improvements to ticket vending machines; and introducing mobile phone and print-at-home ticketing facilities.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="11102030000036"></a>Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has also committed to provide an additional 600 car park spaces (subject to planning approvals), more cycle storage facilities and deliver a number of other measures to improve the service to customers including deep cleaning of stations and trains.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="11102030000037"></a>The train company will take over station leases from Network Rail, taking on responsibility for all repairs and renewals at stations. This accords with the Government's overall franchise reform programme which advocates transfer of more responsibility for stations to train operators as the passenger-facing side of the rail industry.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="11102030000038"></a>To date, only overall figures for the performance of the franchise as a whole have been published. From the start of the new franchise, Abellio Greater Anglia Limited will start publishing a break down of punctuality figures by route giving passengers more transparency over the performance of the lines they use. The reliability requirements for the new franchise are also more demanding than the previous one.</p>

<a name="111020-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="11102030000039"></a>When the franchise is renewed again in July 2014, the contract is expected to be 15 years in length. This forthcoming franchise will provide the opportunity to seek further improvements for passengers. We also intend to draw on the work of Sir Roy McNulty in setting the terms of the franchise with the aim of reducing costs and improving efficiency.</p>

<a name="111020w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="11102029000006"></a>On 9 February 2011, the Chancellor announced a new commitment by the UK's biggest high street banks on lending expectations and capacity. As part of this commitment, the banks will make available appropriate capital and resources to support £190 billion of new credit to businesses in 2011, up from £179 billion in 2010. If demand exceeds this, the banks will lend more, including creating the balance sheet capacity necessary to do so. £76 billion of this lending capacity will be available to small and medium-sized enterprises. This is a 15 per cent increase on 2010 lending of £66 billion.</p>

We are only aware of one plan to conduct experiments in the UK relating to climate-related geo-engineering and that is part of the Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering (SPICE) project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Natural Environment Research Council, with support from the Science and Technology Facilities Council. As this is small scale and will not involve spraying anything into the atmosphere other than a small amount of water, this is not considered to be geo-engineering according to the definition laid out by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. A stage-gate advisory panel has been set up to ensure the project progresses safely and responsibly. Thus we believe SPICE will not contravene any international agreements.</p>

To support the NHS to develop the CNS workforce, the strategy sets out our intention to build the evidence base for the benefits and costs savings that CNSs can offer. This follows an independent report we published in December 2010 that showed that, in many scenarios, the costs of additional support roles are likely to be outweighed by the savings that can be achieved.</p>
