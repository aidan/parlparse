I agree with everything that she said about remembering the contribution of that generation. I had the honour of meeting Harry Patch on a visit to Ypres last year. Does she agree that those two survivors have played an amazing part in creating understanding about warfare and conflict, and in promoting peace and reconciliation through such things as visits to schools and numerous visits to veterans in Flanders? That being so, why cannot we also offer those gentlemen some sort of official recognition? Next month, they will celebrate their 111th and 113th birthdays, which even by the standards of your Lordships' House are great ages. Will my noble friend please use her influence to see whether something can be done fairly quickly to achieve that recognition?</p>

My noble friend and the whole House will know that national honours and awards are in the gift of the Sovereign and are always handled discreetly. It would be wrong to set a precedent by commenting further. I am sure that the House will also recall that a Statement was made on 27 June 2006 in another place in which the Government&#146;s plans to honour the World War I generation were laid out. It is important to remember that work is in hand to take further that idea and other ideas of how we should recognise those contributions.</p>

Obviously, these matters have to be dealt with extremely sensitively, and the wishes of the families have to be taken into account, which is why it might be appropriate to wait a little time following the death before holding such a service.</p>

It is right to say that we should not forget those who survive conflicts, as well as to remember those who have died. As far as concerns about being late to acknowledge the contribution of those such as the veterans whom we were talking about, there have been many acknowledgements, and the 90th remembrance service last year was a very fitting occasion to recognise the contribution of those who had served in the First World War.</p>

Of course, he is right to refer to the intermittent nature of wind energy, which means that there must be back-up capacity. However, as this House has frequently reminded me, that reinforces the need for a diversity of supply, which is why this Government have given their support to new nuclear and new coal under carbon capture and storage, as well as encouraging renewables. As for wind in general, we see onshore wind as having a critically important part to play in developing energy sources in this country.</p>

An announcement was made today by E.ON, which said that the first phase of the London Array project will take place later this year, which could generate power in time for the 2012 Olympics.

This replaces the fact that Wilton Park was going to different parts of the Foreign Office to get funding for different conferences, which had a huge labour and transactional cost to it. We hope that the provision of this core funding will allow the leadership of Wilton Park to go out and find new clients, so that it will be able to put itself on a much more stable footing for the long-term future.</p>

This is a very good example of soft power in British diplomacy, which the Foreign Office values a great deal but which the Treasury does not seem to understand. There are similar issues over Commonwealth scholarships and a range of other things. Can the Foreign Office have a much more constructive, broad dialogue with the Treasury about these soft-power elements in British diplomacy, which have been cut back so vigorously in recent years?

In the UK we have the examples of Ditchley and Chatham House here in London, which the noble Lord also knows well, and more globally we have things such as the World Economic Forum. But to succeed in this highly competitive world, even an institution such as Wilton Park needs to find the right niche with a sharpened mission and focus in terms of the kind of conferences it seeks to attract.

Will he also accept that we strongly support and welcome these moves to ensure the continuity of Wilton Park, which has been extremely well run? It is particularly valuable in bringing together representatives of some of the smaller nations of Europe and of the Commonwealth to discuss issues of common interest and to do that particularly valuable thing of not only promoting our own interests as a nation but also promoting the interlinking and global togetherness which will ensure stability and peace throughout the planet.</p>

I think that it could even hold a few more conferences on the Commonwealth. On the issue of Britain as a nation that networks effectively between small and big nations, between NGOs and Governments, between think tanks, and in the general debate on ideas in international affairs, Wilton Park is a critical part of the soft-power architecture of what makes Britain effective in the world.</p>

Police tactics and decisions on managing demonstrations are an operational matter for the independent judgment of chief officers of police. On some occasions, entry to Parliament has been limited to one of several access points. This may have led to some inconvenience. However, the police have kept the House authorities closely informed when access points have been restricted and when advance warning has been possible.</p>

This is the second time&#151;the previous time being 20 April&#151;that the police have been totally hoodwinked and outwitted by the demonstrators and freedom of access through the front door has therefore been denied to both Peers and Members of Parliament. This is not only a total denial of freedom of access, but a major security risk, with people sitting in front of Carriage Gates.

On some days the numbers have been very few; on some days they have been very large indeed. On the whole, however, these protests have been peaceful and well managed by police and the organisers.</p>

<a name="90512-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09051233000065"></a>There is an important point of principle here. As the Joint Committee on Human Rights says, while protests may be disruptive or inconvenient, the presumption should be in favour of protests taking place without state interference. These are very difficult things to handle. In controlling demonstrations, the police have to facilitate that lawful process, preserve the peace, uphold the law and prevent the commission of offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09051233000066"></a>Clearly, it is not right that access here should be limited&#151;it is absolutely wrong. However, the police have a difficult balancing act to perform and, so far, they have been doing that well. As I have said, it is a matter for the chief officers of police.</p>

The police are handling this as well as they are able. There has always been at least one access point available, if not more. I agree that it is difficult and unfortunate, but the police are handling a sensitive and difficult situation. There are 250,000 in the Tamil community, most of whom are in London.

Across the pavement there were a number of tapes or ribbons. Most of them were raised for me by very helpful police officers so that I could duck underneath them. Far from my access being impeded, it was actually easier than usual because there were fewer people on the pavement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09051233000086"></a>There has been a traumatic period during which the Ceylon Tamils have seen their families back home in great difficulty. I think that the goodwill in the Tamil community has been increased by the way the situation has been dealt with&#151;and that in no way removes the validity of the Question of the noble Lord, Lord Naseby.</p>

It seems to me that, while they have a lawful right to demonstrate, we have made huge efforts in this country to try to bring an end to fighting in Sri Lanka. I think we should be proud of that and I hope that the Tamils can see and understand that as well, because we have bent over backwards and done very well in trying to end the fighting there. However, they have a right to demonstrate and it is being handled well.</p>

It is not caused by the police but by the ridiculous roadworks at the end of Victoria Street and into Parliament Square. That, together with the Tamils, has made the problem a million times worse than it would otherwise have been.</p>

The fact is that, if we cannot get to Parliament, freedom of speech is fundamentally undermined.</p>

I accept that that access has not been untrammelled and that that is not good enough, but we have been able to get in. I go back to what I said: this is a very sensitive and difficult situation, and pragmatically I think that it has been handled extremely well. No doubt people who have broken the law will be charged and so on because, as I said, that is part of the police&#146;s job. They have to control demonstrations, facilitate lawful process, preserve the peace, uphold the law and prevent the commission of offences. If people do commit offences, the police take them to court.</p>

On Report, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, tabled an amendment to ensure that Parliament is given an opportunity to scrutinise any changes to the guiding principles set out in the <I>NHS Constitution</I>. In the government amendments that I bring forward now, we have accepted the principle of the amendment but suggest an alternative form of wording to ensure that it fits with the existing clauses. These amendments require the Secretary of State to make regulations, under the negative resolution procedure, to address any changes to the guiding principles set out in the <I>NHS Constitution</I>.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09051233000094"></a>Although they may look extensive, the amendments are minor and technical. They make it clear that regulations must be laid whether principles are changed as a result of the 10-yearly review of the constitution or as a result of more periodic revisions. To achieve that, they make clearer the distinction between a review and a revision, and correct cross-references.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09051233000095"></a>Any changes to the guiding principles in the future would already require consultation, as we set out in the Bill from the start. However, I have listened to the concerns of the House about the role of Parliament in determining the guiding principles, and the amendments address those concerns. I hope that noble Lords are content with these amendments and I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09051233000102"></a>The amendment will allow our regulations to be broad enough to allow innovation to flourish, while ensuring that people are well supported. It will also allow patients to buy support services using their direct payments. Some people have suggested that PCTs should commission and pay for support services centrally. Others have proposed including an element within the personal health budget to allow patients to choose the support that is right for them. It is likely that different approaches will work in different circumstances, and this amendment gives us the flexibility to test both.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09051233000103"></a>Amendment 12 clarifies how we intend to evaluate direct payments. The first part highlights our objective to commission and publish an independent evaluation. Noble Lords may know that the department recently published a detailed invitation to tender for the evaluation of the personal health budgets pilot programme. We hope to have a team of independent researchers in place by the summer.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09051233000104"></a>I emphasise that every pilot site will be involved in the evaluation. In practice, it is likely that a representative subset of the pilots, chosen by the evaluation team, will be examined in great detail, while the other sites contribute information. This will give both breadth and depth to the analysis.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09051233000105"></a>The evaluation will, of course, specifically consider the effect of direct payments as a mechanism for delivering personal health budgets. The findings of the evaluation will be published. Moreover, before the Government can extend direct payments more widely, each House of Parliament must give its express approval, through the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09051233000106"></a>The second proposed new subsection in the amendment allows the Government to specify in regulations some of the issues the review should address. These include reviewing the administration of the schemes, the effect of direct payments on the cost or quality of care, and the impact on the behaviour of patients, carers and providers.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09051233000107"></a>I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, is particularly concerned about the potential effect of personal budgets on other services, particularly the effect on smaller specialised service providers. The amendment is deliberately worded in a general way to emphasise that we intend to examine the effect of direct payments both on the people who receive them and on those who do not. Our invitation to tender makes that clear.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09051233000108"></a>Amendment 13 is a technical amendment, reflecting the addition of these paragraphs in new Section 12C. We have listened to the points raised in the debate and I believe that these government amendments respond to them. They provide explicit reassurance that we intend there to be a proper support in place for people receiving direct payments, and that the evaluation should be rigorous and independent. I commend these amendments to the House. I beg to move.</p>

They are the product of intense discussions between the department and myself. I am most grateful that we have achieved a resolution of matters which although technical and boring are of great importance to the working of this policy. I am delighted to be able to do so in the presence of the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, because those who sat through our discussions will see her hand in this amendment in the inclusion of the word &#147;support&#148;. She took me to task on my original proposals and she made them better. I am therefore pleased that this represents a victory for her, too.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09051233000110"></a>I do not want to restate the arguments we had during previous stages. I am pleased that the noble Lord has seen the importance of requiring primary care trusts to pay attention to the provision of these services, not least because in the department&#146;s own advice and guidance to commissioners, it talks about reliance on existing services such as the CAB. When these pilots take place, those services will be going through a great deal of upheaval and may not be readily accessible to people.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09051233000111"></a>As regards the review, I thank the Minister for his explanation and for sharing with me the detailed spec for the review process. However, I seek clarification from him on one point. He talked about the wording of the amendment, enabling the research to focus not only on those patients who receive direct payments, but also on those who do not. I would welcome his confirmation that the wording of the amendment is such that it would not be a matter of looking only at those patients who do or do not receive direct payments for the same service, but looking at the impact of a service which is funded by direct payment on other parts of the health service. That is the point that I have been trying to make for the past week.</p>

<a name="90512-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09051233000112"></a>I am under no illusion that it will be an extremely complex piece of research. The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, talked about the need to research the cost of direct payments, but to research the cost-effectiveness of direct payments will require a level of monitoring and accountancy, and sophistication in those, which is as yet unseen. We need properly to be able to answer the question, &#147;Does the move towards direct payments and individual budgets not only benefit patients in terms of the outcomes of those services, but decrease reliance on other services in the NHS?&#148;. That is a critical part of the issue. From what the Minister has said, I believe that he will be able to give me a satisfactory answer. With that in mind, I thank him very much for the work that he has done to get us to this point.</p>

To clarify the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, the tender for the evaluation is based on five broad areas: the effects on individual outcomes, including carers and informal carers; the behavioural change on both individuals and NHS staff; finances and cost-effectiveness; system effects, including impact on staff and other existing services, and how personal budgets have been implemented. It covers a wide range of services, so I very much hope to have reassured the noble Baroness.</p>

It has always been our intention that prizes would include research; innovation is a broad concept, of which research is a vital part. The purpose of the innovation challenge prizes is to recognise and promote excellence in innovation, including research. I am grateful to the noble Lords for our useful discussions on the matter and hope that this amendment puts that important point beyond doubt. I beg to move.</p>

However, after our discussions I am sufficiently reassured that any revision of the NHS Constitution and other issues would take full account of the needs and concerns of those involved in such education and training. In the light of those assurances, then, the amendment that we had considered tabling for Third Reading has proved unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09051233000117"></a>At the same time, I expressed the concern that had been conveyed to me&#151;not least, by the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust and the Association of Medical Research Charities&#151;that the word &#147;research&#148; did not formally appear in the Bill. All innovation is, in many respects, dependent on research. Whether the innovation is physical, social, behavioural, scientific, or whatever its nature, achieving it depends on a background of inquiry and research. For that reason, I believe that the amendment meets our concerns precisely, and I am delighted to see it now come into the Bill.</p>

For the record, I also thank him for his recognition that research might originate outside England&#151;for example, in Wales&#151;but result in excellent innovation in England, and that Welsh researchers would not be denied credit simply because their research was done on the other side of Offa&#146;s Dyke.</p>

Although not directly relevant to the amendment, the guidance on the preferential donation principle, which I introduced earlier, is now being taken forward. I have had the privilege of being able to comment on the confidential draft guidance and it looks satisfactory. When linked to the training of transplant co-ordinators, I think it will greatly improve donation rates.

I must declare an interest as the chair of a mental health foundation trust in east London and I make it clear that my own trust will not plan any changes in its own practice whether or not this amendment becomes law.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09051233000121"></a>The new clause leaves the private patient cap in place, although I believe that as soon as possible it needs to be replaced by a new framework. As we debated in Committee and on Report, the cap varies from one trust to another. I shall not repeat our earlier debates; suffice it to say that the cap is well recognised to be illogical and unhelpful. By providing for exceptions, the amendment opens up an opportunity for rational decision-making as long as the interests of the NHS are served. Introducing that one principle into the Bill is something to which all sides of the House would subscribe.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09051233000122"></a>I hope that proposed new subsection (4B) in the amendment will enable Ministers to introduce regulations which will extend important principles to all private patient service developments, and not only to services developed over and above the level allowed by the cap. Examples would include the principle that private patient services will not be subsidised by the NHS and the principle that those services will not dilute or adversely affect the core values of the NHS. In my view, both are crucial principles but they are absent from the 2006 Act.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09051233000123"></a>A further powerful argument in favour of the amendment is that it will enable the NHS to benefit from the considerable export opportunities provided by our highly respected NHS clinicians.

The virtue of this amendment, as drafted, is that it would allow the Government to make changes to the rules governing the private patient income cap at a time entirely of their choosing. It would not tie the Government down and it would allow Ministers to reformulate these rules in whatever way they decide, as long as any changes conform to the key principle spelt out in the amendment.

I declare two interests. I was the Minister who moved the offending clause in the 2003 Act in this House. As I said on Report, I repent my sins. I do so again. I will explain why I differ from my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. First, I must declare an interest as an adviser to the General Healthcare Group, which is a private hospital. It is in no way asking me to support this amendment; I have had no conversations with the General Healthcare Group about it. I am doing this because I think that the legislation, as framed, is wrong and detrimental to the NHS.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09051233000127"></a>Why do I think that? First, the world has moved on since we passed the legislation in 2003. There was a different set of circumstances then. We now know that foundation trusts are an important part of the NHS landscape. They have proved very successful. If you look at the Healthcare Commission&#146;s ratings, foundation trusts are in many ways extremely successful because of the excellence of their services and their management of financial resources. There were, if we are honest, doubts about foundation trusts at the time that this legislation was passed. Some of those doubts were expressed in the issue of a private patient cap. That is no longer the context in which we are dealing with this.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09051233000128"></a>The cap itself has been arbitrary. It chooses a base year when people were in different positions in terms of their private incomes. The consequence of that definition has been that whether particular trusts are caught by the cap is almost random. I do not make a major claim about this, but it has in a few cases prevented an NHS trust getting foundation trust status because its business case depended&#151;partly because of its international reputation&#151;on growing private practice, usually from overseas earnings that would benefit the NHS. Legislation that is supposed to protect the NHS is, in my view, damaging it. We are moving into a financial climate where the NHS&#151;if I may put it as gently as this&#151;will need every penny that it can get to meet public expectations, which always continue to rise in our modern world, and some of the demographic challenges that it will face. It seems a bit of an own goal to restrict the ability of NHS trusts to marshal their activities, without detriment to NHS patients, so that they can generate some income from this.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09051233000129"></a>My noble friends have said that the case is now under judicial review at the High Court, so it is difficult to deal with this; we should wait for the judgments and then move the legislation that may need to be put in place. I have always found that the courts welcome clarity from the Executive about what their policy intents are. This is not to prejudge the case that is before the High Court, and which was, as I recall, taken apart by UNISON. However, it would be helpful for the Government to be absolutely clear about where they stand on this issue. The issue seems to be one of making it very clear that there is a public acceptance

I would like much more clarity on this issue because the worst of all worlds would be a judicial judgment which is more restrictive than what we have at the moment, and that cannot be beyond peradventure. We need to be clear about the Government&#146;s position so that we do not end up with an even more restrictive cap and no legislative opportunity to change things back, even to where we thought they were in 2003.</p>

<a name="09051233000131"></a><b><a name="90512-0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09051233000790"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> My Lords, during our earlier deliberations I had a great deal of sympathy with the position put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. My name is on the amendment and the reason for that is very simple. We could debate how foundation trusts operate in great detail and at considerable length&#151;as we did during the passage of the legislation to which the noble Lord, Lord Warner, has just referred&#151;but, ultimately, proposed new subsection (4A) contains the key point, that any private-patient work must be in the interests of the NHS. However long we continue to debate this issue in great detail, I am persuaded that that is the critical point, and the fact that we have agreement across the House on it is important. Another important point is the arbitrary nature of the way in which the cap is working and the problems that it creates for mental health trusts in particular. Those two factors alone were sufficient to convince me that this is a move forward in the right direction.</p>

This is a Trojan horse that could be used by a future Government to completely undermine whole areas of the National Health Service. I am astonished to find her name on this amendment.</p>

<a name="09051233000133"></a><b><a name="90512-0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09051233000792"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> My Lords, I support the amendment because, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said, we are in a very changing world. I shall refer only to the area of cross-border healthcare. The present amendments are opening up our thinking to the changes happening in health services. At the moment we have a minimal cross-border healthcare system but the European Union and the Commission are looking at developing it and that will be an added complication. Anything that frees up health trusts&#146; ability to think through the provision of alternative ways of developing their services would be helpful. I therefore support the amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_938"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 938</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when Mrs Castle, later Baroness Castle, attempted to remove all private beds from all National Health Service hospitals. I was a whole-time NHS consultant with a personal chair and I had a major research unit studying neuromuscular diseases in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In that city there were three major hospitals, each of which had one private bed. The result, to my great regret, was that I could not admit to hospital patients who were referred to me from other countries&#151;patients from Australia, and even two from the United States&#151;to take advantage of my unit&#146;s facilities for research and investigation. There were no private beds to which I could admit them and no private hospital in that city had anything like the facilities necessary for that particular purpose.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09051233000135"></a>This cap was based on private income in hospitals in 2003, but the world has moved on since then. Particularly within our foundation hospitals, but also within our university departments, there are professorial units with innovative procedures and treatments that are being rapidly developed and could prove to be not only extremely important for patients&#151;after all, let us not forget the large number of patients in the UK who are insured for private medical care&#151;but also a very attractive possibility for patients coming to this country from overseas who must by law be private patients if they are admitted to hospitals in the National Health Service.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09051233000136"></a>The present cap is proving to be outdated, illogical and detrimental to processes which could benefit the NHS by bringing in substantial additional finance to support its work. The amendment is cleverly phrased to indicate that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="09051233000299"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for exceptions&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051233000256"></a>It rests with the Secretary of State,</p>
<ul><a name="09051233000324"></a>&#147;subject to the principle that any such exception must in all the circumstances be in the interests of the National Health Service&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051233000257"></a>That is a very satisfactory way to frame the amendment and I support it strongly.</p>

<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="09051233000137"></a><b><a name="90512-0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09051233000794"></a>Baroness Masham of Ilton:</b> My Lords, I would like to ask a question because of what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said. Are there not very strong safeguards in this amendment to protect the National Health Service? I travelled back from Mauritius once with a young child whose face was covered with a terrible cancer. Would it not benefit that sort of patient to be given treatment in our hospitals, because their countries do not have the facilities? We must be a humane country.</p>

The amendment would allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to permit exceptions to the general rule. An exception could be permitted only if it was in the interests of the NHS to do so. The regulations can specify other conditions and principles on which such exemptions may be permitted.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_939"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 939</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90512-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09051233000139"></a>The Government recognise the concerns which have been presented to us. We have also listened carefully to the views expressed in debate, not least that caps set by reference to historical income levels appear increasingly arbitrary. The Government sympathise with and understand the intention and spirit behind today&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09051233000140"></a>In our previous debates on this issue I made clear the Government&#146;s desire for a wider debate on the cap. Following the outcome of the judicial review on the current legislation, it is our intention to begin a review to address precisely how to strike the right balance between protecting NHS services for NHS patients and allowing NHS foundation trusts the flexibility they need to operate effectively in the best interests of patients. This would mean a review of the cap and appropriate action to follow.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09051233000141"></a>I turn to the specifics of the amendment. It is quite right that to change the cap would require primary legislation. However, I have genuine concerns about the approach that the amendment takes and about rushing into any quick legislative fix. I would like to take a few moments to set out some of the issues raised by the amendment and explain why a broader review following a clear process would be a better and more practical route to take and be in the best interests of the NHS.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09051233000142"></a>As your Lordships know, this is a complex policy area. The fact that we have already discussed it twice, in Grand Committee and on Report, highlights both the range of views that need to be taken into account and the difficulty of crafting legislation.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09051233000143"></a>The amendment would enable the Secretary of State to make exceptions to the current cap. However, it would not remove the cap&#146;s underlying principle that the private income of a foundation trust should be restricted according to levels set in 2002-03. The Secretary of State would be able to use regulations under the amendment to create exemptions to the cap; for example, to allow mental health foundation trusts to carry out private patient work. However, legal advice is that those regulations could not be used to such an extent that the effect of the underpinning primary legislation was nullified. In short, we could not use exemptions to get rid of the underlying rule. The level playing field which was described in Committee by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, with a new system having an equal impact on both NHS and foundation trusts, would not be achieved.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09051233000144"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, a judicial review is currently considering what income counts towards the cap. The Government are an interested party in the legal proceedings, so I will not comment on the interpretation of the current provisions. However, noble Lords will wish to be made aware that, even if this amendment were accepted, there would still be the issue of what income counts towards the cap. The court will give a judgment on that issue.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09051233000145"></a>We might best describe this as a quick-fix solution, and I understand why people would be tempted by it, but it would not address the issues and underlying problems with the cap that we have discussed. We need a wholesale review of the underlying rule. The Government believe that the best way to reform the cap would be to  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_940"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 940</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>create a new test or set of principles that would apply equally to all foundation trusts, reforming the rules so that they are clear, logical and work well. We are keen not to replicate the current situation with the cap from the 2003 Act by bringing in new primary legislation without first discussing and testing it thoroughly with the NHS&#151;the people who will put the new arrangements into practice.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09051233000146"></a>We have heard in our discussions the wide range of views on the issue. Key stakeholder organisations inside and outside the NHS should be given the opportunity to contribute to a debate on the design of the new framework which should begin as soon as the judicial review is complete. We should not try to reach a consensus quickly on what the future framework should look like without consulting foundation trusts from the outset. The reform of rules that impact directly on them, in the context of an evolving health policy framework, needs to be considered in the round.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09051233000147"></a>We agree that private patient activity should not lead to a poorer service for NHS patients and that private income should subsidise NHS care and, therefore, be used to improve and widen NHS services. We also agree that NHS foundation trusts must above all preserve and promote the values of the NHS. We therefore need to go through a clear, fair, practical process to develop fully the best policy solution before we legislate&#151;which we will of course do at the first opportunity once the approach has been agreed.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09051233000148"></a>I repeat our commitment to take forward a review following the outcome of the current judicial review. This is the most sensible way of making sure that any new approach reflects the views of those affected and enables us to test those practical solutions. With this assurance in mind, and with thanks to noble Lords for the valuable contributions they have made to the discussion, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="09051233000149"></a><b><a name="90512-0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09051233000796"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for her comments. I recognise that the amendment does not answer all the problems that the cap poses for the NHS&#151;that is inevitable. However, the amendment does enable&#151;quickly&#151;some opportunities for rational decision-making that are not there at the moment.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09051233000150"></a>The amendment clearly places in the Bill a principle that has the support of all sides of the House. I have been given assurances that there are people in the Government who do not have a problem with it, because it is going in the direction that the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, indicated the Government want to go in. We are saying, &#147;Let us take a step forward in the direction that the Government want to go&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09051233000151"></a>When the Government are able to institute a review, we would all hope to be involved in it, contribute to it and support it. Then, if possible, a consensus can be found through a good consultation process in which all the issues can be resolved, and a set of principles wider than we are able to deal with today can be put into a future Bill. However, that is all for the future. There is no upcoming health Bill, and the issues are too important to leave for an unspecified opportunity in the future. NHS foundation trusts up and down the country are struggling with this. In my view, having

We have boards of governors and members councils out there that will be watching this and will know that the principle is in the Bill&#151;if we can get it in the Bill. Personally, as somebody who passionately believes in the NHS and NHS patients, I want&#151;and we want&#151;that principle in the Bill. Therefore, I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

The amendments appear complex, but I reassure this House that nothing in them changes whether a function is devolved, or on whom it is conferred. The only effect is to classify functions as either &#147;retained&#148; or &#147;devolved&#148; for the purposes of this part of the Bill and, in particular, for deciding when the marine policy statement should influence public authority decision-making.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_944"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 944</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90512-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09051233000153"></a>Since additional procedural requirements will apply to any devolved marine plan which is intended to affect &#147;retained&#148;&#151;in other words, &#147;non-devolved&#148; functions&#151;it is therefore important that we get the definitions right, and that they are capable of adjusting to the nuances of the different devolution settlements. Otherwise the risk is that we may find that plans could be prepared which affect UK functions without having gone through the correct procedure, or, alternatively, that we are inappropriately constraining the exercise of functions which have been devolved.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09051233000154"></a>The policy which lies behind the amendments is straightforward and is unchanged from the Bill as published in draft and as introduced. If the marine policy statement has been adopted by the policy authority for a marine planning region, then it will be a &#147;relevant marine policy document&#148; for all decisions made by any public authority in relation to that region. Similarly, if a marine plan has been adopted for an area and the plan meets the conditions set out in Clause 57(4), then that plan will also be a &#147;relevant marine plan document&#148; for all decisions in relation to that area. However, the devolution settlements are different for each devolved Administration and use different terminology, which must be properly used to ensure that this Bill has the right effect in practice.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09051233000155"></a>Clause 57(5) presently sets out the effect of the marine policy statement on different decisions. Amendments 91A to 91F amend the present Clause 57(5) to clarify it and insert the new terminology of "secondary" devolved functions and so on, which are used in the new clause inserted by Amendment 91N.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09051233000156"></a>At the same time, Amendment 91G removes the present definition of &#147;retained functions&#148; in Clause 57(7) and (8). Amendment 91N inserts a new clause which defines &#147;retained functions&#148; by providing that all functions are &#147;retained&#148; unless they fall within the classes listed in subsection (1). The subsequent subsections in the new clause provide further detail as to the scope of each of the classes listed in subsection (1). In particular, neither &#147;secondary devolved functions&#148; nor &#147;relevant ancillary functions&#148; can be considered &#147;devolved&#148; if the UK Government still have substantive functions in relation to them.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09051233000157"></a>Finally, Amendments 91H to 91M and 126B update or insert a number of definitions as a result of the changes to Clause 57 and the insertion of the new clause, while Amendments 75A, 77A and 99A update the cross-references to &#147;retained functions&#148; throughout the Bill to refer to the new clause.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09051233000158"></a>I am confident that this drafting delivers the right result and properly respects both UK &#147;retained&#148; functions and the competence of the devolved Administrations. I beg to move.</p>

The amendments are complex and appear to be complicated, but I have read them thoroughly and, speaking specifically about Wales, I am satisfied that he has covered what I regard as the important points.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09051233000160"></a>Amendments 75A and 77A are welcome, in that they spell out clearly the meaning of &#147;retained functions&#148; in relation to devolved authorities and legislatures.  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_945"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 945</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Amendment 91A would define what happens if a devolved policy authority adopts an MPS. There then follows a series of consequential amendments, Amendment 91B to 91G. Amendment 91H rightly describes the Counsel General to the Welsh Assembly Government, as he or she is the most senior legal officer in the Assembly and Government of Wales.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09051233000161"></a>Amendment 91K defines the description of the First Minister in the Government of Wales Act 2006. Prior to that, between 1999 and 2006, the title of First Minister was not entirely secure in legislative terms. It also separates out a non-departmental government authority from Welsh Ministers and the legal officer.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09051233000162"></a>The group follows on in Amendment 91M to define exactly what a primary devolved authority is in relation to a devolved policy authority. This gives clarity to the legislation as far as Wales is concerned. Amendment 91N is helpful in defining the retained functions for Wales. It spells out where the Welsh ministerial functions lie, and also in relation to joint functions, an interesting aspect of the Minister&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09051233000163"></a>Given that the Marine and Coastal Access Bill includes matters that directly impact upon Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government and the National Assembly of Wales, Amendment 91 is particularly helpful in defining the parameters which I am sure that the devolved bodies in Wales will absorb. Amendments 99A and 126B give further clarification, Amendment 126B on town and country planning legislation. On the whole, having looked at the detail of Minister&#146;s amendments, I think that I can make sense of them.</p>

<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="09051233000164"></a><b><a name="90512-0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051233000800"></a>Baroness Carnegy of Lour:</b> My Lords, I remember, during the passage of the Scotland Act through this House, the late Lord Mackay, who was on the Front Bench for us, saying that the lopsided type of devolution that we were adopting would lead to great complexity in legislation. He said that we might well end up with a federal system simply to get the simplicity. That is probably not what we want.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09051233000165"></a>This is a perfect example of what lopsided and uneven devolution brings about in legislation. The Bill is getting fatter and fatter. Quite honestly, it is becoming pretty confused as we go along. I am sure that these amendments are necessary but, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, I cannot comment on them in detail; I dare say that my noble friend on the Front Bench may do so. However, one day, we will have to simplify all this. Quite honestly, one definition leads to the need for another. It is pretty confusing.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09051233000166"></a>I trust that the Government have got it right and that, if somebody spots further faults here, they will be put right in the other place. In the mean time, however, I support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="09051233000167"></a><b><a name="90512-0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051233000801"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for the extremely helpful letter that was sent to Peers showing, in language that was not that much easier but in more narrative form, the effect of these amendments. I congratulate him on the final paragraph in the annexe dealing with this suite of amendments. He repeated the first sentence of it about his confidence that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051233000325"></a>&#147;this drafting delivers the right result&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_946"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 946</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09051233000258"></a>Yet I cannot resist sharing with the House the second sentence, which reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="09051233000301"></a>&#147;Whilst it will never be possible to draft for every eventuality, it must be remembered that the duty to act in accordance with the MPS and plans permits public authorities to take other &#145;relevant considerations&#146; into account, which enables flexibility in the future to adapt to unforeseen circumstances&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051233000259"></a>I thought that was masterly.</p>

<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="09051233000168"></a><b><a name="90512-0005.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09051233000802"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> My Lords, I also wish to thank the Minister for explaining his amendments in such a succinct fashion, especially on the back of the very comprehensive briefing that he gave us, which I picked up in my post yesterday afternoon. I am also grateful to him for admitting that it is a complex group, but I am glad to respond because it touches on an area that has exercised my mind since we first began considering the Bill. How far are we aware of what powers are devolved to which Administration, and will all the authorities find clear definition of where they are allowed to exercise authority in the future? Certainly, this group of amendments is a good attempt to address that.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09051233000169"></a>Amendment 75A, which is put in more or less as a consequential amendment, is pretty far-reaching. Every marine authority drawing up its plan will have to state where it sees retained functions being involved. Will that be subject to review by the Secretary of State as part of the approval process? Will the list be confined to retained functions within marine legislation, FEPA legislation and renewable energy legislation or will it have to take in the overarching areas of retained functions such as defence, marine shipping and minerals?</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09051233000170"></a>It is very appropriate that this area should be subject to fairly detailed clarification in the Bill, as most of those who have spoken have mentioned. I am glad that it has been in the hands of proper parliamentary draftsmen, as I am not sure anyone else could have battled their way through all the different bits of devolved legislation that are necessarily hard for us to follow. Perhaps once these provisions are in the Bill, those with a sharper brain than mine will see whether there are areas that need tidying up.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09051233000171"></a>I am glad that the Government have addressed the question of where the powers lie for any authority that withdraws from a marine policy statement. I think the Minister is aware of my misgivings about the possibility that an authority might not bother to withdraw but simply ignores the directions that are contained within the relevant marine plan. He tried to reassure me about that in Committee. Otherwise, I am much encouraged by the group of amendments.</p>

Let me reiterate that it is extremely complex and I am very grateful for the tolerance shown by noble Lords in this debate.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09051233000173"></a>I welcome the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, about clarity. I thought that his analysis from a Welsh point of view was impeccable. The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, reminded us of the riveting debates on the Scottish Bill as it went through your Lordships&#146;  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_947"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 947</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>House. We all of course recall Lord Mackay and the contribution he made to those debates and that legislation. He is still very much missed in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09051233000174"></a>I do not quite agree that we have lopsided legislation&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_125"></a>

Legislation is not even between different parts of the country. We have legislated differently for different areas. That is why we referred to it at that time as lopsided devolution.</p>

<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="09051233000176"></a><b><a name="90512-0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09051233000805"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, I am grateful, but one person&#146;s lopsidedness is another person&#146;s flexibility in meeting the circumstances of each devolved Administration.</p>

The situation in Wales is not satisfactory. We should much prefer to have the kind of settlement that Scotland has had; if we did, we would not have such complex legislation in front of us today.</p>

<a name="09051233000178"></a><b><a name="90512-0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09051233000807"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, although it is very tempting to debate particular aspects of devolution in relation to Scotland and Wales, I had better desist from doing so. However, I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, that I very much hope that the end result is not a federal system of government. On the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, the polling showed up some very interesting results, which were encouraging for those of us who believe that the Union has much for which to commend itself. However, I realise that the more I speak, the more I tempt noble Lords to debate devolution in general.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09051233000179"></a>Regarding the specifics of my amendments, noble Lords may ask why it has taken until now for the Government to provide the clarity required. The short answer is that the final discussions between the devolved Administrations and the UK Government that took place in the autumn&#151;which led to the confidence that I have stated in this House before that we can make this work from the UK&#146;s point of view&#151;meant that a lot of work then had to be done to ensure that the Bill was up to scratch in relation to the devolution settlement. We have been working very closely with counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and with parliamentary counsel in going through the detail of this revised clause. Of course, the framework of responsibilities within the devolution settlement is extremely complex, but I am confident that we now have it as right as it can be. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, that if we spot further changes that need to be made, there will be another opportunity to do so. I hope that that will not be necessary but, as a result of these amendments, we now have the support of all the devolved Administrations regarding the definitions that we are proposing.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09051233000180"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for her comments on my extremely lengthy letter. She is right to say that I left a caveat in the penultimate sentence, but that is just a sensible precaution and I do not think that anything more should be read into it.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_948"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 948</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09051233000181"></a>In Committee, the noble Duke raised his concern that this is a very complex area. Although we are confident that we have it right, and the UK Government and devolved Administrations understand their respective responsibilities, ensuring that that is communicated to all the people who will be affected by this legislation in the future is a considerable challenge. He is right about that, and we will have to think very carefully, as will the other Administrations, about how that is to be done.</p>

<a name="90512-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09051233000182"></a>Regarding the noble Duke&#146;s specific question, my understanding is that the public authorities already know which functions are devolved and which are retained, so we do not think that that is particularly an issue. I reiterate, as I have done on many occasions, that Part 3 does not affect the devolution settlement, however much the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, wishes that it does.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90512-0006.htm"/>


<a name="90512-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09051233000184"></a>The first of my amendments is to paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 6, where we are told that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="09051233000304"></a>&#147;The marine plan authority for &#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="09051233000305"></a>(a) the English inshore region, or</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="09051233000306"></a>(b) the Welsh inshore region,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="09051233000307"></a>must also take all reasonable steps to secure that any marine plan for a marine plan area ... is compatible with the relevant Planning Act plan for any area in England, Wales or Scotland&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051233000260"></a>My amendment would add a further reference to Scotland, because I seek to understand how this paragraph works. I am certainly not trying to interfere with the devolution settlement. I wrote down a number of possibilities as to what it might mean, and I have crossed out most of them in my notes; I do not want to demonstrate my ignorance absolutely and totally. I wondered whether it was because of the reference to adjoining and adjacent areas in the next sub-paragraph, but I would be grateful if the Minister explains how paragraph 3(2) operates as regards Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09051233000185"></a>Amendment 79 would take out the words &#147;all reasonable steps&#148;. Taking all reasonable steps to ensure compatibility, by definition, raises the issue of conflict and begs the question: what if they are not compatible?</p>

Under Clause 48(1)(a), the Scottish inshore region is not applicable in the Bill. One cannot legislate for it in this Bill.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09051233000187"></a>The way the waters of Scotland are now dealt with in the Bill is somewhat confusing. I do not think there is any way round it and the Scottish Parliament is quite happy about this. The Scottish inshore waters are being legislated for in the Scots Parliament; it is busy getting on with that now. The offshore waters are the mixture of one parliament responsible for some things, and another for others. How the boats sailing between the two will cope remains to be seen, but this is the arrangement we have. I do not think I could support Amendment 78, because I do not think it is applicable.</p>

It raises and helps to focus on an issue which arises out of the boundary between the south-west of Scotland and the north-west of England in the Solway Firth. There were amendments in Committee which I and the Government brought forward to address this.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09051233000189"></a>Since then I have received representations from Mr Gordon Mann of the Solway Firth Partnership about concerns which the partnership has about the future of marine conservation in the Solway Firth. That partnership was established in the early 1990s in response to the growing issue of integrated coastal zone management. In the Solway Firth a particular need was identified to have well joined-up integrated coastal zone management, not least because of the national boundary that goes though it. That boundary inevitably increases the number of agencies involved, operating under different legal systems north and south of the border, and different cultures north and south of the border can lead to different management arrangements. Therefore, I understand that the partnership has been worth while in bringing people together from the Scottish and English sides of the Solway Firth to identify issues and actions that are necessary to secure an environmentally sustainable future of that sea.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09051233000190"></a>The concern now being expressed is that there is no likelihood of sufficient consistency and co-ordination between the MMO, which will be established under this legislation, and the work done by Marine Scotland, which has already been established as an executive agency of the Scottish Government and which will operate under the Marine (Scotland) Bill that is currently before the Scottish Parliament. Assurances have been given, but they have no statutory foundation. It is believed that here is a real need for joint planning. Having been born and brought up in Annan in Dumfriesshire on the Solway Firth, I know only too well that here we have an ecosystem that does not recognise a national boundary. Therefore, it is important that there is some kind of shared responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09051233000191"></a>I understand that under the Scottish Bill, Marine Scotland will have the power to delegate the preparation of a local plan. That power of delegation is not available to the MMO. Defra has responded to representations that there will be an obligation to consult, but that is not believed to be sufficient. The amendment raises the issue of whether there is an interaction between the responsibility of Scottish Ministers and the inshore plan which directly impinges on an English inshore plan. Perhaps the Minister will indicate a willingness to engage with those who have an interest in the ecosystem and the management of the Solway Firth, so that when the Bill arrives in another place further consideration will have been given to identify whether there are sufficient mechanisms in place to address important issues and underpin the work that has been done since the early 1990s in trying to get a co-ordinated approach to coastal management in the Solway Firth.</p>

But I am now faced with the situation in which the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, wants clarification; the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, thinks that the amendment has nothing to do with the Bill; and the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, is asking about the boundary of the Solway Firth. I am in deep waters here, my Lords&#151;I am not sure how deep the Solway Firth is, but I am going to struggle.</p>

Let me say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that I have little to add to what the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said. Clause 48 sets out the marine plan authorities, and it does not include a marine plan authority for the Scottish inshore region because the Marine (Scotland) Bill, now being considered by the Scottish Parliament, covers planning for the Scottish inshore region. As there is no marine plan authority under this Bill for the Scottish inshore region, we cannot place obligations on something that does not exist. The valid point made by noble Lords will need to be considered in the context of that Bill when the Scottish Parliament is considering it, and we will of course draw its attention to the issues raised today. But this is very much a matter for that Bill and its consideration, and without grievously affecting the devolution arrangements we could not in this Bill legislate in that context for Scotland. That is why we do not propose to do so, and therefore I hope that the noble Baroness will regard her Amendment 78 as a probing one and will feel that she has received a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09051233000196"></a>Amendment 79 is different. It would remove the wording relating to &#147;reasonable steps&#148;; in effect, that would make full compatibility mandatory and take  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_951"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 951</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>away any reference to what is reasonable in the circumstances. Let me begin by reiterating that compatibility between terrestrial plans is extremely important. We want to see a seamless, integrated approach at the coast&#151;not least on the Solway Firth, which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, identified. We included paragraph 3 in the Bill to acknowledge the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendation that we needed to make that very clear. Yet ensuring absolute compatibility&#151;rather than working towards as much compatibility as we can achieve&#151;is not something that we can guarantee without disproportionate cost.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09051233000197"></a>The resources required by a maritime plan authority under an absolute duty to ensure compatibility with any related terrestrial plans, not just those adjoining or adjacent to the marine plan area in question, would be absolutely enormous. Beyond doing everything reasonable to ensure that plans are compatible, it could require the marine planners to imagine and work through every possible combination of potential development, location and circumstances to identify any situation in which the two plans might conflict.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09051233000198"></a>In our earlier debates on the need for consistency between the marine policy statement and national policy statements, the noble Baroness herself acknowledged the near impossibility of eliminating all potential conflict, particularly between &#147;two sets of statements&#148; that may have,</p>
<ul><a name="09051233000326"></a>&#147;developed at different times, with slightly different considerations&#148;. &#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/5/09; col. 509.]</ul>
<p><a name="09051233000261"></a>That is how she expressed the problem. She also described the absence of any conflict as,</p>
<ul><a name="09051233000327"></a>&#147;the best of all worlds&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/1/09; col. 330.]</ul>
<p><a name="09051233000262"></a>That burden of ensuring total compatibility would not and could not fall only on the marine plan authority, which would necessarily need to work closely with the terrestrial plan authorities to ensure a shared understanding of how terrestrial planning policies were expected to be interpreted and how they would relate to marine policies.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09051233000199"></a>With no limit of what is reasonable, this process could go on indefinitely, delaying the implementation of any marine planning and increasing the cost of the exercise for both terrestrial and marine authorities. That would obviously make it difficult to achieve our goal of preparing effective and, as far as we can obtain them, compatible plans for the whole inshore region in reasonable time. For the reasons that I have identified, an absolute duty is, as I am sure that all those in the House would recognise, an obligation that we could not put into the Bill.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09051233000200"></a>We have drafted an equal arrangement, which we think will assist planning authorities both on land and at sea to reach meaningful agreement on how their plans should work together. We cannot ask the marine plan authorities to do more than is reasonable or to throw unlimited resources at what might be a well-nigh impossible goal of eliminating any potential for conflict. We will strive for full compatibility; that is the philosophy behind the Bill. Compatibility is in everyone&#146;s interests, but it has to be within the bounds of what is reasonable and practical, both in terms of resources and time.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09051233000201"></a>There are safeguards in place. Both the marine and terrestrial plans are subject to extensive public scrutiny, providing as many eyes and minds as possible to help  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_952"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 952</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>identify and eliminate any potential incompatibilities. This is not about picking and choosing whether to be compatible with terrestrial plans, but the duty is clear: to do everything reasonable to ensure that marine plans are compatible with them. If plans were incompatible without good reason they would, of course, be open to challenge.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09051233000202"></a>Every time marine or terrestrial plans are updated, each always having regard to the other, they will become more closely and effectively integrated. In reality, we think the potential for significant conflict is low, but to imagine that it could be taken out altogether is not sensible. As we said last week, planners are expert at integrating and reconciling government policies when making their decisions, and we should acknowledge that level of expertise.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09051233000203"></a>I am confident that the mechanism we have proposed, by which marine planning authorities must take all reasonable steps to ensure compatibility with terrestrial plans and, in return, terrestrial planning authorities will have regard to national policies, including the MPS and marine plans, is the right balance. It is not the function of this legislation to set an impossible task for the marine planning authorities, as I hope the noble Baroness will recognise. Decision-makers may always take into account other relevant matters, such as contradictory plans. Of course, it is a decision-maker&#146;s job to be good at resolving such situations. We should trust them to do so within the framework of the legislation which, clearly, indicates that compatibility should be striven for, but not to the point where it becomes an absolute goal which is unrealisable.</p>

<a name="90512-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09051233000204"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, that I struggled with the Solway Firth. He will have to give me a little more time to think about that issue. He will appreciate fully that we await the progress of the Scottish Bill for the arrangements which will be made for Scotland. I am all too well aware that in all legislation of this kind the issue with regard to a boundary is always of importance and the boundary which involves a fluctuating ecosystem is particularly difficult. I shall write to the noble Lord on that point as I do not have an answer with that level of detail. I hope that he will accept that the framework of the Bill, in the context of the areas that it covers as far as England and Wales are concerned, strives to assert that there will be the necessary reconciliation of interest. That will apply as much to England and Scotland as to other parts.</p>

It would give the Scottish Parliament a power&#151;if it wished to exercise it&#151;that would allow Ministers to incorporate a general duty of biodiversity on public bodies when bringing forward the marine plan for the Scottish offshore region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09051233000216"></a>It is recognised, too, by the Scottish Government that their competence is limited in this. The Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, Richard Lochhead, said as much to the Liberal Democrat spokesman on marine issues, Liam McArthur, when the matter of the legislative consent motion was before the relevant committee of the Scottish Parliament in January of this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09051233000217"></a>Marine Scotland is the executive arm of Scottish Ministers and has responsibility for marine science, planning, policy development and management. Amendment 84A would enable the United Kingdom Parliament to confer on public bodies a responsibility for biodiversity. Amendment 84B would enable Marine Scotland, in taking forward its responsibilities, to have that power if the Scottish Parliament so wished. The wording used is in the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004, which, as I have indicated, extends at the moment only up to the 12-mile limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09051233000218"></a>It is clear that executive devolution will not confer powers on Scottish Ministers, but imposing this duty on public bodies has certainly been supported in Scotland. Under the previous Administration in the Scottish Parliament, the Advisory Group on Marine and Coastal Strategy was set up to look at the whole issue of the marine environment and it published its report in March 2007. It had a number of working groups and work streams and, in its contribution to the report, the work stream relating to marine nature conservation said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="09051233000317"></a>&#147;From the marine nature conservation perspective, the main requirement is that measures relating to nature conservation can easily be integrated across administrative boundaries, including the boundary currently placed at 12 nautical miles ... and that these can be integrated into measures for the wider regional seas (however these are defined)&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051233000263"></a>It went on to recognise that because the devolution settlement is as it is, that would require Westminster legislation; that it was not at the hand of Scottish Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09051233000219"></a>In its concluding paragraph, the report of the work stream states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="09051233000318"></a>&#147;While it is not specifically a Scottish competence, and thus outwith the remit of AGMACS, we also support the proposal to extend species protection measures equivalent to those in the Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act 1981, as amended by the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004, into the zone from 12 to 200 nautical miles&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09051233000264"></a>I understand that that has been done under subsequent regulations&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09051233000328"></a>&#147;and to extend the &#145;biodiversity duty&#146; on all public bodies and office holders into this zone, and would commend the definition of that duty in the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051233000220"></a>So there has been a recommendation that the duty should be extended into the offshore.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09051233000221"></a>The Scottish Government, in their consultation White Paper, <I>Sustainable Seas for All</I>, indicated that they wished to see the biodiversity duty on all public bodies. The paper states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="09051233000319"></a>&#147;If Scottish Ministers achieve further devolution of nature conservation in the offshore beyond 12nm, the Scottish Ministers would propose extending the scope of the duty to apply to all public bodies exercising functions in the offshore area. If further devolution cannot be agreed we would discuss with the UK Government how best to take forward this proposal&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09051233000222"></a>It is clear that only a limited devolution has been agreed which does not allow Scottish Ministers to do this. The amendments offer the House a choice: we can either devolve that power to the Scottish Parliament or, because it is stated in the devolved settlement that this Parliament would take the lead in this area, we can, perfectly properly, legislate to impose that duty, which quite clearly enjoys support north of the border.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09051233000223"></a>When the matter was debated on 23 February, the Minister stated in his reply:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="09051233000320"></a>&#147;On biodiversity, the simple and straightforward answer is that, although we do not use the wording used by the noble Lord, we believe that we have covered the matter in the Bill. In Clause 121, there is a duty on public bodies, including those in the Scottish offshore area, to further the conservation objectives of designated sites. Moreover, public authorities must have regard to advice from the statutory conservation body, which, for the offshore region, is the Joint Nature Conservation Committee&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/2/09; cols. 15-16.]</p>

<p><a name="09051233000265"></a>The point is that the duty is not solely for designated sites; it is a general duty for public bodies when exercising functions in relation to the offshore area which is set out in more detail in the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act and incorporated by reference in the amendment. Scottish Environment LINK told me recently that it does not believe that the present legislation goes far enough, nor is it competent for the Scottish legislation to cover it. It is concerned that there is a gap in the arrangements which it is the purpose of this amendment to bridge.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09051233000224"></a>I hope that the amendment will commend itself to your Lordships&#146; House. Both Governments are keen to ensure a marine ecosystem where nature conservation is taken forward. A gap has been identified; I do not believe that this legislation addresses it; and the purpose of my amendment is to ensure that a proper biodiversity duty is put on public bodies so that the boundary line at 12 nautical miles becomes meaningless. It seems a nonsense that a duty exists up to a certain point but not at 12.5 miles from the coast. The amendment seeks consistency right up to the 200-mile limit. Therefore, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09051233000226"></a>I do not envy the Minister in responding to these concerns. Not only are devolution arrangements impossibly complicated but the system of agreement means that the effect of a change in one arm is not readily apparent in another.

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09051233000227"></a>The Bill mentions sustainable development as one of its aims. Including biodiversity places a constraint on that concept. The Government have provided a draft strategy for marine protected areas, which most noble Lords here today will probably have recently received. In it, the Government emphasise biodiversity for England and Wales, but I do not think that biodiversity is mentioned in the Bill. Too strict an interpretation of biodiversity could create a problem if some new species or organisms were introduced that were detrimental to other elements of current biodiversity. Introducing a species increases biodiversity, but there is a choice to be made as to whether it is beneficial.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09051233000228"></a>I have heard scientists explain recently that we may find as we progress into the future that ecosystem evaluations are of greater importance than biodiversity evaluations&#151;the Government talk in their draft strategy about ecosystem service provision. If powers are to be given to the Scottish Parliament, it may be highly restrictive if they are to be limited to biodiversity.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09051233000229"></a>Amendment 84B would place a duty on Scottish bodies that is not placed on others. I shall therefore listen to the Minister&#146;s response with much interest.</p>

This is one of the strangest parts of the Bill. Ministers in the Scots Parliament decide things and Westminster legislates, as I understand it&#151;that is the problem. One has to realise that, when you move out into offshore waters away from Scotland, you come to areas where energy comes into it&#151;where actual and potential oil fields exist. There could be a conflict of interest between, say, the excavation of a potential oil field and the need to protect natural diversity at sea. It is very important that the same legislature should be legislating for those two things. As it stands, it is the Westminster Parliament.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09051233000231"></a>We must be very careful about this. Already the Scots Parliament and Ministers are referring to offshore as well as inshore waters as &#147;Scottish waters&#148;&#151;they are blurring the distinction. If we blur it further, we may be in trouble. For the United Kingdom, oil is a very different matter from biodiversity in those parts of the sea. It is a very important issue that could affect devolution and whether Scotland one day might become independent. We have got to be very careful about this. I can understand that this may be a solution to the gap, but I am afraid that the gap must continue to exist, inelegant though it is in the context of arrangements in the Bill.</p>

I do not think that I would put it quite as highly as that. As far as executive devolution is concerned, outside this Bill the Government have agreed in principle to devolve to Scottish Ministers the executive functions in these regulations that relate to offshore waters adjacent to Scotland. Scottish Ministers will become responsible for enforcement of nature conservation under the Bill and the 2007 regulations. The intention is that enforcement officers will have seamless access to the full suite of enforcement powers that they need for enforcing all nature conservation regulations. We are currently in the process of agreeing with the Scottish Executive how the new arrangements will work to ensure continued efficient administration of reserved functions and the protection of UK national interests in these waters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09051233000238"></a>Before I come on to the issues raised under the noble Lord&#146;s very interesting amendments, I should say that we are looking with great interest at the progress of the Marine (Scotland) Bill. Of course, as the UK Bill continues to go through the UK Parliament, we shall work very hard to ensure compatibility across the two Bills. The noble Lord raised a point in that regard under the last group of amendments. It is entirely relevant to the general discussion that we are having about how we make the devolution settlement work in the marine area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09051233000239"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendments raise two fundamental issues. There is the question, first, of the Scottish Parliament&#146;s competence and, secondly, of whether it  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_959"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 959</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is desirable to create a new duty to further diversity in the offshore area. As I have said&#151;and as the noble Lord has said&#151;the Scottish Parliament does not have the competence to legislate on biodiversity in the offshore zone. That is why the noble Lord wants to move this amendment in this House. However, we consider that Scottish Ministers have the ability through the various powers that they have under the Bill to achieve the practical effect of the amendments that he is aiming at. He has already quoted what I was going to say; in Clause 121, there is a duty on public bodies, including those in the Scottish offshore area, to further the conservation objectives in marine conservation zones. Those objectives are aimed in part at furthering biodiversity. The noble Lord made a general point about how the objectives relate to only the designated zones, but it is those zones with which we are most particularly concerned.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09051233000240"></a>What is more, any public authority operating in the Scottish region will have to do so within the terms of the marine plans to be prepared by Scottish Ministers and the marine policy statement, since, under the Bill, we are devolving to Scottish Ministers the responsibility for nature conservation in the Scottish offshore region. They will be able to include in their plans provisions in relation to conservation or furthering biodiversity. In that sense, they will be accountable to the Scottish Parliament for their decisions, which is another point that the noble Lord has made in a number of our debates.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09051233000241"></a>Scottish marine plans for the offshore region will have to be agreed by the Secretary of State but, having given Scottish Ministers executive responsibility for designating marine conservation zones, we see no reason to object to a plan on the grounds that it contained a duty such as that set out in subsection (1) of Amendment 84B, provided that it was consistent with this Bill and the marine policy statement. I hope that the noble Lord finds that comforting. We believe that Scottish Ministers already have the power under this Bill to include a duty to further biodiversity in marine plans, if they see fit.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09051233000242"></a>Amendment 84A seeks to insert a duty to further the conservation of biodiversity within the offshore region adjacent to Scotland. The first question is whether that duty is necessary, and we are not convinced that it is. All UK Administrations have emphasised the importance of consistency across the UK, while respecting the rights of each legislature. We have no such separate, explicit duty to further biodiversity in other UK offshore areas and we do not think that it is necessary. We already have a number of provisions in this Bill and in wider European legislation that allow us to further biodiversity conservation in the offshore area. We, and the Scottish Executive, will be able to consider biodiversity out to 200 nautical miles where MCZs have been designated. Furthermore, the statutory nature conservation bodies will be able to give advice relating to biodiversity under the provision set out in Clause 123. Public authorities are required to have regard to such advice, ensuring that biodiversity is effectively considered. As I have suggested already, our marine planning system provides the opportunity to drive the way that decisions are made in the direction of further biodiversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09051233000246"></a>Some inspiration has reached me on the issue of coal, so I shall test the patience of the House, if I may. Noble Lords will probably know that the Coal Industry Act 1994 regulates coal mining throughout Great Britain. The exclusive right to authorise coal-mining operations, or operations carried out for the purpose of searching and boring for coal in the terrestrial sea and on the UK continental shelf, is vested in the Coal Authority under the Coal Industry Act. Therefore, any coal-mining operation in the UK&#151;except the Northern Ireland inshore region, which has its own legislation&#151;will need authorisation from the Coal Authority under the Coal Industry Act 1994. A marine licence is only needed for the removal of substances from the seabed, not under the seabed. Therefore, mining operations that extract coal using tunnels dug from the shore would not need a marine licence. The noble Duke has been asking for an explanation on this for some time and I hope that we have finally come up with something that is close to satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09051244000002"></a>Clause 53 provides for the delegation of functions relating to marine plans. A direction can be given to delegate the functions by a public body. My concern is that a public body as defined in the Bill includes statutory undertakers. Most statutory undertakers are not public: they are private, albeit subject to particular regulation. I query whether it is proper or appropriate to delegate marine plan functions&#151;preparing a plan, identifying the plan area and so forth&#151;to the private sector, even with the Secretary of State's long-stop powers. That is not to say that a marine plan authority should not be working with or consulting statutory undertakers along with other bodies that fall within the normal definition of a public body: of course they should work together. Statutory undertakers will have a role because they have knowledge and views, but to

Therefore, my amendment would exclude statutory undertakers from the definition of public bodies used in the clause. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09051244000003"></a><b><a name="90512-0007.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09051244000147"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness's amendment is entirely understandable. I hope to reassure her on this. I agree entirely with her that it is unlikely that it would be appropriate for these functions to be carried out by many statutory undertakers, particularly by the large number which are utility and transport providers. I want to put on record that we are not considering any delegation of marine planning functions to public bodies of that type. The issue that we have is that the definition of statutory undertaker in Clause 312, which points further to that definition given in the relevant terrestrial planning legislation&#151;which the noble Baroness will know better than I do&#151;is wider than simply the utility and transport companies. It includes,</p>
<ul><a name="09051244000137"></a>&#147;persons authorised by any enactment to carry on any ...water transport, canal, inland navigation, dock, harbour, pier or lighthouse undertaking, or any undertaking for the supply of, or hydraulic power&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90512-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09051244000004"></a>That rather wide definition could include a number of public bodies with functions relevant to marine planning, including the Environment Agency and some harbour authorities. While we are committed to delegating our marine planning functions in relation to the English inshore and offshore regions to the Marine Management Organisation, we should not restrict other plan authorities, whom we have considered in some detail in our earlier discussions, from delegating their marine planning functions to public bodies such as harbour authorities or the Environment Agency which happen to be statutory undertakers. I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness sufficiently on that.</p>

<a name="90512-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09051244000005"></a>I turn to my Amendment 86, which reorganises the drafting of subsections (6) and (7) of this clause. Subsection (6) lists those functions of marine plan authorities which are excepted from the list of delegable functions and so cannot be delegated under this clause. However, many of the functions presently listed in subsection (6) are not, in fact, functions of marine plan authorities, but of the Secretary of State in his own capacity. These functions would not, therefore, be delegable functions to begin with and are more properly listed in subsection (7), along with other non-delegable functions of the Secretary of State. My speaking note says that the amendment is minor and technical and does not affect the powers of marine plan authorities to delegate their planning functions.</p>

I am full of admiration for the people who must be reading this Bill over and over again looking for matters such as this, to ensure that they are correct. I am reassured as to the Government&#146;s intentions; I accept that they will not be the only player in this, by any means. I am reassured by what the Minister had to say on my amendment. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I wish to pursue again with the Minister a point which I raised in Committee which relates to the courts&#146; jurisdiction if a person should wish to challenge relevant documents in relation to the Scottish offshore region. As the Bill stands, it would be possible to raise an action in either the Court of Session or the High Court. I cannot understand, and I am not aware of a precedent, why a matter relating exclusively to Scottish waters&#151;almost certainly an action where the respondent would be Scottish Ministers&#151;would find its way to the High Court when the Court of Session is perfectly competent, both legally and actually, to deal with the matter.</p>

<a name="90512-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09051244000008"></a>I remember when this was dealt with before; the Minister seemed to indicate that it was part of the general overall agreement with Scottish Ministers as to how the Bill would proceed. It struck me as very interesting that Ministers from the Scottish National Party should concede the jurisdiction of the Court of Session to the High Court. We perhaps need a slightly more detailed explanation than that one, which stretches credibility. Nevertheless, stranger things have happened.</p>

<a name="90512-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09051244000009"></a>If a matter relates exclusively to the Scottish offshore region, where the respondents, almost inevitably, would be Scottish Ministers, I cannot see how the High Court could in any way be an appropriate court for that to be heard. By all means, if the matter relates to the English inshore or offshore region, the High Court seems the obvious place. Indeed, if I understand the Bill, such a matter could end up in the Court of Session, which seems to me to be as perverse in the opposite direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09051244000010"></a>It is quite a simple point, but an important one. Through 300 years since the Act of Union, we have jealously guarded our distinctive legal system and we do not, even by some means not intended for that purpose, want to see it eroded.

We are all anxious that the legislation should be proper for the devolved powers under the Bill and this reflects some of the worries of the Law Society of Scotland. I wonder again whether this part of the Bill applies to Scotland&#151;whether Scotland has to be included. It would appear that the Government&#146;s view has been that the phrase,</p>

I am ever-hopeful about our relations with the Scottish Parliament and Executive, but let me try again to respond to what is clearly a very interesting amendment. It looks reasonable, but I have taken further advice since Committee, and the amendment has serious implications that might set a legal precedent, which is enough to get my advisers worried. We are not aware of any precedent in post-devolution legislation which limits the possibility of raising an action against Scottish Ministers in the Court of Session. Even the Scotland Act and the Human Rights Act do not contain such a provision and leave the question open to the normal rules of jurisdiction. The noble Lord will understand that we do not want to take a different approach, in principle, in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09051244000013"></a>Clause 59(6)(a) relates only to the English inshore and the Welsh inshore region. There is a mirror provision in the Marine (Scotland) Bill for the Scottish inshore region. As regards Clause 59(6)(b), its sole purpose is to provide that challenges relating to decisions about the offshore regions are brought in superior courts. Which superior court it is brought in will be determined by the normal rules of jurisdiction. In other words, an applicant can go to any court that comes within the description of a superior court and the court itself can decide whether it has jurisdiction or not. The Bill does not require matters to be referred to the High Court; there is no preference for the English or Welsh system over the Scottish courts. In practice, most, if not all actions that may be raised against a marine plan or the amendment of a marine plan, for an area within the Scottish offshore region, will be heard in the Court of Session. However, UK businesses operating in UK waters offshore from Scotland should, we believe, have the right to bring a case in the High Court if they consider that to be the most appropriate court.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09051244000014"></a>As the clause is drafted, it is left to the courts to determine where it is most appropriate for an application to be heard. I understand that that follows the normal rules of jurisdiction. Our expectation is that cases related to plans in the Scottish offshore region will go to the Court of Session and it is most likely that the High Court would decline jurisdiction over purely Scottish cases. Cases involving both UK and Scottish Ministers may be more complicated, because they relate to the Secretary of State&#146;s actions in agreeing to the plan in the Scottish offshore region, but there is nothing in the Bill to prevent those cases being heard in the Court of Session and no court is set out as more important than another. The courts themselves will be able to decide each application on its merits and, of course, Ministers could apply to a court to decline jurisdiction if they considered the decision inappropriate. Put simply, it is better that cases are determined on a pragmatic case-by-case basis than by reference to rigid rules. However, our major concern is using this Bill to depart from current practice and precedent.</p>

I pay tribute and give my thanks to my noble friend Lady Hamwee for the tremendous work she did, with her great expertise in terrestrial planning, on the planning parts of the Bill. It has been a great help to me and to our party and I believe that it has helped the House. The Government&#146;s positive response on planning issues and some of the government amendments has also been very helpful indeed. I thank them for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09051244000018"></a>We move on to licensing. The purpose of this amendment is specifically to insert principal local authorities as consultees on marine licensing applications. In Committee I moved a rather complex amendment setting out what principal local authorities were and so on. We all know what they are; they are county councils, district and borough councils and unitary authorities. The Government said in Committee that they did not want lists to appear in this part of the Bill. I have specifically tabled this amendment so that it is not a list but a specific reference to local authorities. In a moment I shall explain why it should be in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09051244000019"></a>This amendment is not as wide as the amendments I moved in Committee, which concerned a general duty to consult local authorities about everything.

The amendment would apply to relevant applications in the area of a local authority or adjacent to it.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09051244000020"></a>We return to the relationship of the MMO and the new marine regulatory system with territorial decision-makers, with coastal communities&#151;which we discussed in some detail last time&#151;and, particularly, with local authorities. It has been said that we do not want to put any further administrative burdens on the MMO. I do not believe that we are doing that at all by putting local authorities on the face of the Bill if the Government are saying that the relevant authorities will get consulted in practice anyhow. I suspect that that is what the Minister is about to tell me. The marine licensing functions include planning functions and a range of other functions that could impact on what I would call local authority interests&#151;the decision-making processes of local authorities representing their local communities. </p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09051244000021"></a>I had another look at this interesting document called <I>A Strategy for Promoting an Integrated Approach to the Management of Coastal Areas in England</I>, which we received some time ago, just to see what the involvement of local authorities is within that strategy. I have to say that I was disappointed. Under &#147;Marine Licensing&#148; there is a little flow chart, a simple one that I can understand, with &#147;Licensing decisions&#148; in the middle. The feed-in to that is &#147;Marine Policy Statement&#148;, &#147;National Policy Statements&#148;&#151;which I find slightly interesting but will not pursue now&#151;&#147;Marine Plan&#148; and &#147;Stakeholders&#148;, which has now forced me to say that word. I assume that local authorities are simply included among the stakeholders. I think that that is very unsatisfactory. As for marine licensing, as far as I can see, there is no other specific reference in this document to &#147;local authorities&#148;, which seems to be a mistake.</p>

The word &#147;licensing&#148; does not appear here but the word &#147;planning&#148; appears several times. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_124"></a><a name="09051244000133"></a>&#147;A number of key messages emerged from both case studies&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09051244000060"></a>there was one in the Thames estuary and one in south-west England, or relating to those places&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09051244000139"></a>&#147;including stakeholder engagement across all levels from as early as possible was very important&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051244000061"></a>Fair enough. One assumes that local authorities might be included there. The third bullet point says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051244000140"></a>&#147;participants believed that marine planning would improve integration between decision-making bodies on land and at sea, and could provide coastal decision makers with the certainty they needed to make more informed decisions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051244000062"></a>In a further flow chart it defines local authorities as being decision-makers&#151;so there is something there. Then, it says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051244000141"></a>&#147;the planning process should be set out clearly, be transparent and democratically accountable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051244000063"></a>I am not quite sure what &#147;democratically accountable&#148; means for the marine environment and the issuing of marine licences, including those on planning matters, unless it includes the democratic representatives of the coastal areas; in other words, the principal local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09051244000023"></a>On page 26, we have an astonishingly complicated flow diagram which I have great difficulty understanding. I could not work out whether it reminded me of one of those integrated circuit boards that I never understood or whether it is a complicated version of the tube map. It has 23 different types of organisations, statements or whatever in it, with arrows going in all sorts of directions. It includes one blob labelled &#147;Local authority&#148;, with an asterisk on it saying that this &#147;indicates decision-making organisation&#148;. However, the local authority and the local strategic partnership and one or two things connected with it seem to be in a little whirlpool&#151;or perhaps it is an eddy&#151;at the bottom of the chart, and not really related to its main functions. &#147;Coastal stakeholders&#148; all appear completely isolated at the bottom and only relate to the marine policy statement and plan and national policy statements. I do not quite understand how that works.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09051244000024"></a>The impression I get from looking at that is that local authorities are not regarded as the very special and rather different bodies which I believe that they are. They are special and different for two reasons. First, they have a lot of statutory responsibilities which interact and overlap with those of the Marine Management Organisation. That is particularly the case in the inshore areas, especially along the foreshore and the coast itself. They include fairly obvious ones such as planning, plan-making, development control; economic development functions, which are ever more important among local authorities; highways and transport, tourism and recreation functions, which are crucial on the coast; and environmental responsibilities whether environmental health, food hygiene or litter, and other such amenity issues. There are other responsibilities which noble Lords will readily bring to mind. As they have these important statutory responsibilities which will be affected by the MMO&#146;s decisions, the Bill should state that local authorities are at the very least statutory consultees.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09051244000025"></a>The second reason why local authorities are different is that they are democratically elected bodies representing the people who live along the coast. For that reason alone they ought to be set aside as something different from all the other consultees. It seems fairly clear to me that acceptable wording could be arrived at to do what I am asking to do. I ask the Government, at this late stage of the Bill in this House, nevertheless to consider this again. I beg to move.</p>

It follows one moved in Committee by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. In a subsequent debate we probed the degree to which local authorities were to be consulted on licence applications, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has done so again today. Indeed, we believe that local authorities&#146; participation in decision-making is highly desirable. I recollect that I came away from the previous debate assured by the Minister that this would be part of the procedure. I hope he can give us that assurance today.</p>

Obviously I did not give him sufficient assurances then. As he has now been joined by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, I can feel the pressure of force majeure.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09051244000028"></a>Clause 65 places on the licensing authority an obligation to publish, or require the applicant to publish, an application for a marine licence in a manner that is,</p>
<ul><a name="09051244000142"></a>&#147;best calculated to bring the application to the attention of any persons likely to be interested in it&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051244000029"></a>It is the Government&#146;s view that that would in all circumstances encompass local authorities whose areas are likely to be affected by the application without a specific reference in the Bill to do so. Other legislation uses exactly that phrase without further qualifying it in the way that the amendment seeks to do.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09051244000030"></a>We think that that is the right approach and that is why we resisted the amendment in Committee. However, I have listened to the strength of feeling expressed by the two noble Lords who have spoken today and it is clear that the assurances we gave in Committee are not sufficient. Therefore, we will look further at this issue between now and Third Reading. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will think that he has pressed the Government far enough today.</p>

I congratulate him on that and thank him for it. If the Government were to look at terrestrial legislation they would see that under planning legislation it is very often written down that appropriate planning authorities, for example, need to be consulted on planning applications. Indeed, parish councils have a right to be consulted on such applications. In the whole of the plan-making process there is a complex system of formal consultation which is set out in the legislation. I accept that we are talking about licences, but I suspect that if we looked at licensing legislation as well we might find that the same things applied. I am not an expert on that, but certainly planning legislation on planning applications, for example, clearly sets out that local authorities are statutory consultees if they are not the authority to which the application has been made. However, I heard what the Minister said and I thank him for it. I hope he can find a way of putting it in the Bill at Third Reading. As I say, local authorities are different in kind from all the other authorities that exist, because they are the democratically elected representatives of the local people. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Indeed, one hopes it will meet with similar success. He gave the impression that the power to make an exemption under Clause 71 was subject to the criteria under Clause 66; the appropriate authority has to have regard to protecting the environment and so on.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09051244000033"></a>I would welcome a little more clarification on how that is to happen. The two chapters appear to have been drafted completely separately with no obvious crossover. Obviously, we would want to be certain that no exemptions are granted that would have a significant environmental impact. Clause 71 seems to give authorities the power to exempt a damaging activity on the quiet in the hope of avoiding having to register it and admit to the damage they had permitted.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09051244000034"></a>Amendments 101 and 107 relate to the noting of exempted licences on the register. I understand that the Government are consulting on the matter, and quite rightly. They are concerned that planning a burden of registering activities that are exempted precisely because they are harmless and very small scale could place a disproportionate burden on some very small businesses.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09051244000035"></a>While we would certainly not want to increase the regulatory burden and are very pleased at the harmonisation that is happening in the Bill, if exemptions are used irresponsibly by the appropriate authority, the register could end up with some very worrying holes.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09051244000036"></a>Will there be any sort of assessment by the authority as to whether it would be wise to include an exempted activity on the register? It is not just the possibility of exempting environmentally damaging activities, which I covered in talking to my first amendment, it is also the possibility of exempting activities which would have an impact on another activity where it would be wise to keep tabs on what is happening in the environment.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09051244000037"></a>I would welcome any reassurances the Minister can give us that exemptions will be used wisely and that there will be some check on their abuse. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09051244000039"></a>I think his amendments are too widely drawn in many ways. There are day-to-day activities that go on. For instance, Trinity House might need to lay buoys or ships might need to anchor and other things like that. They should not have to be put on to a register every time they happen.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09051244000041"></a>On Amendment 100, we certainly agree that it is important that in the use of the exemption-making power under Clause 71 the licensing authority must adhere to the requirements outlined in Clause 66. They are factors that should be taken into account when determining what activities are appropriate to  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_975"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 975</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provide an exemption for, and whether that exemption is a blanket exemption or is to be given conditionally. It is reasonable to expect the licensing authorities to use the same fundamental principles that will be used to determine the impact of individual licence applications when making decisions on what activities are appropriate to be carried out without the need for a licence. We do not believe that there is a problem in relation to the Bill, but I have listened to the noble Lord and am prepared to give this matter further consideration. If I believe that we need to make a change, I will bring back an amendment at Third Reading to deal with the issue that the noble Lord has raised.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09051244000042"></a>So far as concerns Amendments 101 and 107, I hope that I can give reassurance in the way that the noble Lord has suggested. Placing exempted activities on the licensing register where appropriate provides transparency for those operating in the marine environment and allows each licensing authority to take into account the potential cumulative effects of both exempt and licensed activities undertaken in its area. We would expect many exempted activities to be registered in this way, and we have provided a clear mechanism in the Bill for that to happen.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09051244000043"></a>As I said in Committee, our concern is that a blanket requirement in the Bill would mean that some extremely minor, low-risk activities which would be exempted by order and would have a negligible impact on the marine environment would have to be listed. Examples of the kinds of activities that might fall into this category are already listed in the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (FEPA) exemptions order and the Deposits in the Sea (Exemptions) Order 1985. I think that it is a question of proportionality. Would it be proportionate for those launching a vessel, dropping an anchor in port or, as the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, suggested, depositing a buoy around a hazard to be under a statutory duty to notify the licensing authority each time that they carried out such an activity? We would be concerned about significant and unnecessary additional burdens being placed on many industries, not least the fishing and shipping industries. Our approach to using the exemption orders will achieve the same aims that the amendments are striving for&#151;the ability to monitor cumulative impacts and ensure protection of the environment&#151;but without the unnecessary additional burdens on already challenged industries.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09051244000044"></a>The public consultation on the exemptions order that we are soon to launch will canvass public views on whether each activity that we propose to exempt should be required to be notified to the licensing authority and then be placed on the licensing register. We would prefer to leave some discretion until we have seen the outcome of that public consultation. However, I reassure the noble Lord that our clear intent is to ensure that we can monitor activities which may have a cumulative impact on the environment.</p>

<a name="90512-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09051244000045"></a>The noble Lord asked whether the exemptions would be used in an inappropriate way, but of course that is not our intention. I hope that I have been able to give him the reassurance that he requires.</p>

<p><a name="09051261000097"></a>once it comes inshore. What is the position currently if the Scottish Government exercise their power to place a wind farm or a wave generator in the offshore area and then want to lay a cable to the shore? Surely, at the moment, there are powers that allow that to happen.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09051261000002"></a>The Minister will be aware that power over interconnectors was devolved to Scotland a little while ago. Does the definition of an interconnector not extend to the Scottish offshore area? How will this measure interact with that provision? The current wording of subsection (2) states that the authority,</p>
<ul><a name="09051261000138"></a>&#147;must grant any application ... for the carrying on of a licensable marine activity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051261000098"></a>At this stage none of us can know what might be argued as falling within that description. The inshore area is likely to be an area with great sensitivity to disruption or degradation. Possible routes for the cable might be various within the area, or they might be better in a neighbouring area. So the phrase &#147;must grant&#148; is too rigid a power to place in the hands of what will really be the developer, let alone anyone else. I would be glad to hear the Minister defend this term.</p>

<a name="09051261000003"></a><b><a name="90512-0010.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051261000149"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, I hope I can reassure the noble Duke on this matter, although I readily agree with him that it is complex. It has to be read alongside the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which I think adds to the complexity of the general issue.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09051261000004"></a>A coastal state&#146;s ability to regulate submarine cables is tightly defined by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Articles 58, 77 and 79 of UNCLOS, as it is popularly known, do not permit a coastal state to delineate the route of cables or regulate operations associated with the freedom to lay or maintain cables, on the continental shelf or in an exclusive economic zone, that are not involved in the exploration or exploitation of natural resources, or connected to an artificial island, installation or other structure.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09051261000005"></a>This means that there are four scenarios for which we have to cater. First, the rights given to the laying and maintaining of submarine cables under UNCLOS do not extend, as I said, to those cables that are involved in the exploration or exploitation of natural resources, or those connected to an artificial island, installation or other structure. To answer the noble Duke&#146;s question, these cables&#151;such as those running to or from offshore wind farms&#151;will require a marine licence, just like any other marine licensable activity, from the appropriate licensing authority as defined in Clause 110. This is regardless of whether they are in the territorial sea or the continental shelf.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09051261000006"></a>The second scenario is that the rights given under UNCLOS do not extend to any cable that is entirely within the territorial sea. Again, these cables will require a marine licence from the appropriate authority as defined in Clause 110.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09051261000007"></a>The third is that activities relating to the laying and maintaining of cables that are not connected with the exploration or exploitation of natural resources, or

They tend to be telecommunications cables.</p>
<a name="time_19"></a>
<a name="90512-0010.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="09051261000143"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09051261000008"></a>The fourth scenario is activities relating to the laying and maintaining of those cables that are not connected with the exploration or exploitation of natural resources, or connected to an artificial island, installation or other structure, but parts of which are in the territorial sea. These sets of cables are covered by the amendment to which the noble Duke has just spoken. Under UNCLOS, a coastal state cannot apply any regulatory control over that part of these cables that lies outside of the territorial sea.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09051261000009"></a>For that part of these cables that lies inside the territorial sea, the coastal state can apply conditions to the laying of the cable for environmental protection reasons, but it cannot prevent the laying of that cable or regulate the maintenance of those cables. It is because of this restriction that Clause 78(2)(a) states that the licensing authority,</p>
<ul><a name="09051261000139"></a>&#147;must grant any application made to it&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09051261000099"></a>in respect of this part of those cables. Accepting the noble Duke&#146;s amendment would put us in breach of our obligations under the UN convention.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09051261000010"></a>Electricity transmission cables will need a marine licence from the appropriate marine licensing authority, unless they are considered ancillary to a nationally significant infrastructure project. In that case, development consent from the IPC covering the main project will also cover the ancillary transmission cables and deem a marine licence to be granted if the development is in English territorial waters or offshore waters adjacent to England or Wales.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09051261000011"></a>I hope that that is a full explanation. If the noble Duke wishes to consider it between now and Third Reading I would entirely understand, because of the complexity. We think that we have got it right in relation to the requirements under the UN convention.</p>

<a name="09051261000013"></a><b><a name="90512-0010.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09051261000152"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, in moving Amendment 102B I shall speak also to the amendments grouped with it. When we debated Clauses 88 and 103 in Committee, there was concern that the clause as drafted would not enable the environment to be restored to the condition it had been in before the harm or interference had been caused. If this interpretation were correct, it would mean that the clauses would not achieve the intention that we had agreed was appropriate, which was that people should be made to put right the harms that they have caused. I agreed to look at these clauses and have tabled these amendments to ensure that harm or interference can be properly addressed.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09051261000014"></a>Clause 88 enables the enforcement authority to issue a remediation notice to make someone remediate the harm they have caused where they have carried out a licensable activity and that activity has involved the commission of an offence under Clause 82(1). Perhaps the person breached the conditions of their licence and so damaged the environment, or perhaps they did not have a licence at all when they should have had.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09051261000015"></a>Clause 103 gives the licensing authority power to take remedial action. It enables the authority to carry out any works, whether these are to protect the environment or human health, or to prevent interference with legitimate uses of the sea, where a licensable activity has been undertaken without a licence. This power already exists under Schedule 10 of the Food and Environment Protection Act.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09051261000016"></a>My amendments amend Clause 88 to allow restoration of the environment under a remediation notice as well as providing for compensatory steps elsewhere if remediation at the site of harm itself is not reasonably practical. In my aims on enforcement under the Bill, I have been clear that enforcement action should be proportionate to the offence. Remediation notices should be proportionate to the scale of the harm to the environment, human health or interference to other legitimate uses of the sea. Financial gain by an offence should not be targeted by use of a remediation notice&#151;other provisions under this part, such as variable monetary penalties, allow such gain to be addressed.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09051261000017"></a>In some cases, the costs of restoration to the condition the environment was in prior to the harm or interference, even if technically possible, may be disproportionate to the benefits to be achieved. The ability to order remedial steps not directly connected to the harm itself reduces the likelihood of remediation notices being successfully challenged, on the basis that they are unreasonable according to all the circumstances of the case.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09051261000018"></a>I have also tabled Amendments 108A and 108B to Clause 103. This clause uses the same sort of wording as in Clause 88 and suffers from a similar risk of being interpreted in a narrow sense&#151;that the authority may only carry out works to protect what is left of the site, if anything, after the harm has been caused, rather than allowing it to put right the damage, or to prevent further harm, as intended.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09051261000019"></a>In addition to being able to take steps to protect what is left of the site of damage, I want authorities to be able to carry out remedial works for the purpose of preventing or minimising, or remedying or mitigating, the effects of harm to the environment or human  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_981"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 981</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>health, or interference with legitimate uses of the sea. Clearly, the ability to prevent further harm is a desirable objective, which, while it is unlikely to have frequent application, would be a noticeable gap in our provisions if we did not seek to plug it.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09051261000020"></a>The power to take protective or preventive works may be needed at the site of damage or elsewhere, such as in an area to where contaminated material has been transported. However, I have not extended the power to take compensatory steps away from damaged sites. We anticipate that the enforcement authority will need to use the power under Clause 103 instead of Clause 88 only where there is a particular need to do so; for example, where the offender cannot be readily identified. The extended nature of Clause 88 as amended is not needed for Clause 103, since we would expect the enforcement authority to use Clause 103 to take positive steps to address the harm caused, rather than to seek to compensate for it.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09051261000021"></a>I hope that noble Lords will accept that we have listened carefully to the debate in Committee and that my amendment meets the main points and concerns that were raised. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="09051261000022"></a><b><a name="90512-0010.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09051261000153"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I have tabled Amendment 103 in this group. Its purpose at the time I tabled it was to add the expression &#147;or restoring&#148; to Clause 88(9)(a). I am delighted to say that the Government have, as the Minister explained, tabled their own Amendment 103A which, except with one hesitation that I shall express in a moment, seems to cover the problem I had identified entirely. I am extremely grateful to the Minister for once again meeting our concern.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09051261000023"></a>My hesitation may be dispelled immediately by the Minister if he gives the reply that I hope he will. In his Amendment 103A, he uses the expression, at the beginning of the relevant paragraph,</p>
<ul><a name="09051261000140"></a>&#147;restoring (whether in whole or in part) the condition of any place affected by that harm or interference to the condition, or a condition reasonably similar to the condition, in which the place would have been had the harm or interference not occurred&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051261000100"></a>My question is this. What do the words &#147;whether in whole or in part&#148; mean? Do they mean, as I hope the Minister will say, that if part of the relevant location in the ocean&#151;and only part of it&#151;is damaged, then, plainly, only part of it needs to be restored? If that is what the amendment means, I am entirely content. If, however, it might be said to mean that the obligation to restore might be reduced, because of some set of circumstances, to only a partial restoration, then the Minister&#146;s amendment does not do what I would have thought would have been appropriate.</p>

I entirely understand why he has raised that point with me. We would usually want the enforcement authority to be able to require steps aimed towards restoring the site of damage to the state it was in before the harm occurred. This might consist of measures such as the dredging or capping of unlicensed deposits.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09051261000025"></a>One has to accept that taking such active steps to restore a condition at sea might not be possible; or it might cause further damage in taking the steps to do

However, if the harm is such that the site itself cannot or should not be restored, should that mean that an offender cannot be made to make some redress for the harm they have caused? We do not think that that is right, which is why my amendments allow for remedial steps to be ordered at a place other than where the harm occurred.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09051261000026"></a>In effect, these are steps taken at one place to compensate for damage caused in another. Such steps might be the installation of artificial reefs to make recompense for the damage to the seabed; or the case might be such that the authority wants the offender to make recompense the other way. I do not know whether that reassures the noble Lord, but the aim is to have a practical approach, starting from the premise that we want steps taken to restore the site of damage to the state it was in before the harm occurred. But there might be some circumstances where that is not entirely appropriate, and I aim to give those. That is why my amendment is worded as it is.</p>

<a name="90512-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09051261000027"></a>We have to develop enforcement guidance which will provide greater clarity for operators and allow for what, after all, is a developing area to be incorporated into practice. If the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is not satisfied, I would have to say to him that I believe that there is some room for a degree of flexibility here. </p>

I was not absolutely sure, because using &#147;compensatory&#148; suggests that if something is not perfect then it is nearly quid pro quo&#151;that you give something else where it cannot be renewed as it formerly was.

We are grateful that the Government have looked again at the whole question of remediation, and for the briefing that they sent us. In an interesting discussion of this in Committee, two different considerations were put forward that, in a sense, pulled in opposite directions. One was that the Bill was too prescriptive and needed more flexibility, which is the compensation point; on the other hand, it was suggested that the Bill did not clearly set out the powers to do what is sensible in a particular situation. Quite clearly, there will be situations where complete restoration is the right thing to do, situations&#151;quite small-scale, perhaps&#151;where compensation is the sensible thing, and other circumstances where prevention is required. In many cases, if it is a large and complex site, there might be a mixture of those; the ability to carry out work on a different part of the seabed, as opposed to the ruined part, is also valuable.</p>

<a name="90512-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09051261000034"></a>The problem, of course, is that that will all depend on what happens in practice and the decisions being made. The enforcing authorities may, in future, be too stringent&#151;probably not, in the view of some of us, yet other people might think that&#151;but in other cases they may let people off lightly. All that we can do is to put forward sensible legislation for a framework that allows what is sensible to take place, then hope that the enforcing authorities do the right thing in each case. There is no way that we can tie up in legislation every situation that will occur; we have to set the framework and urge that what is right is carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09051261000035"></a>My specific question is: although it is not set out in the legislation, will the Government think of giving some kind of guidance to the enforcing authorities, particularly the MMO, on how to carry out that work? It is very important that this is done effectively and quite rigorously, right from the beginning. Having said that, I welcome these government amendments.</p>

Having said that, noble Lords have raised some interesting questions; indeed, my noble friend Lord Kingsland has raised some in speaking to his own amendment. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response to those.</p>

It is always confusing when the Government move the first amendment in a group, which is why I got myself in a tangle there. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, may speak to his amendment when we come to it in the Marshalled List; in that case I shall respond then, if I may, to the substantive point that he raises. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, raised the question of whether what I had said in my original response to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, could be expressed in legislation. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, really answered that point; it would be difficult to do so, which is why we need flexibility.</p>

<a name="90512-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09051261000038"></a>Clearly, the licensing authorities themselves will need to issue guidance. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, then asked whether we, as the Government, should issue guidance to the MMO on that important issue. I take the noble Lord&#146;s point and will certainly consider it, because it is important that we understand what is meant on the circumstances in which remediation as opposed to restoration can take place, and the extent to which restoration is appropriate. I doubt whether we can go any further in legislative terms, but it would certainly be important for the MMO to understand the kind of issues that we are debating. Subject to our debate on the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, then, I hope that my amendment finds favour with your Lordships.</p>

The initial debate on this amendment has, in a sense, already taken place with my speaking to it in the appropriate group on the list, so I can take  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_985"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 985</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what the Minister has said about it as read. In the light of what he said, I have two questions. The first refers to the capacity to make a physical restoration and the second to the cost of having to make it. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the correct approach to the first question is to ask the following: can the damaged part of the sea be physically restored wholly, yes or no? If the answer is yes, I suggest that the correct approach, subject to the cost, is to undertake complete restoration. If it can be restored only in part, I suggest that the correct approach is the one which the Minister will find under the habitats directive, where the initial aim is to provide the appropriate mitigation or restoration within the damaged area, or the area which is likely to be damaged if the project goes ahead. If it is not possible to restore or to mitigate within the damaged area, there is a requirement in the habitats directive for the developer to find another part of the sea or the estuary where appropriate compensation can be made, so that within a reasonably well defined area of the sea what has been taken away by the developer in area A can be put back in area B. I would very much like the Minister to say that that is an appropriate parallel.</p>

<a name="90512-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09051261000040"></a>My more worrying concern is the passage of the Minister&#146;s speech referring to cost. He seemed to me to suggest that where an area is physically capable of being restored but the cost is exorbitant&#151;whatever exorbitant means&#151;there will be an obligation to restore it only in part. I hope that I have misunderstood the Minister. I perfectly understand that it might be said that where the cost of restoration was exorbitant, the decision-maker would give consideration to a proposal from a developer that he might make up for the part which is exorbitantly costly by providing an equivalent amount of environmental benefit elsewhere, in a sense, in conformity with what I said about the habitats directive. I would not be happy if the Minister simply says that, where the cost is exorbitant, nothing can be done. That seems to me to drive a coach and horses through the fundamental intention of the legislation so that all the principles which we set out at the beginning could be undermined by a diluted obligation on the wrongdoer to restore. I beg to move.</p>

It is a matter of how this is best expressed in legislation. He mentioned the habitats directive and I refer him to the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009, with which I am sure he is also very familiar. In those regulations, there is reference to what is called compensatory remediation. Perhaps I can give an example. If the offender has damaged a wetland breeding habitat for sea birds, we might want to specify as primary remediation that the offender takes certain steps to restore the site which is damaged. However, that may take some time to achieve and, in the mean time, the damaged site will not be available to bird life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09051261000042"></a>The Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 require compensatory remediation to recognise that loss. Therefore, we might also require that while the primary remediation is taking place, the offender takes steps to create a breeding

An example of what the 2009 regulations term &#147;complementary remediation&#148; is that, if an offender has damaged an area altering the conditions so as to render it unsuitable for animals and plants that used to live there, the authority might require him to create an artificial habitat such as a reef elsewhere. That is why I do not think that there is any disagreement between myself and the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90512-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09051261000043"></a>On resources, the point is that there may be a case&#151;it is always risky giving examples&#151;where the damage is slight but the expense is great. In those circumstances, I argue that there needs to be flexibility. I do not think that there is a reason for us to disagree. If the noble Lord is still not satisfied, I am content, without commitment, to consider the matter further before Third Reading, although I am not sure that is entirely necessary.</p>

It will effectively, as he says, remove vessels registered in British Overseas Territories from the need to obtain a marine licence from the Secretary of State when they are depositing, scuttling or incinerating in waters outside the UK marine licensing area. We have, as the noble Lord indicated, an obligation under international agreements to ensure that adequate environmental controls apply to British Overseas Territories and their vessels. However, the territories are already obliged, under the Environment Protection (Overseas Territories) Order 1988, made under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, to license vessels registered in their territory for depositing, incinerating or scuttling outside their waters. Therefore, needing a marine licence from the Secretary of State under the Bill would constitute dual licensing. I welcome the clarity that this amendment brings to the Bill and the licensing arrangements faced by vessels registered in overseas territories. I am therefore happy to accept the amendment.</p>

This is the part that deals with marine conservation zones. I have brought this amendment back, first, because I believe that the terminology is, in itself very unhelpful in discussing what is meant by marine conservation zones. Secondly, the Government are still denying the MMO a vital tool in the box. I thank the Minister for sending the various pieces of draft Defra guidance around; it was very helpful. Having said that, it increased my fear that the terminology is mixed up here; it really should be better defined in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09051261000054"></a>In the beginning, when we talked about marine conservation zones, we were just talking about something that would improve dramatically the conservation effort in marine areas. There were some impassioned speeches, notably by the noble Lord, Lord Eden of Winton, in Committee. I will not rehearse all the reasons why we should have this strong effort towards conservation. However, there are zones in the Bill that can be designated as marine conservation zones at the moment, but all sorts of activities can still apply to take place within  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_991"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 991</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them. That is fine; there are many places where lots of activities may still be applicable. There may be one sort of fishing denied and another sort admitted. There may be no dredging at all. Recreational activities may be fine. There is a whole gamut of things.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09051261000055"></a>However, then we come to those places that I think the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, referred to in Committee as &#147;pristine&#148;. The Defra guidance now has a new word for it, which is &#147;naturalness&#148;. These are places that really have not been disturbed at all. If you have a zone that really exhibits that, and which has lots of rare species and all or many of the other things that Defra has on its list, surely that place has a claim to being a highly protected marine zone, where it is pointless to apply for a licence because you simply should not be granted it. Any human activity that encroached on the place would spoil it. It should be in the MMO&#146;s power to designate such a zone straight away.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09051261000056"></a>I think that there is still confusion around this subject. Defra&#146;s guidance, <I>Delivering Marine Conservation Zones and Marine Protected Areas</I>, refers to marine protected areas&#146; benefits for fisheries. The place that it quotes, again and again throughout this&#151;and under benefits for tourism&#151;is the Lundy no-take zone. If there is one example of a highly protected area, this is it. You cannot extrapolate everything about marine conservation zones from one highly protected area. It would be terrific to achieve the objective of all our seas being as they are around Lundy. However, when the Government talk about designating marine conservation zones, it is not a realistic aim at this point to say that this is where they believe that they will be, even by 2020, let alone 2012.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09051261000057"></a>Lundy is a particular place. There will be other places around the coast that scientific evidence will show should be a highly protected zone. That is why the Bill needs to give this tool to the MMO, so that it can say that most places that demonstrate good reasons and scientific evidence for having particular protection will simply be marine conservation zones, where licences can be applied for and may be granted if they will not be damaging. However, there will be a few special places that should have absolutely nothing granted that will damage their naturalness or pristineness at all. For example, around Lundy, you cannot even drop an anchor; you must attach to a buoy. I am interested to hear why the Government want to deny the MMO this one very important tool. It has been proved internationally. Every time that the benefits of highly protected areas are widely quoted, it is because they are very highly protected and there is no human activity in them.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09051261000058"></a>The Wildlife Trusts produced a very attractive brochure, <I>Marine Reserves</I>, which covered what they had campaigned for. The section &#147;Do marine reserves work?&#148; mentions 160 of the world&#146;s most eminent marine experts assessing work and deciding that full protection is critical to achieve the full range of benefits. It highlighted that the last point is the important one. The full range of benefits may not always be possible for social or economic reasons, but where the science is driving you to say that an area deserves the full range of benefits, it deserves full protection.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09051261000061"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government have already confirmed that in Wales a marine conservation zone designation will be used to establish some highly protected sites and zones. Such sites have the greatest potential for delivering biodiversity and the example given by my noble friend of Lundy Island is outstanding. It is well known on both sides of the Severn estuary that, because of the no-take zone, the quality of the fish stocks and biodiversity in Lundy sets a good example throughout the whole of the British Isles. Indeed, I know examples of a similar kind in New Zealand which have produced similar quality results.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09051261000062"></a>The Countryside Council for Wales, which advises the Welsh Assembly Government, believes it is particularly important for Wales that the Bill enables and supports the creation of highly protected zones in the way described in the amendment. I agree that the inclusion of highly protected zones would be a welcome improvement to the Bill. It would provide a benefit for the Welsh marine ecosystem and could be pursued throughout the waters around the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="st_225"></a>
<a name="09051261000063"></a><b><a name="90512-0012.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09051261000184"></a>Baroness Young of Old Scone:</b> My Lords, I support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. I used to be completely dubious about highly protected marine conservation zones. I was not convinced that it was necessary&#151;this will be music to the Minister&#146;s ears&#151;to have this provision in the Bill. A number of groups tried to persuade me otherwise and, of all the arguments I heard, one changed my mind considerably and I now believe that the Government should fulfil the commitment they made in their response to the Joint Committee report to include a reference to such sites in the Bill. They have not carried out that commitment.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09051261000064"></a>The reason I was persuaded otherwise was rather bizarre. I, too, commend the very good book produced by the Wildlife Trust movement, but other groups spoke to me about this. We are still in the infancy of marine conservation science. We do not know very much about what goes on under the sea; we do not have good baseline information; and we do not know the true richness of our seas, particularly those closer to our coasts, or what they are capable of because we have not got a memory that goes back to a time when they were not quite heavily exploited, particularly by fisheries. So, unless we get some sites where economic activity is excluded&#151;they do not need to be extensive&#151;and the absolute requirement is that nature be allowed to bounce back to whatever level it naturally bounces back to, we will not know what the marine environment is capable of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09051261000065"></a>We all bang on about Lundy, but it is the only live experiment of that kind that we have had so far and it is not a particularly good one. But the richness, size and robustness of the marine ecosystem that was generated as a result of excluding fishing and lobster exploitation from that area should encourage the Minister to go back to the original intention in the Government&#146;s response to the Joint Committee and signal to the Secretary of State that some highly protected areas are desirable and should be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09051261000068"></a>I want to say two or three very quick things about the amendment. First, generally, I thought my noble friend Lady Miller was a little dismissive about the bits of paper that the Government have sent round to us. I think that the latest mailing we have had from the Government on marine conservation zones is extremely helpful and shows how far and how quickly the thinking and work is progressing. We received the latest version of the draft strategy on <I>Delivering Marine Conservation Zones and European Marine Sites</I> and the draft guidance on S<I>election and </I><I>D</I><I>esignation of </I><I>M</I><I>arine</I> C<I>onservation </I><I>Z</I><I>ones</I><I> (N</I><I>ote 1</I><I>)</I>&#151;one in a series of how many, I wonder. The fact that we have received these in time for Report stage here and that they will be available before the whole of the debate in the House of Commons is extremely useful. Those who have obviously been putting in a large amount of work in producing all this documentation and those who are carrying out work on the ground and in the sea are to be commended.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09051261000069"></a>Secondly, the Government seem to be implying in their briefings that there is not much difference between us. They are saying that there will be a spectrum of marine conservation zones&#151;or perhaps a kaleidoscope of them&#151;which will all have their own individual regimes, rules and regulations and will be different in each case. Some of them will be highly protected at one end and some will be protected for only one purpose at the other end. We understand that. However, the reason there should be a small number of special zones is partly symbolic and partly a declaration that there are some areas where, no matter what people put forward and what they argue, the answer is no. They are special areas, based on the science and on the facts, and are qualitatively different from all other zones, which will be bespoke in the sense that their regimes will vary based on what is in them.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09051261000070"></a>There will be relatively few special places where the regime is absolute, and that is the difference of opinion between us. I think that difference will run to the end of the Bill, and I hope that the Government will find ways of moving on this. They say that they do not want a two-tier system; we are not talking about a two-tier system. Having a relatively few special areas will not in any way detract from whatever regime there may be in all the other areas. The argument that if you

I have not had the conversion that came fortuitously to the noble Baroness, Lady Young. Not for me the possibility of seeing this differently from my initial reaction.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09051261000072"></a>I understand the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that marine conservation zones should be, when appropriate, of suitable strength properly to protect the environment over which they are established. I also understand the important and often significantly underappreciated contribution that pristine areas, or areas of naturalness, can make to the overall ecosystem. I, too, hope that, in designating the network, the appropriate authority will have the will and power to impose the necessary restrictions over the features that we are seeking to conserve. Listening to the arguments presented by noble Lords only reinforced my view that within marine conservation zones will be many specific designations. Therefore, I still hold the view that I expressed in Committee: that establishing a two-tier system&#151;as it would be if there were two different levels of designation&#151;where the appropriate authority would have to weigh up whether a habitat was worthy of a higher status of protection would be counterproductive.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09051261000073"></a>MCZs will, I hope, be flexible, targeted webs of different restrictions, changing over time for many reasons. Migratory habits, ever-improving scientific knowledge, the impact of global warming and even the recovery of some features will all make necessary the review of by-laws and planning decisions. Adding another arbitrary feature that would need to be changed would not add to the network but instead make it a little more cumbersome and unresponsive. My later amendment, to Clause 119, to tighten up the duty to designate a network, is my preferred way forward.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09051261000074"></a>I hope that the Minister will reassure us that what the noble Baroness seeks in her amendment can happen anyway. There is, I presume, no top limit on the amount of restriction that the appropriate authority can impose on an area of sea. If the habitat is found to be so vulnerable and so valuable that it is decided that the only way to protect it is to prevent all activity in that area, that is, as I understand it, possible under the existing drafting.</p>

The Government fully understand the intent of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, but are concerned that it could have perverse consequences. I generally plead with the House to be very cautious about going down the two-tier route and causing confusion and difficulties in putting the legislation into practice. That, I think, is the argument between us.</p>

As I have said, I do not believe that there is disagreement between us on the principles. We believe that the powers in the Bill are broad enough in appropriate cases to protect marine conservation zones from all damaging human activities. I can assure the House that the Bill allows for this. We have heard mentioned a number of times the marine nature reserves at Lundy and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, suggested, they are highly protected by anyone&#146;s standards. However, I cannot see how the Bill as it is currently drafted would in any way cause a reduction in those standards of protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09051261000078"></a>Clause 113(1) states that the appropriate authority&#151;for England, this is the Secretary of State&#151;may designate marine conservation zones. It applies no restrictions on the power of the appropriate authority to set stringent restrictions. Clause 120(2)(c) refers to the requirement to report to Parliament and talks specifically of areas where licensable or extractive activities are prohibited. Licensing conditions can be set under Clause 68(3). They can be as stringent as necessary and they will come under the duty of public authorities in Clause 121 to best further or least hinder the conservation objectives of each marine conservation zone.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09051261000079"></a>I accept, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said, that there is much scientific knowledge that we need to seek and understand in the years ahead. It is therefore very important that the flexibility exists for the restrictions to change over time. We accept that the levels of restriction required to achieve conservation objectives can change over time, and the Bill, as drafted, allows us to change the conditions. If because of the science it is necessary for further conditions to be set, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent it.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09051261000080"></a>I come to the two-tier approach. As I have said, we have deliberately designed the marine conservation zones as a flexible mechanism that can be tailored to deliver the precise level of protection needed by the features of each individual site. We think that a two-tier approach is not only unnecessary but could undermine the flexibility which is fundamental to our vision for marine conservation zones.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09051261000081"></a>As I have said already, we have debated on many occasions the complexity of the marine environment, how our understanding of it is still developing and how our seas are changing in the face of climate change and other factors. Each new scientific study reveals more of the complexities of the living environment in our seas. The dynamic nature of the marine environment means that the levels of protection for individual sites will need to change over time. We therefore need flexibility. Noble Lords should not be concerned that such flexibility will mean that, where we need high protection and very stringent conditions, those conditions will not be applied, because they can be and will be.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09051261000082"></a>The problem with the two-tier approach is, first, bureaucracy, where the level of protection for marine conservation needs to change in the light of new information. A two-tier approach would require all kinds of processes to enable a zone to be designated in

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09051261000083"></a>Moreover, the two-tier approach does not fit comfortably with the fact that there may need to be different levels of protection within the same site, either at different times of the year or in different parts of the site. The noble Baroness said that if one had a highly protected zone, as in her amendment, it would make it clear to potential applicants for licences that they would have very little chance of success, thereby creating greater certainty. However, I come back to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that it could also cause a lot of confusion. There is a risk of the lower designation of marine conservation zone being taken to imply that the zone has less conservation value. That is not the case: these zones will be as vital to our network as zones with the highest level of protection. There is a real danger that ordinary marine conservation zones&#151;or lower marine conservation zones, as I describe them&#151;would receive a lower level of legal protection. That would be a problem.</p>

<a name="90512-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09051261000084"></a>I feel very strongly about this and I know that the noble Baroness does, too. I assure her that nothing in the Bill prevents an MCZ being designated with the kind of conditions that she wishes to see. It is a genuine concern that her well meant amendment could lead to perverse incentives. Again, the disagreement is not on principle, but simply on the impact that her amendment would have.</p>

His comments about Wales will be the shining example that shows the Government what a trick they are missing here. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, because a conversion is probably worth as much as the huge number of us who already thought as we did. She is absolutely right about the evidence of nature bouncing back; that is a good way of putting it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09051261000086"></a>My noble friend Lord Greaves, who supported me, seemed to think that I was dismissive of Defra&#146;s guidance; and perhaps I did not say enough about it. It was extremely useful in spelling out the different categories of ecological significance&#151;high natural and biological diversity, representivity, sensitivity, naturalness and so on&#151;because this gave us a flavour of how Defra sees a marine conservation zone working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09051261000087"></a>I was extremely disappointed when those on the Conservative Front Bench said that they would not support this. They said that it would establish a two-tier system and would be counterproductive. However, in the terrestrial area there are many protective tiers, such as SSSIs and AONBs, that protect the landscape. National parks protect social activities within a special landscape, and the landscape itself. We are used to working with different tiers to protect and conserve. It is not a new concept, and I am astonished that those on the Conservative Front Bench, who have often talked volubly about conservation matters, and even worked with us on the CROW Act to further their aims, are now withdrawing from them in the context of the marine landscape. That is extremely disappointing.</p>

We are reasoning on the argument, and I am afraid that the argument presented in her amendment does not warrant our support. We believe in a high level of protection, and we believe that the Bill provides us with a better chance of achieving that protection than her amendment would facilitate. Indeed, it could be a threat to protection elsewhere. I wish that she had listened to the arguments that I presented.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09051261000090"></a>The Minister said that he did not want a two-tier system, but there will be a multi-tier system. I am asking simply for recognition in legislation of the top tier. The Government are ignoring the evidence from around the world that for full benefits, you need full protection. That experiment can never take place unless you recognise it.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09051261000091"></a>The Minister stated that there could be changing levels of protection over time. That is exactly what I am afraid of. If you have an area that is exhibiting what Defra calls,</p>
<ul><a name="09051261000142"></a>&#147;a high degree of naturalness, with species and habitats ... still in a very natural state as a result of the lack of human-induced disturbance or degradation&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09051261000101"></a>a changing level of protection over time could only mean a lessening level of protection. In other areas, it might mean that the damage occurs first, and then you protect it later. In some areas&#151;</p>

It might also mean that, in the light of experience or new scientific knowledge, the protection of some marine conservation zones may be mightily enhanced. The noble Baroness is arguing for two different designations; I believe that it is much better to have a more flexible approach where, in the cases of the marine areas that the noble Baroness has referred to, you can make stringent conditions in relation to licensable activities. The problem with the approach of the noble Baroness is that it would lead to greater confusion. As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, suggested, a perverse incentive could result from having an ordinary&#151;or lower&#151;level marine conservation zone.</p>

It is not what I think that counts, but what the scientists in all the countries in the world who did the work&#151;particularly in New Zealand&#151;came out with. It is universally recognised that there are places where you need a level of protection against, for example, trawling, but where many other activities could take place. In a normal conservation zone you could admit human activity such as sailing, canoeing and so on, and the species and what you are trying to protect in that area of sea will be fine. Other areas will merit a higher level of protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09051261000094"></a>I can see that I will not win the argument with the Government. We have failed to get Conservative support. However, all those people who lobbied so hard for the Bill&#151;for example, members of the Wildlife Trust or the Marine Conservation Society, and others who simply want to see marine areas deliver what science has proved that they can&#151;will need to lobby their MPs and see if this can be changed in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09051261000095"></a>I can see some of the Minister&#146;s argument, but behind it are other worries.

However, I will reassure her on this matter. I know that she has strong views about the Crown Estate, which we might be debating later. The Government&#146;s attitude has nothing to do with concerns expressed by the Crown Estate or any other body. We want this to work and we think that we have the right mechanism. In the cases that the noble Baroness described, where a very high level of protection is required, there is nothing in this Bill or anything that any Minister has said that detracts from that possibility. She needs to be very careful about the kind of perverse incentives that would be put in place if we had a two-tier approach to the system.</p>

Let me explain the occasion that prompted me to initiate this debate. It was the news last summer  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_999"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 999</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that Ministers would table a number of late amendments to the Counter-Terrorism Bill 2008. The object was to make 42 days of detention more palatable to the House of Commons Back-Benchers by strengthening the safeguards through parliamentary scrutiny. In new Clause 26, it proposed that the chairmen of three Commons Select Committees should receive confidential briefing on Privy Council terms. In the event, Part 2 of the Bill was abandoned, and I am not pursuing the substance of the matter. My long-standing concern&#151;I had it long before the BBC thought up this morning&#146;s Radio 4 programme&#151;is the wider role of privy counsellors. I want to know what privy counsellors are for.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09051274000004"></a>Is membership of the Privy Council a titular honour&#151;&#147;the right honourable&#148;&#151;and a reward for public and political service, which is usually assumed? Or does it have, or should it have, a potentially significant function within the processes of government? I have wondered about this since I became a privy counsellor more than 30 years ago.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09051274000005"></a>I refer, if I may, to my own experience. In a conversation with Harold Wilson, then Prime Minister, when he proposed to make me Minister of State for Defence, I asked whether I would become a privy counsellor. He hesitated for a moment and then said, &#147;Soon&#148;. I saw it as he saw it&#151;as an honour&#151;and I was very pleased when I was appointed a year or so later. But on the very day of the announcement of my appointment, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence, Sir Hermann Bondi, came into my office and said that he was delighted because I could now take the chair for a crucial and difficult meeting to resolve a dispute between the scientists and the Navy over the top-secret Chevaline nuclear weapons project. Clearly, I now had a practical and very sensitive role, although it seemed that I had been appointed a privy counsellor only as an honour.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09051274000006"></a>In due course, I must have taken the privy counsellor oath to &#147;keep secret all matters&#148; and to defend Her Majesty against,</p>
<ul><a name="09051274000109"></a>&#147;all Foreign Princes, Persons, Prelates, States, or Potentates&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051274000097"></a>But I was still the same man. I had been positively vetted and had read top secret telegrams years before when I was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Foreign Office. So, on the face of it, you could deal with highly confidential and security matters before becoming a privy counsellor. The members of the council all seem eminently respectable, but not necessarily men and women best suited to deal with security matters.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09051274000007"></a>I shall look at some of the members of the present Government and assume that membership of the Privy Council is the dividing line between taking the Privy Council oath&#151;proposed for the three chairmen in new Clause 26&#151;and not having done so.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09051274000008"></a>The Counter-Terrorism Bill was taken through this House by the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, whose special responsibilities include counterterrorism, science and technology. But he is not a privy counsellor; he is on the wrong side of the line, despite his distinguished, very senior naval career. Is he not appropriate or permitted to deal with such secret matters? My noble friend Lord Carlile of Berriew, though not a Minister,  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1000"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1000</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is appointed to be the independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation. He is certainly involved in secret matters but, like the noble Lord, Lord West, he is not a privy counsellor. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, is a privy counsellor as Attorney-General, and deals with a wide range of sensitive matters, but the Solicitor-General, Vera Baird MP, is not, although she may be required to exercise exactly the same statutory powers as the Attorney-General. Is she not appropriate or permitted to deal with such legal and justice matters, discussing them with the Home Secretary or the Lord Chancellor? Of course, it is nonsense.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09051274000009"></a>On 5 October last, a press notice came from No. 10 saying that Her Majesty the Queen had approved eight new privy counsellors. I shall not mention their names now, because I am concerned only with the principle, but several of them moved up the ministerial ladder, several moved sideways, and one left the Government altogether. What common quality was there between the eight who entered the Privy Council? I can find none. There are some 550 members of the Privy Council, but there is no limit to numbers and 42 new appointments were made in the past two years. The Prime Minister of the day can appoint whoever he likes, and as many as he likes, with no explanation. There is an elaborate and lengthy bureaucratic process by which suitable men and women are carefully considered with a view to an honour at the New Year and the Queen&#146;s Speech. They extend from an MBE to a Companion of Honour&#151;a CH&#151;but candidates for the Privy Council are not included. The Prime Minister makes the decisions and recommends the names to the Queen&#151;and, following tradition, includes the two distinguished Prelates, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, and the Bishop of London.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09051274000010"></a>All privy counsellors are equal, but some seem to be more equal than others. In a debate on the Civil Contingencies Bill in 2004, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, speaking for the Government, said that a &#147;senior privy counsellor&#148; would annually review the operation of the Act. It was news to me that there were junior and senior privy counsellors. I would therefore be grateful if the Lord President could confirm who are the junior and who the senior privy counsellors. Is it a matter of chronology in appointment, or is there some other factor?</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09051274000011"></a>If the Prime Minister refers to Privy Council briefing, as he sometimes does, it does not mean all members of the council but a selected few. When the council meets at Buckingham Palace in the presence of the Queen to transact legislative business, only a handful of ministerial privy counsellors attend. If others tried to join them, they would be excluded, although all privy counsellors are supposed to have direct access to Her Majesty.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09051274000012"></a>I remember a splendid banquet in the Royal Gallery of the House on the Queen&#146;s Jubilee, when all members of the Privy Council seem to have been invited, but there has been no other collective occasion for very many years. The whole council is summoned to a formal meeting only to proclaim a new monarch or to consent to a Royal marriage. Privy counsellors play no part in the Privy Council Office and I am sure that most of them have never visited it.</p>

<a name="09051274000015"></a><b><a name="90512-0013.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09051274000124"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, on raising this question. This is a timely opportunity to look at what privy counsellors do and, perhaps of greater importance, what they could do. In some respects, privy counsellors are similar to the Members of the House of Lords. I appreciate that the two categories are by no means mutually exclusive. Privy counsellors comprise a large body of distinguished public servants&#151;not quite as many as Members of the House of Lords but, at approximately 550, still a large number&#151;and have an institutional framework. They also have a judicial arm. Like in the House of Lords, meetings are subject to a small quorum.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09051274000016"></a>However, unlike the House of Lords, the Privy Council is arguably a somewhat shapeless body, certainly not one that is utilised as effectively as it might be. The council itself, as the noble Lord indicated, has an important formal role. As Bradley and Ewing note in the 14th edition of <I>Consti</I><I>tutional and Administrative Law</I>:</p>
<ul><a name="09051274000100"></a>&#147;the Order in Council remains an important method of giving the force of law to acts of the government, especially the more significant executive orders&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90512-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09051274000017"></a>The role of privy counsellors, other than the four or so summoned to attend meetings of the council, is less clear. There appear to be two principal purposes for creating privy counsellors. One is as a reward for notable public service. In this sense, being made a member of the Privy Council is an honour on a scale similar to some others announced in the Queen&#146;s Birthday and New Year&#146;s Honours Lists. The other is to enable members to be briefed confidentially, not least on issues of national security. The crucial element is the oath, which I gather dates from 1250 and which, to quote Peter Hennessy in his massive tome titled <I>Whitehall</I>, &#147;has life and bite&#148;. He sees it, somewhat negatively, as encouraging closed government, but it does enable confidential information to be shared. That is the reason for making the leaders of opposition parties privy counsellors and, on occasion, other parliamentarians and sometimes people outside Parliament. In the 1970s, Len Murray, the general-secretary of the TUC&#151;later Lord Murray&#151;was made a privy counsellor to facilitate consultation on government policy. It also justifies the composition of the Intelligence and Security Committee.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09051274000018"></a>There does not appear to be much beyond that in terms of a functional role, and even that utility is sporadic rather than regular. It is, in effect, an underused resource. What I wish to raise is how it may be used in the future.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09051274000019"></a>There have been occasions when privy counsellors have been drawn on to form or participate in public inquiries. Non-statutory inquiries undertaken by a panel of privy counsellors include the inquiry into the interrogation of terrorists, under Lord Parker of Waddington, in 1971; the Falklands Islands review, under Lord Franks, in 1982; and the review of intelligence on weapons of mass destruction, under the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, in 2004. There are various advantages to utilising privy counsellors in this way. There is a substantial pool on which to draw. One can utilise privy counsellors with relevant skills, including those of forensic questioning. Utilising a panel of privy counsellors has advantages over the use of judicial and parliamentary inquiries. Inquiries by judges can make a substantial drain on judicial resources, especially where, as in the Saville inquiry, they are lengthy and, if on contentious issues, may draw judges into areas of public and political controversy. Parliamentary committees are not necessarily geared to fault-finding exercises and may not be in a position to receive confidential information. Demands on members&#146; time may also prevent them being able to<I></I>engage in scrutiny of large numbers of documents and embark on time-consuming inquiries.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09051274000020"></a>There are thus advantages to drawing on privy counsellors to undertake certain inquiries. This has been recognised, not least by the Public Administration Committee in the other place. In its report on <I>Government by Inquiry </I>in 2005, it recommended that inquiries into the conduct of Government should not be left to Ministers, but rather should be undertaken by a parliamentary commission of inquiry composed of parliamentarians and others. It acknowledged the problems associated with inquiries undertaken by Select Committees.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09051274000021"></a>It returned to the subject in its 9th report of last Session on <I>Parliamentary Commissions of</I><I></I><I>lnquiry</I>, arguing that Parliament should devise a mechanism so that it could instigate, as necessary, parliamentary commissions of inquiry with enforceable powers to summon witnesses and access papers and to meet in private, as necessary. It argued in paragraph 7:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_162"></a><a name="09051274000101"></a>&#147;Inquiries initiated by Parliament are especially suitable for investigating topics that have a political dimension. As we have already observed, it is more legitimate and serves the interests of accountability more effectively for Parliament, rather than the Executive, to inquire into the actions of executive government. Where politically sensitive subjects are concerned, parliamentary inquiries are also preferable to judicial ones&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09051274000022"></a>It also turned to the issue of membership and here was more explicit than in its earlier report. It recommended in paragraph 17, and I quote the recommendation in full:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_163"></a><a name="09051274000102"></a>&#147;We believe that decisions about the membership and chairmanship of a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry should be undertaken carefully in order to avoid the Inquiry being undermined by partisanship or political concerns. To operate effectively, a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry should consist of a Committee of Privy Counsellors appointed by Parliament. Individuals could be made Privy Counsellors in order to serve on  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1003"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1003</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an inquiry of this nature. Members should be drawn from both Houses of Parliament, with external members appointed where appropriate for their specialist expertise&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09051274000023"></a>In its response in October of last year, the Government noted that creating such commissions was essentially a matter for Parliament, although it did say that it did not share the committee&#146;s view that it was more legitimate and serves the interests of accountability more effectively for Parliament, rather than the Executive, to inquire into the actions of executive government. It offered no justification for its view and seemed unaware that the very basis of the case for parliamentary inquiry was implicit in its own observation. There is an obvious case to be made that the executive inquiring into the executive is not the best basis for enhancing public confidence in an inquiry.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09051274000024"></a>On membership of a parliamentary commission of inquiry comprising privy counsellors, the Government&#146;s response noted that membership of the Privy Council was conferred by the Queen, acting on the advice of Ministers. It continued:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_164"></a><a name="09051274000103"></a>&#147;There would be an issue to be considered about whether it would be appropriate to confer this status on someone for the purposes of undertaking a specific task. Parliament itself could not make a recommendation for Privy Council membership, still less confer the status&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051274000098"></a>There are two responses to this. First, the Butler commission was established to fulfil a specific task and membership of the Privy Council was conferred on those members who were not already privy counsellors. Secondly, the occasions when a commission is formed with one or more members who are not privy counsellors may be extremely rare and, if necessary, may be engineered in order not to be necessary at all. Given the size and quality of the existing membership of the Privy Council, there should be little difficulty crafting a panel comprising parliamentarians and some outside experts, all of whom are privy counsellors.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09051274000025"></a>The idea of utilising privy counsellors in this way is not new. In his book <I>Constitutional </I><I>Practice</I>, published in 1988, Professor Rodney Brazier wrote that some inquiries would be better undertaken by senior privy counsellors on behalf of Parliament. The proposal thus has some serious support.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09051274000026"></a>My basic point is that there is a case for making greater use of privy counsellors, utilising them in effect as a standing panel, available to be drawn on as appropriate to form parliamentary commissions of inquiry. That may not necessarily be their only use. Some bodies have suggested drawing on them for other purposes. There may be a case for a wider review of what use can be made of the Privy Council, but there is already a clear case for utilising it for what it is&#151;a repository of knowledge, drawing on senior public servants drawn from a wide range of backgrounds.</p>

<a name="90512-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09051274000027"></a>The case for creating parliamentary commissions of inquiry composed of privy counsellors is ultimately a matter for Parliament rather than government. However, as the Lord President of the Council is replying to the debate, she is in a position to offer what I trust will be a helpful response.</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1004"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1004</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>By so doing, there is the added benefit that he coaxes the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, away from academia to put on record his forward thoughts, which are always of interest and importance. As the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, himself mentioned, we have the excellent timing that Mr Quentin Letts asked pretty well the same question as we are asking on Radio 4 this morning. I understand that you can still hear that programme on the piece of machinery that my teenage son understands but that I have not yet managed to get to work. I am beginning to sound like those old judges who asked &#147;who are the Beatles?&#148;, but noble Lords know what I mean.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90512-0014.htm"/>


<a name="90512-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09051274000029"></a>The programme posed the question, as did the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers: what are privy counsellors for? Certainly, when you look into the matter, there are shades of Blackadder about the paraphernalia around the Privy Council. I found it of interest that we have some 550 privy counsellors today, whereas Henry VIII made do with about 40. On the other hand, it was a whole lot more dangerous to be a privy counsellor for Henry VIII. Also, and this has run through both contributions so far, there is a seriousness about the Privy Council and its powers.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09051274000030"></a>First, as the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, rightly acknowledged, there is a powerful power of patronage for the Prime Minister in being able to grant the title &#147;right honourable&#148;. I remember when I worked for Mr Callaghan, as Lord Callaghan then was, as an adviser in 10 Downing Street, he asked me to sound out a Labour Member of Parliament about whether he would like an honour. I always remember that the MP said to me, &#147;There is only one honour I&#146;m interested in and that is &#145;the right honourable&#146; in front of my name&#148;. That is true of most practising parliamentary politicians. In the programme that I referred to, Michael Portillo said that &#147;right hon.&#148; was the best club badge that you could get in the Westminster village, and I think that that is true.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09051274000031"></a>It would not really matter much if the council were no more than that&#151;a quaint anachronism, one of the more dignified parts of our constitution or, as Quentin Letts, in his usual fashion put rather cruelly this morning, a prize for the fading &#147;alumni of Parliament&#148;. There is also, as the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, pointed out, a real advantage in having the council as a ready store of licensed secret keepers for use in inquiries. The points that he made this evening bear further consideration as we look at constitutional and parliamentary reform. Those were worthwhile ideas.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09051274000032"></a>However, there is a more serious accusation against the Privy Council&#151;that it is a loophole in our democracy and accountability. This morning, in that well listened-to programme, Mr Jack Straw confessed that the Privy Council could be used in &#147;exchanging legitimacy for speed&#148;. He was referring to the particular instance of the use of the Privy Council in the case of Diego Garcia and the right of return of the Chagos islanders to their homeland. It is one single example, but it is such a shameful example that it bears examination. A group of citizens won their case in the courts of law yet the shadier part of our constitution provided by the Privy Council allowed that decision to be overturned and then upheld by this House.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1005"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1005</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90512-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09051274000033"></a>Tonight is not the time to examine the sad story of Diego Garcia in detail, but the more that is revealed of that story over 40 years, the more shameful it is for successive Governments of all political hues. However, it is right to ask whether the way that Privy Council powers were used does not shine a harsh spotlight on its powers and its uses by government. I await with interest the constitutional reform Bill, where we may be able to look at some of these matters.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09051274000034"></a>I remember in the 1980s and 1990s Mr Tony Benn having a strong campaign to abolish the royal prerogatives. At that stage, I tended to have a powerful Pavlovian reaction that anything Mr Benn proposed must automatically be wrong, but since then I have begun to review my position. The royal prerogatives&#151;the Privy Council powers&#151;create a loophole in our constitution, which is a weakness in terms of parliamentary democracy. I suspect that successive Governments have clung to this apparent anachronism not from a desire to protect the monarch from radical parliamentarians, but as a way of protecting themselves from parliamentary scrutiny. Although we have had some interesting comments about the more pleasant aspects of being called right honourable, being a member of the Privy Council and having this parliamentary badge, we must also look, particularly as we look towards the constitutional reform Bill, at whether some of the powers of the Privy Council are not in fact a useful smokescreen for an Executive who want to avoid parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

I have not been a privy counsellor for quite as long as him. I have been a privy counsellor for almost precisely 30 years and, like him, I have attended a good many meetings of small groups of the Privy Council with Her Majesty. While I hope profoundly that I enjoy a long life, I hope equally profoundly that I never have to attend the one great meeting of the Privy Council on the death of the sovereign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09051274000036"></a>Having listened to the debate, I honestly think we are making far too much of it. It is all a bit of a red herring. We heard the noble Lord, Lord Rogers, talking about the moment, that great moment in the Ministry of Defence, when he became a privy counsellor and he was allowed to talk about nuclear matters. We then heard about senior members of the armed services who are not privy counsellors, who are clearly involved in all this. The fact that these matters are allowed to be shared with a privy counsellor in the Ministry of Defence is a total, unnecessary red herring&#151;I think it is rubbish.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09051274000037"></a>My old friend, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, talked about Members of Parliament who felt that the greatest accolade was to have &#147;right honourable&#148; in front of their name. I have to tell him exactly the opposite. In the days when, like him, I was working down at the other end of the building, one heard of Members of Parliament who were offered privy counsellorship who said&#151;this is all apocryphal, you would not want me to enlarge on this&#151;no, no, they would much prefer an knighthood because they wanted recognition for their wives. There are two sides to all of this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09051274000038"></a>We heard about privy counsellor-only committees. I suggest to your Lordships that that is just a convenience. If you did not have privy counsellor-only committees, much the same people&#151;because of their distinction, apart from being privy counsellors&#151;would still be put onto committees of that sort. I was once what was, down at the other end of the building, rather rudely called the Patronage Secretary. I think privy counsellorship is a charming accolade bestowed on people of distinction. The problem with it is that it is much too narrow. Far too many privy counsellorships are directed to people who are active in this very building. I would like to see a much wider group of people considered for privy counsellorships, right across the activities of the nation. The distinguished people in the nation are not just the people who work in this building. There are far too many people appointed to privy counsellorship within this building, and I would like to see it widened very much.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09051274000039"></a>I take huge pride in the fact that I am a privy counsellor, and I do not want my remarks to suggest that I do not think that it is a matter of tremendous pride. It is, and anyone who has the privilege of being a privy counsellor understands that it is something very much to be prized.</p>

He seemed to focus, to a considerable degree, on the distinction&#151;it is an important distinction&#151;between the functional role of privy counsellors and the honorific role. The list of privy counsellors, which now exceeds 500, we are told, plainly contains members who fall into both categories.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09051274000041"></a>What should the extent of the functional part of that list be? We know that Cabinet Ministers, by constitutional convention, must be privy counsellors and we need spend no further time on that. It is an admirable convention, because Cabinets regularly consider matters of high national security. It is reassuring to us all that they have taken the oath. The oath, as I recall&#151;we have already been told that its origin is in the 13th<sup></sup>century&#151;certainly makes the taker wonder whether he can live up to the very high duty that he owes to Her Majesty. In addition to Cabinet Ministers, there are certain Ministers of State, who used to be referred to as those who were not in the Cabinet but of Cabinet rank. Also, certain Ministers who consistently deal with security matters are, or ought to be, privy counsellors.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09051274000042"></a>Then there is the judiciary. The reason a certain number of judges have to be privy counsellors is because of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which still serves a number of dependent territories of the United Kingdom. All members of the Appellate Committee, soon to be translated to the Supreme Court, are rightly privy counsellors; and all the members of the Court of Appeal are also privy counsellors. Not so long ago, the Court of Appeal was a rather small body and its members needed to be privy counsellors because, from time to time, they were called on to serve in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to supplement the judges of the Appellate Committee,  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1007"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1007</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who were simply not available when they were sitting on the Appellate Committee. Now that we have a Court of Appeal numbering no fewer than 38 members, one wonders whether one can say that all of them are serving a functional purpose. At least a proportion of the Court of Appeal&#146;s privy counsellors are, frankly, there for purely honorific reasons. The Court of Appeal&#146;s functional reasons in the old days have not led any Government to have a cut-off number for making privy counsellors in the Court of Appeal such that, when a judge is initially appointed to the Court of Appeal, he is not made a privy counsellor and only becomes one when it is really felt that he is needed to add to those in the functional section.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09051274000043"></a>The other category of privy counsellors applies to Back-Benchers who have had meritorious careers, not as members of the Executive but as parliamentarians. It has become the practice to make chairmen of senior Select Committees privy counsellors. This is an excellent convention. Indeed, I would like to see the day when chairmen of Select Committees had the same status as Cabinet Ministers. It would mean that the task of controlling the Executive in another place was regarded as just as important as being in the Executive. One would wish to see, in future, young people entering another place being in genuine doubt as to which of the two sorts of political career they would like to follow. If it became the well established tradition that Back-Bench Select Committee chairmen were always made privy counsellors, we would be making a good start in that direction.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09051274000044"></a>We have been told that 42 members of the Privy Council have been sworn in over the past year. I have not seen the list because I am not quite sure where to look for it; it is certainly not widely publicised. I suspect that quite an important proportion of this list is purely honorific. With great respect to the present Government, it was a mistake for them to stop the practice that was carried out throughout the 18 previous years of Conservative Government. During those years, unless you were a Cabinet Minister, you could only become a privy counsellor if you appeared in one of the two annual honours lists. I invite the noble Baroness to look back at those. She will find that all other privy counsellors&#151;excluding judicial members of the Court of Appeal, who were appointed automatically&#151;appeared in either the Queen&#146;s Birthday Honours List or the New Year&#146;s Honours List. To my almost certain recollection, there never was a time when more than three or four were appointed in each honours list.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09051274000045"></a>That seems to be an approach worth the Government&#146;s while considering. It not only contains the acceleration of privy counsellors who were made privy counsellors for purely honorific reasons, but also helps the Prime Minister when he is put under pressure to make a new privy counsellor, which we have learnt from the noble Lord the Leader of the Liberal Democrats in your Lordships&#146; House plainly happened from time to time. I suggest that it is not only the proper approach to making new political privy counsellors outside the Cabinet, but one that the Prime Minister would find extremely helpful.</p>

I came to almost precisely the same conclusion that he has come to. It ought to be rare for a judge to chair an inquiry, for both the reasons that he gave. First, we know that judges are under intense pressure in the courts, and for the Lord Chief Justice to allow a senior judge to have significant time off to conduct an important public inquiry undermines the task that Parliament has set him. The most graphic example of that is the noble and learned Lord, Lord Saville, who started his inquiry into Bloody Sunday in 1998 and is unlikely to complete it before 2010. Perhaps an even better reason for not using judges is that, inevitably, most inquiries that the Government think are of sufficient importance for a judge to chair are likely to deal with very controversial matters, thus dragging our judges even further into a political world that they have had to grow used to inhabiting since the passage of the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09051274000048"></a>I am extremely attracted to parliamentary inquiries, and I find the United States Senate an illuminating analogy. The parliamentary inquiry should be a Joint Committee with no political party having an absolute majority. In important inquiries, the parliamentary membership should be composed of privy counsellors. Those two locks to prevent party politics infecting their operations would produce results that would be more accountable to the public than those that would be achieved by judges. Parliament should not be frightened of taking that role. It is perfectly capable of devising a scheme that would ensure that the decisions made by the inquiry would not be based on party politics.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09051274000049"></a>The other matter&#151;there is no need to do more than touch on it today&#151;is the extent to which the royal prerogative, for the exercise of which privy counsellors are almost exclusively responsible, should be cut down by statute. We have already had the graphic example of the islands. Closer to home, I note that in the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill there is, it seems to me, a clear intention by the Government to substitute many of the prerogative powers in relation to the Civil Service for a statutory scheme. We do not know exactly what changes the Government will make to the draft Bill but I would be&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09051274000060"></a>The Privy Council dates back to at least the 13th century. It formerly ran the whole Government, along with the Exchequer. The Cabinet is a committee of the Privy Council, which is why all Cabinet Ministers have to be privy counsellors too. Some modern departments were originally boards of the Privy Council, such as the Board of Trade and the Board of Education.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09051274000061"></a>These days the Privy Council is simply another way of saying &#147;Ministers collectively&#148;. It is a thoroughly modern example of joined-up government which provides a highly effective means of dispatching a great deal of public business. The Privy Council approves amendments to the byelaws and statutes of chartered institutions. It also approves rules made by the statutory registration councils responsible for the medical and certain other professions, and it makes instruments of government for higher education corporations. In addition, it makes certain appointments to statutory bodies.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09051274000062"></a>The Privy Council is served by the excellent Privy Council Office, which has done a huge amount to remove the perception that the council is too secretive. There is nothing secret about it. The dates of its meetings are posted on the Buckingham Palace website, and the day after every meeting the Court Circular gives details of those who attended. The Privy Council Office is fully committed to open government and its website explains the role in great detail. It is always happy to answer questions about the council&#146;s activities. It also lists all members of the Privy Council, and I can furnish any noble Lord with a list of the recently appointed privy counsellors.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09051274000063"></a>On prerogative business, where there is no legislation allocating the responsibility to a particular Minister, the council provides a mechanism for giving ministerial advice to the Queen, as constitutionally the Queen acts only on such advice. On statutory business, where the use of &#147;the Privy Council&#148; rather than &#147;the Secretary of State&#148; in an Act enables more than one government department to be involved, it allows joined-up government. It also enables the devolved Administrations to be involved, as the First Ministers are all privy counsellors.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09051274000064"></a>There are only small areas of government business which Ministers deal with as privy counsellors. The fact is that almost all the prerogative powers formerly exercised by the Privy Council have been taken over by Parliament. The vast majority of the prerogative business done by the Privy Council is not significant enough for Parliament to want to take it over&#151;for example, the affairs of chartered bodies.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09051274000065"></a>The role of privy counsellors, and indeed of the Privy Council, is often misunderstood. The main misconception relates to the name and the council&#146;s historical role. &#147;Privy Council&#148; suggests secrecy and a body acting as a counterpart to the elected Government. As I have said, the Privy Council simply means &#147;Ministers collectively&#148;. There can be no difference between Privy Council policy and government policy, and Ministers are accountable to Parliament for all matters conducted through the Privy Council.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09051274000066"></a>Although the continued existence of the Privy Council is more or less a constitutional and historical accident, it provides a convenient mechanism for involving more than one government department in policy decisions. Its role has become more important since devolution,  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1011"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1011</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as it provides a way of ensuring that Ministers of the devolved Administrations are included in cross-border issues that fall to the Privy Council.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09051274000067"></a>The appointment of privy counsellors is made by the Queen on the recommendation of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. However, I take note of the advice from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that perhaps we should look to what happened under past Conservative Governments, because that might be of assistance to my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. This ensures that the Queen is suitably and properly advised on all matters which come before her in Council.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09051274000068"></a>In determining who should be appointed, a range of factors are taken into account. Those appointed mostly comprise Ministers, other parliamentarians and members of the judiciary. There are no senior or junior privy counsellors, so there are no privy counsellors who are more equal than others. Only current Ministers have a role in Privy Council meetings.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09051274000069"></a>New appointments are normally reserved for those who are involved in affairs of state and who have a close and confidential relationship with the Crown. In practice, this means those who have obtained high office in the executive or the judicial branches of the state, either in this country or in one of the countries of which the Queen is Head of State. It follows that most new privy counsellors are serving Ministers, judges or Commonwealth appointments.</p>

<a name="90512-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09051274000070"></a>I am glad that the noble Lord mentioned the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. There appears, these days, to be an expectation by Lords Justice of Appeal that they will be made privy counsellors. This seems to be an automatic right, but it is unlikely that they will all be required to serve on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09051274000071"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, raised interesting issues relating to the appointment of privy counsellors. A privy counsellorship is not an honour, it is an appointment, and in the case of politicians normally goes only to serving Ministers of the Crown, who are actually expected to play a part in the proceedings of the Privy Council. There are, however, exceptions where various politicians have been appointed to the Privy Council without ever having held ministerial office. In these cases, the secrecy enjoined by the privy counsellors&#146; oath is not used as an excuse for concealing information, but to enable senior members of opposition parties to be given briefings on confidential terms. Such an arrangement is entirely voluntary, and anyone not wishing to be briefed on such terms may decline the invitation. Having accepted a briefing on privy counsellor terms, however, he or she is understood to have agreed to treat it as confidential.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09051274000072"></a>Noble Lords will know that membership of the Privy Council is for life, and that as a result there are 545 living privy counsellors, most of whom are clearly not Ministers. That explains why we have rather more than the 40 of Henry VIII. The 545 play no part in the Privy Council&#146;s day-to-day business and are not summoned to Privy Council meetings. There are only two occasions when the whole of the Privy Council is  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1012"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1012</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>summoned to a meeting: on the marriage of a reigning Sovereign and, on the accession of a new Sovereign&#151;the Accession Council.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09051274000073"></a>Noble Lords will also be aware that, from time to time, a committee or other body is set up, comprising privy counsellors, usually distinguished people who either never were, or have ceased to be, Ministers. These bodies do not form part of the official Privy Council mechanism. They are not committees of the Privy Council; they are committees of privy counsellors. They do not report to the Lord President of the Council, and they are not serviced by the Privy Council Office. Examples include the Newton committee and the Butler committee, cited by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth; he raised some very interesting suggestions regarding more and better use of privy counsellors, as members of parliamentary commissions of inquiry, for example.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09051274000074"></a>I welcome such ideas and I agree that, on occasion, such commissions might well be preferable to judicial inquiries because of time constraints, although I hope noble Lords will agree that there will never be an inquiry as lengthy or as costly as the Saville inquiry. I will take these ideas back to some of my colleagues, who have considered them in the past, but they are certainly worth considering again. I am much attracted by the suggestion that Select Committee chairmen should be privy counsellors.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09051274000075"></a>The Privy Council has a number of standing committees: the universities committee, the baronetage committee and committees on the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. There are also various ad hoc committees.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09051274000076"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, referred to what he called the shameful case of the Chagos Islands. As he said, my right honourable friend Jack Straw stated in a programme this morning that, with hindsight, he should have engaged in parliamentary scrutiny to debate the issue of the Chagos Islanders. I am sure that that is the case, and while I understand the concerns expressed, it is right to stress that the Privy Council is not a sinister counterbalance to the elected Government, or a means of avoiding parliamentary scrutiny. Ministers are accountable to Parliament for all matters conducted through the Privy Council, and almost all important statutory Orders in Council are subject to parliamentary procedure.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09051274000077"></a>There are those who argue that the Privy Council is an outdated institution. I do not agree. There are those who will argue that the Privy Council is unconstitutional and that there is a lack of transparency and democratic accountability, but that is not the case. There are those who will put forward arguments that prerogative powers have no place in a modern democracy, and that is something that the Government continue to review. <I>The Governance of Britain</I> Green Paper said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_165"></a><a name="09051274000104"></a>&#147;The Government believes that in general the prerogative powers should be put onto a statutory basis and brought under stronger parliamentary scrutiny and control. The Government also intends to undertake a wider review of the remaining prerogative executive powers and will consider whether, in the longer term, all these powers should be codified or put on the statutory basis&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09051274000078"></a>The specific powers discussed in the Green Paper were deploying Armed Forces abroad; ratifying treaties; dissolving Parliament; recalling the House of Commons  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1013"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1013</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and placing the Civil Service on a statutory footing. Measures on ratifying treaties and on the Civil Service were included in the draft Constitution Renewal Bill, published last year, and the Government hope to introduce the Bill for carry-over later this Session. The Government have also published proposals for a more formalised role for Parliament in decisions for deploying troops overseas. My right honourable friend the Leader of the other place is taking forward work on those other measures.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09051274000079"></a>In conclusion, the Privy Council is one of those rather odd bits of the UK constitution, which none the less works extremely well. I am proud to be its president. If we were starting from here, we might not invent it, but, in practice, it fulfils an important role in our constitutional and government arrangements. Long may it continue.</p>

<a name="09051274000080"></a><b><a name="90512-0015.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051274000139"></a>Lord Wallace of Tankerness:</b> My Lords, the effect of this amendment would be that any order made under the Bill designating an area as a marine conservation zone, in so far as the order includes provision to restrict exploitation of fisheries resources, should not take effect until it had been agreed that the restriction would apply to vessels from all member states of the European Union.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09051274000081"></a>As your Lordships will recall, we touched on this issue in Committee. Indeed, an amendment moved by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, facilitated a debate on it, and it attracted interest from many parts of the Chamber. With regard to fishing resources beyond the six-mile limit, there is a requirement that things take place under the common fisheries policy. Therefore, any restriction or anything that interferes with or controls fishing in that area would require the agreement of the European Union before it could apply. However, the Minister indicated that of course it is possible for Ministers to put tighter restrictions on UK-registered vessels but not on other EU vessels which may well have long-standing, historic fishing rights within that area. That gives rise to the concern that it will lead to strong feelings of resentment among those who ply their trade in British fishing vessels, if they were to see their opportunities restricted where vessels from France, Spain, the Netherlands or Ireland were, in the very same waters, able to continue fishing.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09051274000082"></a>If the overall purposes of this Bill are to be effective, it is generally important that all those with an interest in the marine life of the nation are part of those who  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1014"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1014</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>subscribe to what happens under the Bill. First, if an important sector of the marine community&#151;namely, the fishing industry&#151;feels alienated by what happens under the Bill it could go a long way to undermine its effect, not just in respect of marine conservation zones but more generally. Secondly, if we do not subject other European nations&#146; vessels to the same restrictions, any conservation benefit that might accrue through restrictions on UK vessels could readily be undone by the fact that non-UK registered vessels would be able to carry on with no such restrictions. Therefore, the conservation effect would be diluted.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09051274000083"></a>It is clear that the Government share these concerns, as has been said, but also that they have no way of ensuring that consent will be given or that other member states will subscribe to agreeing to these restrictions. In a letter to me on 23 March, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, stated:</p>

<p><a name="09051274000099"></a>He went on to observe, quite fairly:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_169"></a><a name="09051274000108"></a>&#147;Yet, the commitment in Europe under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive will influence the restriction of fishing where necessary and help ensure adequate levels of protection for a network of marine protected areas. Other Member States will therefore also need to provide adequate protection for their protected areas if they are to meet their legal obligations. So there will perhaps be a mutual interest in adopting a more supportive stance towards marine nature conservation in the future&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09051274000084"></a>That is obviously a hope and an expectation; nevertheless, as the Minister himself said, there is no way in which there can be a guarantee. It would be very unfair to our fishing industry to subject it to restrictions that do not apply to other countries&#146; fishing vessels. The purpose of this amendment would almost be as a goad, as it were, to pressure the Government to ensure that they secure agreement, because that is in the interests of not only our fishermen but of conservation. I beg to move.</p>

I shall also speak to Amendments 119 and 120, both in the name of my noble friend Lord Taylor. This group of amendments refers to an issue that was labelled in Committee as the whale in the Jacuzzi. The Minister tried his best to answer our concerns but, as is so often the case where EU or international law is concerned, he was reduced in the last resort to saying, &#147;We just don&#146;t have the power&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09051274000086"></a>The amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, returns us to the uncomfortable fact that the network of marine conservation zones from six nautical miles to the outer limits will be ineffective without EU approval. Not only will any marine conservation zone outside that six-mile limit be unable to achieve its objectives, since no restrictions can be imposed on foreign fishermen that breach the fisheries agreement, but it is likely that&#151;somewhat as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, was explaining&#151;they will instead put UK vessels at a disadvantage compared to their EU colleagues. They will also have to bear a disproportionate amount of the burden of restoring our fish stocks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09051274000087"></a>The Minister and his officials, in their draft strategy which at the moment applies to waters adjacent to England and Wales, have given us a very useful update on how EU and UK negotiations are progressing. Can he tell us how many UK representatives are involved in those negotiations and how they are dealing with devolved issues? Is it a requirement that the UK should draw up the EU zones according to the rules, which I gather are laid down and well understood, and submit them for acceptance by the European Community or do we expect the Community to designate further zones? Although I cannot entirely follow the exact wording of the amendment, because of my concerns about the ineffectiveness within the offshore zones, I do not think the inshore zones should wait for the very slow wheels of the EU to turn. I would appreciate any information which the Minister can give the House about how long he expects the current situation to stand. I would particularly welcome a rough idea of how long it will take to get zones between the six and 12-nautical-mile boundaries agreed under Council Regulation 2371/2002, which we discussed in Committee.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09051274000088"></a>We also tabled Amendment 119 to probe a little further what the Minister said in Committee about the extent of sea fishing defence. I understand from the debates in <I>Hansard</I> that the defence covers only legal sea fishing and that subsection (3)(b) would kick in and disallow any use of that defence if the common fisheries policy were ever changed to allow for sea fishing outside the 12-nautical-mile limit to be restricted at a national level.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09051274000089"></a>Amendment 120 raises the concern from the Royal Yachting Association, which felt that the Government were being rather timid in their interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Its interpretation of Articles 56 and 58 would suggest that we are able to regulate all vessels, not just UK registered ones, for the purpose of conservation or preservation of the environment as long as such regulations do not impact on navigation. I hope that the Minister has looked very carefully since Committee stage at this point and will be able to respond more favourably this time.</p>

A few years ago, if my memory serves me correctly, about eight Spanish boats were based in Milford Haven and brought fish back to the port. That appeared to be a loophole in the EU regulations. I am not sure whether that still continues.</p>

I say to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, that I understand the resentment which might be felt by the fishing sector. I hope that it will have confidence in this legislation. We shall do everything that we can to ensure that it gets the relevant information. I well understand the sentiment which lies behind Amendment 110B. He is right, of course, that under the common fisheries policy we have scope to set conditions unilaterally for UK vessels.

Indeed, some noble Lords would welcome that possibility. It is true that on rare occasions we have done so and it is entirely possible that we might want to do the same to show environmental leadership and increase our chances of persuading other member states of the EU to do likewise. We will not rush into doing so, but it would not be right simply to remove that instrument as a result of the amendment. Were we to remove such an ability, it should be done in the context of reform of the Common Fisheries Policy more generally. I will come to our approach to reform of the CFP a little later in my response.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09051274000092"></a>Of course, one has to recognise, as the noble Lord did, that there are areas where only UK vessels fish within the nought-to-six-mile zone and parts of the six-to-12-mile zone. The amendment would make our ability to regulate those exclusively UK fisheries subject to agreement in Brussels. We would be very wary of limiting our national powers in this respect.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09051274000093"></a>On Amendment 119, I have acknowledged that there are concerns over the effect of Clause 137(3). It provides a defence to the general offence in Clause 136 for people engaged in sea fishing. This is, of course, an important economic activity and an important part of our maritime culture. Where people are engaged in it legitimately, they should not be penalised for the damage that it causes. When we authorise such types of fishing as beam trawling, we have to accept that a certain amount of damage will occur. It might include breaking fragile organisms, such as corals and sea fans, or uprooting plants such as sea grass. Clause 137(3) therefore acknowledges this by providing a defence for sea fishing.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09051274000094"></a>However, of course, this part of the Bill is about the conservation of the natural environment. Obviously, we want to do everything that we can to maximise the protection that we give to marine conservation zones. In this, I agree with the noble Duke that we do not want those who are fishing illegally to benefit from this defence. I make it clear that to benefit from the defence, the conditions in both limbs must be met. The second limb requires that the damage caused could reasonably have been avoided. If a fisherman is using the wrong gear and, as a result, cause greater damage than necessary, or if he is fishing in a place where certain or all types of fishing are prohibited, he will not be able to claim that the damage could not reasonably have been avoided. The damage could patently have been avoided by complying with the relevant legislation. Therefore, he would, on my understanding, be guilty of an offence under Clause 136.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09051274000095"></a>This is not a theoretical situation. Where the evidence makes a strong case for them, there will be restrictions on fishing activity. In the nought-to-six-mile zone, where the UK has greatest control, inshore fisheries and conservation authorities will put appropriate by-laws in place. Between six and 12 miles from shore, we will seek agreement for appropriate restrictions from the European Commission and those EU member states that have historic fishing rights under Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002. Beyond 12 miles, as noble Lords  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1017"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1017</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are aware, we cannot act unilaterally to regulate fishing. We must seek protection for our marine conservation zones through the Common Fisheries Policy. While securing protection through this mechanism is dependent on the agreement of other member states, which we cannot take for granted, we will, of course, do everything that we can to do that.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09051274000096"></a>On the questions raised by the noble Duke about the nature of the EU negotiations, the number of people involved and the agreed timing for zones, I do not have the information to hand. I have not been able to get hold of it during our debates and I am afraid I shall have to offer to write to the noble Duke on those matters.</p>

So certain areas will have to be zoned and the gear appropriate to those zones will have to be covered. If someone is found holding the wrong gear, that will be cause for instituting a charge against them. It is in the nature of trawling in the sea that by the time the damage is found the people who carried it out will be miles away and no one will have any idea who it was.</p>

Clearly we will want to make this process as vigorous as possible for the reasons that the noble Duke has mentioned. I hope it will not be a situation where enforcement is weak or we are unable to detect who the perpetrators are. It is our intention to have a rigorous system in place.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09051279000003"></a>We will of course use our best endeavours to seek the agreement of other member states to the measures we require. Obviously we are hopeful that we will be able to get appropriate agreement within the EU. Of course, one has to accept that the context in which we discuss these matters is the common fisheries policy. My colleague, Mr Irranca-Davies, the Minister for fisheries, has written to Commissioner Joe Borg on that matter to press the case for the reform of the common fisheries policy. Noble Lords may have seen the recent reference in the media to the commissioner&#146;s views on what I thought were deemed to be acknowledged problems and failures with the CFP as it is. I was encouraged by those remarks. Commissioner Borg has replied to my colleague to say that he shares the Government&#146;s view that the future common fisheries policy needs to take fully into account the wider integrated approach. He also wrote that the CFP needs to become an effective tool in the management of fisheries in the context of marine protection.</p>

<a name="90512-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09051279000004"></a>Clearly these are early days in the reform process, but that is an encouraging start. However, all those who have been involved in negotiations with the EU, particularly over the common fisheries policy, will know that there is a very long way to go before we have a successful outcome. None the less, we start from a more encouraging base than we have had for many a long year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09051279000005"></a>On Amendment 120, we want to provide the most effective protection we can for marine conservation. We want to be able to protect marine conservation

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09051279000006"></a>On the concerns raised by the noble Lord, Livsey, I shall take the opportunity to check and write to him further. My initial understanding of the point is that they are bound by the rules of the member state in which they are registered. I am not sure that that is a loophole but, as with other matters in relation to fishing, the noble Lord has identified one of the challenges that we have with this.</p>

If the amendment were passed into law, it would perform the important function of keeping pressure on the Government to try secure agreement. I do not think that there is any doubt that the Government recognise what the issue is and that they would like to see a proper resolution to it. It was therefore important to take an opportunity yet to remind them in case they were showing any signs of doubt. I have no doubt that, when the Bill is enacted and marine conservation zones come forward, this issue will regularly appear. As I have said, to keep the pressure on to try to secure agreement at a European level is essential not only in terms of fairness but for effective conservation. Against that background, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We had a useful discussion in Committee on two slightly different amendments, since when the Minister has kindly arranged a meeting with officials from the various departments concerned and other organisations involved. Our discussions there certainly reassured me that the issue is being taken seriously by the department&#151;I am happy to place that on record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09051279000009"></a>One basis of my previous argument was that such an amendment is necessary to enable the Government to fulfil their obligations under the European Landscape Convention.

The Minister wrote to explain his department&#146;s thinking on how the United Kingdom already complies with the convention. That  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1019"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1019</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was appreciated, but it did not go quite far enough. I understand that this is an area where thinking is developing. I also understand that both Natural England and English Heritage have plans for implementing the convention which would include historic seascapes assessment, so that the characterisation work carried out by English Heritage in Liverpool Bay and other places will not be lost.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09051279000010"></a>While I have been reassured by the fact that work and thinking on this subject are ongoing, it will nevertheless be up to us to ensure, if the amendment is not accepted, that the issue is followed up and made clear in primary legislation when a suitable vehicle is presented&#151;that will possibly be the heritage protection Bill if it ever sees the light of day.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09051279000011"></a>I have also noted the part to be played by the recently published, high-level marine objectives document, <I>Our seas&#151;a shared resource</I>, which will, I understand, inform the marine policy statement and marine planning. The document defines &#147;seascape&#148; as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_172"></a><a name="09051279000098"></a>&#147;An area of sea, coastline and land, whose character results from the actions and interactions of land with sea, by natural and/or human factors&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09051279000012"></a>As the ministerial policy statement process may be the next opportunity to deal in a suitably flexible manner with the developing thinking on seascapes, I would appreciate it if the Minister would give us comfort on four points: the recognition of the importance of seascapes; support for further work on defining what they are, and the identification of nationally important seascapes; confirmation that the marine policy statement will specifically address seascapes and include recognition that nationally important areas may be so defined in future; and confirmation that these areas will be a material consideration in the marine consenting process.</p>

I support the amendment and the spirit behind it. I ask the Minister to consider the fact that we are talking about the grounds for the designation of MCZs. If the grounds for designation can be features of geological or geomorphological interest, which are in the list, it is strange&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, explained so well when she talked about the interaction between sea and land&#151;that things other than those of geological or geomorphological interest seem to be excluded.

Those issues will be very real to people: they will concern the coast that they see, love and look at. It is critical, as the high-level objectives are worked

We had a good debate on this in Committee, where noble Lords widely accepted the concept of special areas of coast that are of exceptional beauty. We know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. My favourite maritime view, of the Wash from Shep Whites, may be too strong on the horizontal to suit all tastes.

Perhaps both are equally important. What can be accepted without argument is the need to ensure that, on land or at sea, there is a requirement to observe the context and to seek to maintain the natural beauty of place. We cannot doubt that this area will develop and become more, rather than less, important. I expect that the Minister will assure us that the planning system and the Bill seek to ensure that this will happen. I hope that he can make that clear in his reply to this important amendment.</p>

They are worried about this particular development. As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has just said, people enjoy seascapes from the sea, which implies from a boat. The boating authorities are worried that moves at this stage on seascapes might inhibit their activities, which would also rebound on those countless millions of people who go to sea for leisure activities in the course of the year in this country. This is much too broad, at this stage. I appreciate that the Government are looking at this in the longer term, but seascapes are something that we did not look at in the pre-legislative scrutiny committee and it is too early to get too involved in this at this moment in time.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, indicated, there was an interesting and wide-ranging debate in Committee on these issues, which clearly showed a range of opinions and the interest in the issue. I have borne in mind the point of the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, when he emphasised the fact that the seascape could be enjoyed by looking from the sea to the land as well as from the land to the sea. I always recall that individual who, in that most attractive of lakeside views in the north Italian lakes, admired so much a monastery on a little island in the centre of the lake that he moved from his side to the monastery when a property became available. Never again did he have as good a view as he had from the land, looking at the house that he had bought. Therefore, we have to bear in mind the question of seascapes, which has a certain subjective quality, as well as the issue of whether one is looking at them from the land or from the sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09051279000020"></a>Of course, the Government have considered the issues a great deal since Committee. I was grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, for indicating that the meeting that took place with officials advanced the cause somewhat further. There was no difference between the Government and noble Lords about the value of seascapes and the extent to which this Bill would not reach its objectives if it did not take them into account. However, our problem is the issue of definition. The Government published the high-level marine objectives on 20 April, and there are a number of references in that document to seascapes. It highlights the fact that the Government have a clear commitment on this issue. The objectives also contain a high-level definition of what might be considered a seascape, which is inevitably very wide&#151;even to the point, noble Lords may think, of vagueness. But we have all struggled with the issue of definition, and we all recognise how difficult it is.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09051279000021"></a>The definition refers to:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_173"></a><a name="09051279000099"></a>&#147;An area of sea, coastline and land, whose character results from the actions and interactions of land with sea, by natural and/or human factors&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051279000087"></a>This is the Government&#146;s commitment to seascapes. We have a working definition; I am all too well aware of the fact that my noble friend Lord Howarth seeks to participate in this debate and might be a little scathing about the limited dimension of the objective and the vagueness of the definition. We were under pressure from the committee to recognise the issue of seascapes and produce some definition, which is what we have done. I appreciate the work that the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, and my noble friend Lord Howarth have done in seeking a definition, but there is a great deal of work still to be done.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09051279000022"></a>We need to develop our understanding of the nature of seascapes. That is why, inevitably, the Government are somewhat nervous about enshrining the current position in legislation. Legislation, after all, has some degree of permanence to it and a great deal of work still needs to be done on definition. It is difficult to set out what we mean by a valued seascape and, consequently, one that deserves special protection. Our ideas are bound to evolve over time as we understand these issues more. I hope noble Lords will appreciate the extent to which the Government have wrestled with this issue and the fact that we are making some progress. I say to the noble Baroness and to all noble Lords who supported her&#151;although the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, entered his caveat&#151;that there are sufficient difficulties about this issue for us to have anxieties about how we express them in legislation.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09051279000023"></a>English Heritage is looking at the characteristics of historic landscapes in parts of the marine environment where aggregate dredging takes place, and Natural England recognises the importance of seascapes. Its landscape policies explicitly encompass seascapes and, as a statutory adviser on the natural environment, the advice it gives takes into account all relevant impacts on landscapes and seascapes. It has recognised in its action plan, the European Landscape Convention to which the noble Baroness referred in her opening remarks, the need to develop a seascape characterisation of the English coastline to help inform planning and management decisions. So work is going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09051279000024"></a>We cannot accept a definition in the Bill, but there is clear recognition in the high-level objectives&#151;which will feed into the marine policy statement and, in turn, inform the marine plans&#151;of a commitment. As the plans are drawn up under the widespread consultation mechanism we have defined clearly in the Bill, the regionally important seascapes of whatever formulation &#151;views from or towards the land, or precious coastal environments&#151;can and will be identified. Decisions on licensing and consenting developments which then follow will need to take account of these matters. This may not be a designation process, as such, because we have some problems with that concept, but nothing may be deposited or built in the sea, and so affect a seascape, without a licence to do so. So there is protection with regard to our valued perspectives.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09051279000025"></a>I want to reassure the House that we do not have to wait for marine plans to be in place for seascapes to be taken into account. We are already able to consider them through consultation on current development applications, which are handled by the department. English Heritage and Natural England advise strongly on cultural and conservation matters, and decisions are influenced accordingly. We try to obtain consensus through amending proposals where we can, and we have, for example, moved the siting of wind farms further offshore after representations. If the marine plan conflicted with local consensus on a view which should be protected, we would not automatically expect one to trump the other. Decisions will be taken on a case-by-case basis. One of the reasons for allowing &#147;relevant considerations&#148; to be taken into account by marine plan authorities such as the MMO is precisely because of the kind of issue to which the noble Baroness has given voice with her amendment.</p>

Surely the marine plan should have taken account of such things in advance and, therefore, local sensitivities about the seascape should be incorporated within the marine plan before it is adopted.</p>

We hope that that will obtain in the vast majority of cases. I am just anticipating circumstances where it is felt that the marine plan has not been sensitive enough to a local position or where the consensus has been established that what is suggested in the marine plan conflicts with other views. I am merely indicating, within that framework, that the issue of the seascape could provide an important part of the necessary discussion. The noble Lord is right: this is to reflect what we hope will be a minority of positions where the marine plan has not evolved on the basis of a sufficient consensus to have taken those factors into account and obviated the anxieties that he identified.</p>

This is a more difficult concept to wrestle with. That is why we I am seeking to identify that the Government have been persuaded of the importance of this issue. We will take these factors into account. We do not expect marine plans to evolve without consideration of this matter and we have agencies that will advance the cause, but the marine planning system is a powerful tool. It will certainly provide the protection that noble Lords are seeking through this amendment, but we cannot constrain the planners quite in the way that the amendment suggests by attempting a definition on the face of the Bill which, at the present time, still lacks a unifying consensus and raises difficult issues.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09051279000029"></a>I hope that the Government will be given credit for wrestling with the issue and making progress and that the noble Baroness will feel that that is a basis on which she can withdraw her amendment.

Like the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, I enormously welcome the serious thought and care that the Government have taken in addressing this issue. We were very grateful for the meeting that was recently held under Defra auspices with the participation of a number of other bodies such as Natural England and English Heritage. It was particularly pleasing to learn about the work that Natural England&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09051279000035"></a>Yes, we recognise that there are definitional difficulties. There are definitional difficulties in defining an area of outstanding natural beauty, but the planning system has learnt to do that. The evolution of policy legislation and marine planning practice should lead us to a

But I also recognise that a considerable amount of work is needed before we get to that point. It is good to know that the need for that work is being taken seriously by the relevant agencies.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09051279000036"></a>I was particularly appreciative of what my noble friend had to say about the marine policy statement. Developing that statement will be an evolutionary process, but when we have it, that statement will, at least for the time being, be an authoritative statement. It will be a policy that creates the context within which those responsible for the marine planning system, and decisions taken under it, will have to do their work. The assurance that the Minister has given that the high-level objectives stated in the recently published document will feed through to the marine policy statement and the indication he gave that the commitment to seascapes will be a material planning consideration give us a great deal of reassurance.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09051279000037"></a>On that basis, I am very grateful to the Minister and the department for the seriousness with which they are addressing this issue.

It is a question of getting the right balance and not forgetting that those who are enjoying the pleasures of the sea are not ruining somebody else&#146;s enjoyment of a beautiful seascape.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09051279000039"></a>I did not hear the Minister, in his remarks, specifically answer the four points that I raised about the marine policy statement, although he was able to give some new reassurance about it and about the proposed functioning of the marine planning system. I do not fully understand why a definition of &#147;seascape&#148; is so difficult, especially when there is a perfectly adequate one in the high-level objectives document I quoted. Nevertheless, I appreciate that this is a very complex area and we want to get it absolutely right. Since we are aware that work is ongoing in getting it right, I will live in hopes of another opportunity to see this enshrined in primary legislation. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I must confess that I tabled my amendment at a time when I predicted that there would be another amendment which would strengthen the requirement so that it would not just say that in designating marine conservation zones, account &#147;could be taken&#148; of the socio-economic  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1025"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1025</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issues, but that account &#147;must be&#148; taken of the socio-economic conditions. So I tabled my amendment in order to counteract that opposing tendency and to toughen up the need to take the socio-economic conditions into account, but I have been rather wrong-footed by the fact that no such amendment is now on the Marshalled List. Nevertheless, needless to say, in the spirit of soldiering on in a lost cause, I shall continue to make the point. First, I thank the Minister for all the additional information that we have had in the last few days about the designation, the draft strategy for marine protected areas, the quaintly-noted &#147;Note 1&#148; draft guidance on selection and designation of marine conservation zones and indeed the briefing note on Part 5 of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09051279000041"></a>I quote from that briefing note, because it goes some way towards reassuring me that socio-economic factors are indeed, as it says, optional, secondary considerations. It says that it is implicit that the appropriate authority must make such a decision&#151;that is, the decision to designate a particular area as a marine conservation zone&#151;based primarily on scientific evidence; it would not otherwise be exercising its duty in a reasonable way. It goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_175"></a><a name="09051279000101"></a>&#147;We believe this underlying scientific foundation is the correct approach ... The consideration of social and economic factors should be an option open to the appropriate authority and not a compulsory part of the process&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051279000089"></a>I suppose that the least that I might get tonight is for the Minister to say that he does indeed endorse his own briefing note, and have that in <I>Hansard</I> for perpetuity as opposed to on a piece of paper that has been circulated to us and which nobody will remember existed in a year&#146;s time. I thank the Minister for those statements in the guidance. I hope he will endorse it and that the briefing note is indeed right.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09051279000042"></a>I should briefly state why I would prefer it if the socio-economic requirement were stated in a completely different way; that is, that it was not possible to reduce the power of the scientific evidence that ought to underpin marine conservation zones by tempering it in the initial stages with socio-economic issues. The evidence is exactly as I stated in Committee and at Second Reading. We have been struggling for 25 years to get protected areas in the marine environment but we have hardly any at all. We have three small sites, mainly because every other site that was ever raised fell foul of socio-economic pressures.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09051279000043"></a>There are other mechanisms in the Bill and assurances from the Government about the pace of creating a network and the need to create an ecologically coherent network, and other issues that we will discuss under other amendments. In a way, perhaps the Government have nowhere to hide on this. We cannot face another 25 years of socio-economic conditions getting in the way of the designation of marine conservation zones, or at least I hope so.</p>

<a name="90512-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09051279000044"></a>On several successive occasions I have raised another argument about the fact that socio-economic conditions should not be taken into account in the initial designation. It has not been an impediment with the terrestrial environment, where socio-economic conditions have not been taken into account in European legislation on protected areas under the European Natura 2000

They are designated entirely on the basis of the intrinsic merits of their importance to nature conservation, which is how it should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09051279000045"></a>Anyway, having now made the same points for the third time, in a Groundhog Day sort of way, I will give up because I know that I have no general support from other Benches. Nevertheless, before I sit down and ask the Minister to endorse his own briefing note, I will comment on Amendment 113ZA, which is grouped with my amendment. I look forward to hearing the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, in this amendment. I must admit that I was a bit bemused by his definition of &#147;science&#148;, which included &#147;opinions&#148;. Not being a scientist myself, I could not definitively say that science cannot include opinions; but I suspect that if other noble Lords who were steeped in science were in the Chamber, they may well think that &#147;opinions&#148; is perhaps pushing the boundary of science slightly too far.</p>

The Minister will no doubt say that it is a developing area and that the noble Baroness quoted from one set of guidance. I have the draft guidance on the selection and designation of marine conservation zones. Paragraph 5.14 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_176"></a><a name="09051279000102"></a>&#147;Where areas contain features which are rare, threatened or declining, or form biodiversity hotspots, ecological considerations are likely to carry greater weight in considering the area&#146;s suitability for designation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051279000090"></a>Given all those features&#151;&#147;rare, threatened or declining&#148;&#151;the ecological considerations should carry greater weight. I feel that this Achilles heel still exists and might damage the very concept of marine conservation zones. I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for enabling us to have this discussion and for giving the Minister an opportunity to say where the Government sit on this issue.</p>

That debate was lengthy and represented a wide variety of views. The Minister responded at length about the balance the Government were trying to find between conservation bodies, seeking the complete acceptance of their recommendations, and groups representing social and economic interest, which were concerned that zones would be designated without any regard for their impact on other legitimate users of the sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09051279000049"></a>As a result of those debates, I find that I cannot agree with the amendment of the noble Baroness but that does not devalue the amendment and the discussion we are having because of it. We have always held that designation of zones will be meaningless if they cannot be implemented and enforced properly. The proper consideration of the pressures that will be placed on them and the genuine attempts to relieve those pressures without damaging their conservation objectives will be essential if the part is to work.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09051279000050"></a>The Government&#146;s own document, which we have recently received, points out that we should not belittle how much is already covered: 9 per cent of the inland coastal waters and 2 per cent of the continental shelf are covered under mature conservation regimes. It shows that in embryo there is already a strong conservation movement in marine conservation, from which I imagine much has been learnt about the efficacy of MCZ designation.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09051279000051"></a>We have tabled Amendment 112, which seeks to ensure that the appropriate authority seeks the advice of the body that will be making the decisions that will result in the achievement of the zone&#146;s objectives. The drafting is rather clumsy because the appropriate authority is the national body of the multi-nation United Kingdom. It is clumsy owing to the difficulties of the devolution aspects of the Bill, but essentially the amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State will consult the MMO before designating a zone in the area.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09051279000052"></a>My noble friend Lord Kingsland has tabled an amendment to which I have added my name, which would further require the appropriate authority to base his decision to designate zones on scientific evidence. He will no doubt speak to his amendment in detail; I look forward to listening to what he has to say.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09051279000053"></a>However, I should like to add that much of the debate on this controversial subsection (7) results from the belief by one set of stakeholders that the Secretary of State will come under unfair pressure from another set and that he will be tempted to make unfair decisions on the basis of money or political expediency. Therefore, I strongly support my noble friend&#146;s efforts to ensure that the decision is made on science, just as we succeeded in ensuring in Clause 2, and I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the two Conservative amendments in this group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09051279000055"></a>I presume that the Government are able to include Clause 114(7) in the Bill only because European Community law in the context of MCZs is not as demanding as in the case of land-based SLAs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09051279000056"></a>I turn to my own amendment, which would add a further subsection to Clause 114 as follows:</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09051279000057"></a>I am puzzled that, whereas the Government felt it appropriate to include a similar&#151;indeed, an identically&#151;worded provision in Clause 2, laying down the general objective to be pursued by the MMO, they nevertheless, for reasons which I am anxious to hear, did not feel it necessary to have the same reference to scientific evidence for the appropriate authority making decisions under Clause 114.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09051279000058"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young, raised a question about the word &#147;opinions&#148; in my amendment. This matter was referred to in our debate on Clause 2 at this stage of the Bill. For my part, I found the Minister&#146;s explanation as to why &#147;opinions&#148; was appropriate entirely satisfactory. He may well wish to repeat what he said at that stage of the Bill or explain it in a different way. However, scientific evidence can give rise to different opinions about its implications; and that is the framework in which the word appears in the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_280"></a>
<a name="09051279000059"></a><b><a name="90512-0017.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051279000139"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords, I wanted to delay speaking on this group until I had heard the speeches on the two Conservative amendments so that I could understand the reasoning behind them. Having heard them, it seems to me that Amendment 113ZA in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, while probably not strictly necessary under the sort of argument that the Government usually use&#151;that it is covered anyway&#151;nevertheless would be useful because it would, in particular, underline the conservation basis of marine conservation zones, as opposed to their social and economic aspects. For that reason, if no other, I think it would be a useful amendment.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09051279000060"></a>I do not quite understand the purpose of Amendment 112, from the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach. Already, under Clause 116, there are substantial requirements for consultation and public advertisement on proposals for MCZs. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment seems to refer specifically to organisations or bodies which have had functions delegated to them by the MMO, and not to others. I am not sure what the justification for that was. He may say that, earlier and under a different context, I said that local authorities should have a special status in consultation, but I explained that that was because local authorities are very different organisations from others, being democratically elected, representative bodies. It seems inconceivable that bodies that had delegated functions in relation to MCZs would not be consulted about their designation.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09051279000061"></a>I suspect, although it is normal for opposition parties generally to want more in Bills rather than less, that the Government are trying to be minimalist about what is in it. Nevertheless, I am not sure why the Conservative amendment is necessary.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="09051279000062"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone is important and substantive. She said there was not general support here, but I think the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said that there was lots of sympathy&#151;or perhaps it was the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland; it was. That is true, and the noble Baroness will ask what the use of tea and sympathy is when she wants noble Lords to join her in the Lobbies.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="09051279000063"></a>There is a great deal to be said for the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment in relation to some marine conservation zones. We were not able to persuade the Government that there should be high-level marine conservation zones, where activities other than those related to conservation were effectively banned, as was proposed by my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, but in relation to those particular zones the noble Baroness is 100 per cent right. Under those circumstances, social and economic factors are irrelevant. It has to be based on the facts on the ground, or under the sea, and on the science.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09051279000064"></a>We hope that lots of marine conservation zones will be set up. I suppose I should not refer to the bottom of the scale, especially in relation to the sea; however, as you go along the spectrum, there will be MCZs that increasingly depend on fewer important aspects, in relation to that site, where there is a choice.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09051279000065"></a>I have said how grateful I was, and have praised these documents which we have had recently. Note one of the draft guidance on selection and designation, which people have poked fun at, is a very important document, but I do not think it is yet 100 per cent right. Indeed, it is a draft for discussion and consultation, and it is right that that should happen. In Section 4, the principles for design of the marine protected area network are important, because one of the important principles, and the first listed, is representation. It may be&#151;it almost certainly will&#151;that some of the areas where it will be necessary to declare MCZs for representative reasons are areas where, in the real world, there will be a choice between different sites. In the highly protected ones, however we describe them, there will not be, but in many there will. Where there is a choice, it is unrealistic to say that social and economic factors should not come into the equation in making the decision.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09051279000066"></a>On the other hand, the draft guidance, in section 5, sets out the principles for the identification and selection of MCZs, and it sounds pretty high-level. It talks about:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_178"></a><a name="09051279000104"></a>&#147;The range of marine biodiversity ... Rare or threatened habitats ... Globally or regionally significant areas for geographically restricted habitats or species ... Important aggregations or communities of marine species&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09051279000092"></a>and so forth. Reading this, there is no sense of the kind of gradation or hierarchy which the Government talked about previously. I am not sure that the document has completely got to grips with that. The part of it that comes under the heading &#147;Taking account of social and economic factors in site selection&#148; contains a lot of on-the-one-hand/on-the-other-hand type of arguments. However, I do not think that it has really got to grips with the factors that will result in the decision being made. For example, referring to what we would call high-level sites, it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_179"></a><a name="09051279000105"></a>&#147;The existence of socio-economic interests will not preclude consideration of an area for designation of an MCZ, nor compromise the setting of appropriate conservation objectives&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051279000093"></a>I do not think that you can have both of those. It says that such interests will not preclude consideration of an area, but they will not compromise the setting of appropriate conservation objectives. There are going to be compromises, not in what we would call the high-level

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="09051279000067"></a>I will not read out any more of this section because I would be detaining the House, but paragraphs 5.13, 5.14 and 5.15 provide an interesting and important discussion of the issues we are trying to grapple with here. However, I do not think that it is the end of the road; I think that it is the beginning of getting to grips with those issues.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="09051279000068"></a>So I would like to support the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone. I cannot support it as it stands, but I very much support it in relation to the high-end, high-level MCZs, however we describe them, that we hope to see established. The compromises and the way in which the choices will be made on those which are not high level and are being chosen particularly because they are representative is one of the fundamental, interesting questions here.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="09051279000069"></a>The final comment I make is in referring back to a discussion we had in Committee when I was debating with the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham. I was saying that when the 1949 Act was passed, there was a clear vision for national parks, and the pattern and system that we would have, based on the Hobhouse reports and the wide-ranging public consensus that existed. I was complaining that the Government did not have that sort of vision when it came to marine conservation zones. Well, I think that the documents that the Government are producing are evidence of the fact that they are beginning to develop a kind of vision of the system and network they want. I do not believe that they, or we, are there yet, but I believe that the work is now taking place. I think that if that continues to take place, with the kind of commitment set out in these documents, we might well get there.</p>

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves; I know that there have been concerns, at various stages of debating its different aspects, that the language of the Bill does not, perhaps, reflect our vision. We dealt with that on our first day on Report, particularly in the debates on Clause 2. I acknowledge what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said about the documents that we produce, which he thinks are an emerging vision. Clearly, a lot of that is work in progress and many of those are draft documents. I hope that they are, indeed, helping to convince stakeholders that the Government are serious, which we are about taking this forward when it comes to MCZs. We see the contribution of MCZs as being very important to the health of our marine environment.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="09051279000071"></a>Amendment 112, on the designation process, requires &#147;the appropriate authority&#148; to &#147;consult any public body&#148;. We believe that is covered by Clause 116(4), which sets out that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_180"></a><a name="09051279000106"></a>&#147;The appropriate authority must consult any persons ... likely to be interested in, or affected by, the making of&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09051279000094"></a>an order. Any public body exercising a marine plan function will clearly have an interest in a site designation, as it affects the marine plan and must be factored into planning. I hope that I can reassure the noble Lord on that point.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1031"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1031</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90512-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="09051279000072"></a>I turn to Amendment 113ZA, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Taylor, which seeks to strengthen the reference to science and, most importantly, scientific evidence in the designation of marine conservation zones. Science is clearly important in determining where we will designate sites. Clause 114(1) ensures that scientific criteria form the basis of site proposals, setting out specific grounds for designating marine conservation zones, including the number and diversity of,</p>
<ul><a name="09051279000111"></a>&#147;marine flora or fauna ... marine habitats ... and features of geological or geomorphologic interest&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051279000095"></a>I want to make it clear that Clause 114 has been drafted so that science must, by necessity, form the basis of site proposals. I am certain that the number or diversity of marine fauna and flora could not be determined without scientific advice; I have had categorical advice on that point. I do not believe, then, that Clause 114 needs to include a specific reference to science.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="09051279000073"></a>However, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has invited me to come to his support on the use of &#147;opinion&#148;&#151;and I feel that I must, because we debated this on our first day on Report and, as I said then, the use of &#147;opinion&#148; is not deemed to be any old opinion. It is simply a reflection that, on many scientific matters, there will be varying opinions, all of which may very well be valid and need to be considered. Although I do not agree with the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, the use of &#147;opinion&#148; is entirely acceptable.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="09051279000074"></a>We then come to Amendment 110D, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Young. She said, at the beginning, that she proposed this anticipating another amendment that she thought might come, seeking to strengthen subsection (7). Although that has not come, it reflects a continuing debate about the balance to be drawn around MCZs between conservation needs and relevant socio-economic interests. That balance runs through many parts of the Bill. We are all trying to get the balance right.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="09051279000075"></a>I thought the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, was absolutely right: while it is perfectly possible to disagree with the noble Baroness, the debate is very important. I reassure the noble Baroness that the fundamental basis for designating marine conservation zones will be the science supporting conservation. The Bill allows us to factor in the impacts of designation on other interests at a slightly earlier stage in the process. It ensures that we have a flexible system which gives us the best chance of delivering conservation policies in the context of our wider marine policies. We wish to provide significant protection for some areas of our seas.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="09051279000076"></a>I have just set out how the drafting of Clause 114 specifically requires marine conservation zones to be proposed based on scientific evidence, and science will clearly be important in decisions regarding the designation of the network. The science will be the first consideration in all designations. In some cases the need for conservation must prevail but, at the very least, we should take decisions in the knowledge of the likely impacts. That is why, in implementing the Bill, Ministers will expect an impact assessment to accompany each proposal for designation.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="09051279000077"></a>In some cases we will have more options. In designating a representative site, for example, we will often have more choice of potential locations and we will need to  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1032"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column 1032</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consider the size and shape of a marine conservation zone. In such circumstances, it would be sensible to take account of socio-economic considerations in deciding where a site, or group of sites, should be designated. Such considerations will be relevant. We are establishing regional and national project groups, involving interested parties to make recommendations on proposed sites. We also want all those with an interest to feed in their views. That will ensure that we take account of all the relevant considerations when designating sites and setting their conservation objectives.</p>

<a name="90512-0017.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="09051279000078"></a>The noble Baroness invited me to endorse my own briefing note on Part 5. I have given agonising consideration to that matter and I am glad to confirm that I endorse it. It is implicit that the appropriate authority must make such a decision based primarily on scientific evidence; otherwise, it would not be exercising its duty in a reasonable way. Social and economic factors are optional secondary considerations. I believe that that is reflected in the drafting of the Bill. I hope that noble Lords will accept that we have reached a very sensible balanced outcome.</p>

However, given his statement, I recognise that were there to be any doubts raised about that, and were litigation to be ensued, the statements that the Minister has made in your Lordships&#146; House this evening would clearly be admissible under the doctrine of Pepper and Hart. I am comforted by that reflection.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000003"></a><I>Relevant Document: 8th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.</I></p>

<p><a name="09051236000004"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09051236000116"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> This is a revised code of practice that deals with the powers of examining officers currently in use at air and sea ports in the United Kingdom, along with international rail services. The draft before the Committee relates to the Terrorism Act 2000 (Code of Practice for Examining Officers) (Revision) Order 2009, which is designed to bring into operation the revised code of practice for examining officers that was laid before the House on 26 February and which would replace the original code that was brought into operation on 19 February 2001. The powers will continue to operate under the original code should we fail to agree the revised code.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000005"></a>The code of practice covers powers contained in Schedules 7 and 8 to the Act, which allow examining officers at the locations that I mentioned to stop, question and detain persons. This examination is for ascertaining whether the person is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000006"></a>Schedule 14(5) to the Act requires officers to perform functions conferred on them in accordance with any relevant code of practice. There is also a requirement under the Act for the Secretary of State to issue the relevant code of practice. An &#147;examining officer&#148; is defined as a constable, immigration officer or customs  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC334"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>officer. However, it remains the intention that immigration or customs officers will use these powers only under very specific and exceptional circumstances in support of the police service, as detailed in the revised code of practice.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000007"></a>Given the importance of the legislation that this code supports and the changing terrorist threats that we have to face, we must ensure that the advice that we give to officers performing this difficult function remains comprehensive and pertinent. Therefore, the code of practice aims to provide clear guidance to ensure that the powers are used proportionately and without discrimination, thus meeting the high standards that we expect of the police service.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000008"></a>We recently refreshed CONTEST, the cross-government counterterrorism strategy, which highlights the international nature of the threat that we must tackle. The powers covered by this code of practice are essential to ensuring that those who seek to harm the interests of the UK are unable to travel through our borders unhindered. The information gathered supports us in bringing to justice individuals involved in terrorist activity and allows the public to go about their lives freely and with confidence.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000009"></a>As part of his annual review into the operation of the Terrorism Act 2000, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, reports on the operation of Schedule 7. Given his great knowledge of this topic, the noble Lord provided significant advice regarding the revision of this code, and his assistance is greatly appreciated.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000010"></a>The Act requires a period of formal consultation as part of the process of issuing a code of practice, which we undertook during 2007 and 2008. In addition to seeking the opinions of the public in general, we specifically invited a range of community groups that may be affected by these powers to comment. I am grateful to those organisations and individuals who responded to the consultation.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000011"></a>A number of concerns were raised during the consultation and, in addition to technical issues, a key matter of interest for the community groups was the subjectivity of selection of individuals for examination under these powers. To address these concerns, the revised code provides guidance on the factors to be used when selecting individuals for examination so that it is clear that it is unacceptable to target any specific community.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000012"></a>The police service, supported by the Home Office, will continue to monitor and address the concerns of communities to ensure that we continue to strive to minimise the inconvenience to those not involved in terrorism while maintaining a strong defence against those who seek to harm our society. I commend the revised code to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000013"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051236000117"></a>Baroness Neville-Jones:</b> I thank the Minister for explaining the statutory instrument and its purpose. As he said, the code of practice for examining<I></I>officers was first issued in 2001 and it is right that it has been consulted on and reviewed in the light of the experience of practitioners and to reflect changes in technology and other pieces of terrorism legislation. I echo the Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments in commending the practice of review and improvement  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC335"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to produce a practicable guide. The procedure has been excellent. I also welcome the Minister&#146;s remarks on comprehensiveness, relevance and proportionality in implementation.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000014"></a>The Minister outlined in detail the specific changes made to the code of practice. I will not touch on them all, but I seek clarification on five points. First, the code makes it clear that neither examination nor detention of an individual, nor a combination of examination and detention, should exceed nine hours. How was this figure of nine hours arrived at? If, during that period, the officer concludes that nothing terrorism-related was found in relation to the foreign national being examined, is the presumption that he or she will then be admitted?</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000015"></a>Secondly, from the report of the statutory reviewer of terrorism legislation, it is clear that the operation of the Terrorism Act 2000 and the implementation of the related powers should be only for terrorism-related purposes, not for other purposes, otherwise their credibility and community relations will be damaged. As the Minister mentioned, the Government have now added guidance notes to the code to help examining officers to decide when to exercise their powers. These notes say that the examining officers should base their decisions on a number of considerations, including known and suspected sources of terrorism, information on the origins and locations of terrorist groups, current or emerging terrorist activity, local trends and patterns of travel known to be linked to terrorist activity, and so on.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000016"></a>I freely acknowledge that this is sensible guidance, but will the Minister say how the examining officers will come to have knowledge of these factors and how they will test them when examining an individual, all within nine hours? Some police forces have little experience of and expertise in terrorism, so will they be briefed regularly by the security services, the regional counterterrorism units or some other body? Will the Minister assure us that the different agencies and organisations will share the necessary intelligence with those tasked to be examining officers? In other words, is the system adequately joined up?</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000017"></a>I know that, in relation to the Prevent strand of the CONTEST strategy, Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Audit Commission have raised concerns about the lack of systems and procedures to allow information sharing between the security services, the local police forces and local authorities. So my question is not idle. It is important to have some assurance that the guidance that has been put in place will be implemented in a context that enables it to have real effect.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000018"></a>Thirdly, the code of practice states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051236000099"></a>&#147;an examining officer may seize and retain for examination anything produced during an examination or found during a search for a period of up to seven days&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09051236000096"></a>beginning with the day on which the detention commences. The code goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051236000100"></a>&#147;If anything is found which in the opinion of the examining officer may be needed for use in criminal proceedings or ... in connection with a decision ... to make a deportation order ... it may be detained for as long as is necessary&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC336"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC336</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09051236000097"></a>The key question is: what is &#147;necessary&#148;? In these circumstances, under what obligation is the examining officer to inform and keep up to date the person to whom the property belongs? Are they kept in the loop?</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000019"></a>Fourthly, the code of practice states that an examining officer may,</p>
<ul><a name="09051236000102"></a>&#147;authorise another person to carry out a search on his behalf&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051236000098"></a>The subsequent guidance note says that only examining officers who have been trained to exercise search functions should carry out searches. Can the noble Lord confirm, therefore, that only a constable, immigration officer or customs officer trained as an examining officer may conduct a search?</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000020"></a>Fifthly, will the Minister clarify two points about the collection of fingerprint samples, which do not seem to be entirely clear from the revised code? When can fingerprints be taken? Can they be taken only once a person is detained or, if they have given their consent, can the applicant&#146;s fingerprints be taken before they are informed that they are being detained? Will the Minister clarify the purpose of taking fingerprints? This is an important point. Is it only to confirm a person&#146;s identity or can the fingerprints be used for other purposes?</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000021"></a>There is obviously a wider point about how the state retains and uses fingerprint samples. This is my last point, but one to which I attach a good deal of importance. There has rightly been a great deal of argument about the retention and use of DNA samples, which implicate about 1 million people who have not been convicted of anything. We on these Benches are extremely uneasy about this situation and have put forward proposals to remedy what we regard as an unwarranted approach. We do not want a replication in other fields with other forms of identification. What is the Government&#146;s position on the retention and use of fingerprint samples taken in these circumstances? The samples of innocent people should not be held indefinitely, particularly as examining officers at ports of entry can examine and even detain a person, regardless of whether or not they suspect that that person is, or has been, concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism. In other words, there is no distinct standard for a reasoned basis for a fingerprint sample being taken.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000022"></a>During the public consultation, which the Minister mentioned, I know that a number of concerns were raised about how to ensure the objectivity of examining officers when they decide whether to use the powers available to them. In the report that I mentioned, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said of examination at ports of entry:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051236000101"></a>&#147;In the past I have suggested repeatedly that the number of random or intuitive stops could be reduced considerably. From my discussions with counter-terrorism police officers I know that considerable attention is being focused by the police ... on behavioural analysis and the better use of intelligence&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000023"></a>That observation is positive and very good news, but it clearly needs to have practical effect and implementation. Will the Minister update the Committee on the follow-up to those observations? I am sure that we do not want a situation akin to that which we have   


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC337"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>seen with Section 44 of the Terrorism Act, where people are suspicious about the use of stop-and-search powers and whether they are being used inconsistently or for reasons that are entirely unrelated to those for which the powers were put on the statute book. How many people have been stopped under Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act by examining officers in the past two years? How many of these have led to terrorism-related charges?</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000024"></a>Being able to stop and examine an individual without reasonable suspicion is certainly a wider power than is normally available to the police, immigration officers or customs officers. As I have said, we do not want a situation to arise where the powers of examining officers are used inconsistently or for reasons not entirely related to those for which the powers were put on the statute book. We must be conscious of the risk of this, particularly given that powers that have been much more tightly defined have attracted criticism for that very reason. These Benches will be extremely grateful for an update on the implementation of the recommendations of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile.</p>
<h5><a name="09051236000106"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09051236000025"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051236000118"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> From these Benches we welcome the update of the code. However, it would have been useful&#151;no doubt the Minister will tell me whether this was procedurally possible&#151;for this to have been an amendment to the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Bill. Obviously, it has only just come to the Government, but did they consider that route? The revised code could have been debated in context, especially the issue of training, which is a key to the implementation of the code. On 28 April, the order was debated in the other place. Referring to training, the Minister said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051236000103"></a>&#147;this is difficult. It is not easy&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Third Delegated Legislation Committee, 28/4/09; col. 13.]</ul>
<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000026"></a>The noble Lord will remember that these Benches put down amendments to the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Bill to explore training much more fully. That would have enabled discussion about a combined police force, its merits and so on. Effectively, this order represents that effort to further streamline the way in which various officials work and, in this case, take on extra powers of the police. When the other place debates that Bill, it will have the benefit of looking at the debates in its own Committee and in our House and will no doubt reflect on some of the points that were made.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000027"></a>The code has profited much from the scrutiny of my noble friend Lord Carlile of Berriew. As he has underlined throughout his report, it is critical to be fair and to be seen to be fair. That is the key. I know that the Minister is concerned with this. He has made the point before that in the context of the counterterrorism plan, CONTEST, the Government have referred to the necessity to be as open as possible so that certain groups do not feel unfairly singled out. Being as open and transparent as possible feeds through to how well we can scrutinise the implementation of the code, a matter to which I shall return in my concluding remarks on statistics.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC338"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000028"></a>I know that the Conservative Front-Benchers share our concern that Section 44 of the Terrorism Act should be given the same scrutiny and treatment that we are giving to this code. I must say to the Minister how disappointed we are that the Home Office will not even say where the designated areas are in which you can be stopped and searched under that Act. I gather that that information is simply unavailable, even when applied for under the Freedom of Information Act, so it is hard for the public to know when they have been stopped reasonably under the PACE code and when they have been stopped unreasonably under the Terrorism Act. That is not good practice. Perhaps we could take a leaf out of the book of the New York police authority. It may not always be in the forefront of good practice, but it has just introduced a new code, &#147;Stop, Frisk and Explain&#148;, and is retraining its officers in the absolute importance of explanation. When the PACE code was drawn up, the feeling was that it should be very clear why someone was being stopped.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000029"></a>We welcome the move towards a much more targeted and less random approach. The Government suggest that there will be less room for intuitive stops. I recognise that these are difficult questions, but will the Minister say what part intuition will be able to play now and what proof we have had that it is ineffectual? Intelligence-led action is bound to reflect intuition, so the new code needs to be clear about exactly the part that intuition can play and when it is reasonable. That comes back to the training particularly of senior staff, because it is a difficult balance.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000030"></a>We are pleased that the code will cover the relevance of the questions asked of the people who are stopped. It is extremely important that people are asked relevant questions, not irrelevant ones. However, we are disappointed to note that the numbers of local stops at different airports and ports are not collated centrally. This brings me back to my point that it is difficult for us, and for senior management and Ministers, to judge on the basis of the statistical evidence just how well the code is operating. Do we know how many people overall have been stopped and how many of those stops and examinations have led to arrests, deportations or refused entries? Perhaps the Minister will tell me that those statistics are available, but I have not been able to find them. I gather that the rate of stops and examinations is in the order of 1,200 per annum, but is that figure going up or down? It is essential to know these figures. Surely the local stops can simply be fed into a spreadsheet that adds up the total number of examinations. This is not rocket science, so I am surprised that it is not done.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000031"></a>We certainly share the worries expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, about the fingerprints of innocent people being retained. When those fingerprints are taken and retained, what conventions now govern sending them off to other countries, for example? What agreements do we have to do that, or is it never done? If it is done, in what circumstances is it done?</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000032"></a>Overall, we welcome the updating of the code; it is certainly a move in the right direction. However, in order to have a really good idea of how it is operating, some of these basic questions about numbers need to be answered, as do the more ephemeral ones about the role of intuition.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC339"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC339</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09051236000033"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051236000119"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> I thank those who have contributed to the debate. The powers that the code supports are significant but the points that have been discussed demonstrate just how important it is that we provide adequate advice to those who carry out this vital role. We have gone a lot further with what we have done now than was the case beforehand. The revised guidance seeks to reflect not only the changes to the terrorist threat since the original code was introduced in 2001 but all the feedback that I talked about that we have received during the consultation process.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000034"></a>I shall reply to some of the many questions that I have been asked. The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, asked about the nine hours. This was set out in the Terrorism Act 2000. It was regarded at that time as acceptable to both Houses and was felt to be an appropriate period. I think that it was slightly subjective. After nine hours the examining officer must decide what action to take&#151;either to allow the person to pass through to immigration controls or to take other action as appropriate.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000035"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Neville-Jones and Lady Miller, touched on the briefing of officers. Counterterrorism officers are all trained on a specialist training course. This was raised during the BCI Bill and I absolutely accept the fact that training is very important. They are trained on a specialist training course accredited by the National Police Improvement Agency. In addition, officers are not only linked directly to the security services, but there is a national facility to co-ordinate the dissemination of intelligence to ports officers. The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, is absolutely right: historically, the linkage&#151;how joined up this has been&#151;has not been that clever. I think that we are getting better at it now, but certainly I remember visiting Gatwick 18 months ago and being slightly shocked by how poor the linkage was. We put in hand various things to make sure that linkage is there so that officers have the data that they require to give them the information to conduct investigations and to see where they should be focusing, so that their investigations are primarily intelligence-based on a whole raft of issues that feed into that intelligence.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000036"></a>The police examining officers are generally from the Special Branch, and their main focus is counterterrorism, so they are immersed in this intelligence area. They are always dealing with security and intelligence agencies and, as I say, I think that we have dramatically improved the sharing of information. However, we always have to be extremely careful with this because, as we have debated a number of times on the Floor of the House, when one has these sorts of data, how they are passed backwards and forwards and who has access to them is extremely important. It is extremely dangerous not to handle them very carefully indeed. We have put in hand safety measures to ensure that they are looked after properly and cannot be accessed by the people whom we would not wish to access them.</p>

The fingerprints may be retained and used only for terrorism investigation, the prevention or detection of a crime, investigation or prosecution. I think that, post the Marper case, the retention period will probably be about 12 years for samples taken from the person detained under Schedule 7.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000038"></a>Examining officers are able to conduct searches under the code. At present, this is undertaken only by police examining officers. However, an examining officer can empower another person to conduct the search on his behalf. I am not sure exactly what the criteria are that that person has to fulfil; I shall get back in writing on that. I am assuming that we are talking about those other two types of officer, but it might be broader and I shall get back on that point. If I have not covered all the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, I hope that she will get back to me, as I shall get back in writing on the others.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000039"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, touched on the difficult balance to be struck in both applying these powers to defend our borders and treating individuals fairly. It is a difficult issue, as I know from my travels around the UK. I was in Edinburgh recently, where a number of Sikhs feel that they are being targeted unfairly. I am sure that the noble Baroness has come across a number of cases, too. After talking with various groups, we have tried hard to ensure in the guidance that officers have to use the broad range of information available.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000040"></a>On the question put by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, I go back to the point that these are counterterrorism officers, who are looped in on the intelligence side. They normally do these things on an intelligence basis. She mentioned the sources, origins and travel patterns of terrorist groups. We talk about intuition, but the distance between intelligence and intuition is sometimes not that great, as officers are so immersed in this area. However, the work is intelligence-based and evidence-based. The new code of practice&#151;</p>

I was in the midst of answering the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about subjectivity. We talked about the training of officers and the fact that they were Special Branch and immersed in this intelligence area; we also talked about intuition. We have to be careful in codifying not to write out and remove all those things, while giving clear indications of what people should base their reason on for stopping someone to ask questions.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000042"></a>The new code of practice makes it absolutely clear that a person&#146;s perceived ethnic background or religion must not be used alone or in combination as the sole reason for selecting a person for examination. We have also made that absolutely clear to people in training,   


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC341"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because we are aware of the perception, although it is probably a bit more than a perception. We must get this right. There cannot be a stronger indication that the targeting of individuals based on the community of which they are part is completely unacceptable. That was certainly our aim.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000043"></a>On why this was not in the borders Bill, the code primarily relates to police use of Schedule 7 and is essentially part of the Terrorism Act 2000. It cannot be used for other purposes. It would therefore not be appropriate to try to cover it in more general borders legislation. That is why we did not include it there.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000044"></a>On reducing invitations to stop, work is continuing to provide police with the skills and tools to target the use of these powers. We are working with them on how they can use the information collected from e-Borders to target the powers more effectively; that will be very helpful. We are looking at the experience of other countries and the techniques that they use to identify people whom they think are suspicious. The noble Baroness talked about the New York police and what they have achieved.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000045"></a>Both noble Baronesses mentioned statistics. We  do not collect all statistics. Nationally, about 11,500 examinations under Schedule 7 in excess of one hour occurred between the introduction of the powers in 2001 and December 2008. In comparison, published statistics regarding the use of stop and search under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act for the  period from April 2001 to March 2007 show that 205,000 stops occurred, so the former is a dramatically smaller number.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000046"></a>We do not collect all the more detailed statistics that both noble Baronesses referred to. We should consider whether we should collect some other statistics to see what we can achieve. I am very interested in the Section 44 powers and am asking how and when they have led to something. It is difficult to extract that information, but if the power is not getting what we want, is it worth the aggravation that it causes? One needs to look at that jolly closely. I would like to have the evidence to be able to assess that; at the moment, I do not. I have been prodding to try to ensure that I get it. As soon as one can get such information, it should be disclosed and people should be aware of it. We should be working to try to achieve that.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000047"></a>I said that I would write to the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, about examining officers&#146; authorisation of others. I now have an answer from my team. It states that, although the Act allows examining officers to authorise any person, in practice this would apply only to individuals with specialist training. An example would be a need to examine in detail a vessel where, for safety reasons, a trained maritime engineer is the only person who can carry out the function, as directed by an examining officer. Under normal circumstances, the search would be carried out by the examining officer himself. That is the basis of that provision.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000048"></a>I hope that that answers the bulk of the questions. If I have missed any, I ask the noble Baronesses to please get back to me and I shall try to answer them. On that basis, I commend the Motion.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000049"></a>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Transfer of Tribunal Functions (Lands Tribunal and Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2009.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000050"></a><I>Relevant Document: </I><I>11</I><I>th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.</I></p>

<p><a name="09051236000051"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051236000122"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> The order abolishes the Lands Tribunal and transfers its entire jurisdiction into the Upper Tribunal of the new tribunals system created by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act, which received Royal Assent in July 2007. It forms part of our commitment to provide a  truly modern, unified and independent tribunals system.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000052"></a>The Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act is the culmination of many years of hard work to reform this country&#146;s tribunals system, set in motion by Sir Andrew Leggatt in his review, <I>Tribunals </I><I>For Users</I><I>: One System, One Service</I>. It provided for the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal, creating a unified appeal structure. On 3 November 2008, three first-tier chambers commenced work&#151;the Social Entitlement Chamber, the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber and the War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation Chamber. The Administrative Appeals Chamber of the Upper Tribunal was also established.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000053"></a>This order provides for the Lands Tribunal jurisdiction to be transferred into the Upper Tribunal. We set out in our consultation a three-chamber structure for the Upper Tribunal, proposing to recreate the Lands Tribunal substantially unchanged as the Lands Chamber of the Upper Tribunal. Our intention was to preserve and enhance the special qualities of the Lands Tribunal within the new structure, with priority given to continuity. Responses to the consultation showed strong support for this approach. Alongside this transfer of the Lands Tribunal jurisdiction into the new system, a new Lands Chamber of the Upper Tribunal will be established from 1 June 2009. That will be achieved by a separate order, subject to the negative procedure, to amend the existing chambers order to establish and assign functions to the Lands Chamber. This reflects our intention that that chamber should deal exclusively with the existing jurisdiction of the Lands Tribunal.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000054"></a>Each chamber under the Act is required to have a chamber president, whose role is the maintenance and improvement of the chamber&#146;s expertise. The Upper Tribunal Lands Chamber will have a chamber president selected by the Judicial Appointments Commission. The order also provides for the transfer of existing Lands Tribunal judges and members into the new   


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC343"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>system as judges and members of the Upper Tribunal. It is essential for ensuring a good service that specialist expertise is protected and improved and that continuity is maintained.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000055"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051236000123"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I thank my noble friend; I shall be brief. This is a weighty, impersonal, complicated and rather lengthy order and I wonder whether at this point he can tell the Committee what sort of people will be on the tribunal. I heard him mention judges. Are they always going to be legal professionals or will there be ordinary people? What sort of person is on the tribunal?</p>

<p><a name="09051236000056"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051236000124"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> I thank my noble friend for the question. The order provides for the transfer of existing Lands Tribunal judges and members as judges and members of the Upper Tribunal. As I said, this is essential for continuity. The Senior President of Tribunals has produced a practice statement on the composition of the Upper Tribunal hearing cases in the Lands Chamber. It sets out that those hearing land cases must be either a judge of the Upper Tribunal who has been assigned by the Senior President of Tribunals to the Lands Chamber or other members with surveyor qualifications as set out in the qualifications order. These measures will ensure that those sitting on the tribunal have the relevant expertise to hear land cases.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000057"></a>As I mentioned, the order provides for the transfer of existing tribunal judges and members into the new system. The present surveyor members of the Lands Tribunal will be transferred into the new chamber. Circuit judges or other Upper Tribunal judges with the necessary expertise will also be able to hear cases. Under the provisions of the Act, judges and members can be invited to sit in another jurisdiction, but that will happen only if the individual has the necessary qualification, is acceptable to the chamber president, has undertaken any necessary training and there is a business need.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000058"></a>Rules for the new tribunals structure can be made by the Tribunal Procedure Committee, which was created under the Act. Rules are in place for each of the chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal that have already come into effect. For the jurisdictions that have already transferred into the new system, these new rules have replaced the rules that applied in the previous tribunals. However, unlike the approach taken in previous orders under the Act, the approach of this order is to retain the existing Lands Tribunal rules, amending them to the extent necessary to bring them into line with the new tribunals structure. This will enable the existing rules to apply to the Lands Chamber of the Upper Tribunal at commencement. This approach has the support of the Senior President of Tribunals. It is an interim measure and the aim is to have rules made by the Tribunal Procedure Committee to apply to the Lands Chamber in due course. This will be achieved through the Tribunal Procedure Committee making further rules, on which there will be consultation later this year.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000059"></a>We are also making provision for the current fee structure for Lands Tribunal work to apply to appeals in the new chamber once the transfer takes effect. This is being done in a separate order, subject to the negative procedure. The approach that we have adopted means that stakeholders and users of the Lands Tribunal will see little change to procedure when the transfer takes place. While it will not be the formal title, the Lands Tribunal name will be retained for the time being in order to ensure continuity. We have not therefore conducted a separate consultation on this transfer, although we have kept stakeholders and users informed of progress via correspondence and the internet.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000060"></a>The Transfer of Tribunal Functions (Lands Tribunal and Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2009 effects the transfer of the Lands Tribunal into the Upper Tribunal established under Section 3 of the Act. Transitional provisions in the order ensure that cases currently heard by the Lands Tribunal will not be adversely affected by the transfer. A hearing that has commenced but not completed will be completed in the Upper Tribunal comprising the same members. Directions and orders made prior to this order coming into force will continue in force as if they were directions or orders of the Upper Tribunal. In addition, the order contains various minor, consequential and transitional provisions in respect of the transfers.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000061"></a>Article 2 effects the transfer of the functions of the Lands Tribunal to the Upper Tribunal and abolishes the Lands Tribunal. Article 3 provides for members  of the Lands Tribunal to be transferred to hold offices in the Upper Tribunal. Where the original office has not been abolished, the office holders will hold both the new and the old office. Articles 4 and 5 provide for consequential amendments to primary and secondary legislation and church measures. These are mainly set out in Schedules 1 to 3. However, Article 5 also makes global changes to references to the Lands Tribunal in local and private Acts and in a certain type of local order relating to transport. The order also provides for minor amendments that do not relate to the transfer of the Lands Tribunal. These amend legislation as a consequence of the earlier transfers or in relation to the implementation of other provisions of the 2007 Act.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000062"></a>The Government are committed to ongoing transformation of our tribunals, placing the user at the very heart of the service. The new system will have greater flexibility in absorbing new work or responding to fluctuations. The order, which I commend to the Committee, is another significant step towards achieving that. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000063"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051236000125"></a>Lord Henley:</b> As my honourable friend Henry Bellingham made clear in another place, we do not believe that the order is controversial, unlike&#151;dare I say it?&#151;some other aspects of the new tribunals system, but we are grateful that the Government saw reason on those matters, particularly in relation to the war pensions tribunal, and amended the whole new tribunals system. We are also grateful that the Lands Tribunal jurisdiction will be transferred to the Upper Tribunal&#151;the upper tier&#151;which we think is more appropriate. I have  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC345"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC345</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>anecdotal evidence of that. Over lunch, I sat next to a Member of this House who was also my pupil master 30 years ago. He appeared frequently in those days in front of the Lands Tribunal and, when I told him of this order, his first and only question was which tier the tribunal would be in. He was grateful that it was to be in the upper tier, which he thought was appropriate. I think that we all agree on that.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000064"></a>My honourable friend Henry Bellingham asked a number of questions in the other place, to most of which the Minister in the Commons gave a perfectly satisfactory reply. I have only one more question to add. If I heard the Minister correctly, he said that the name would remain the Lands Tribunal for the moment but might change later when there had been consultation. Does the tribunal need to change its name? I see exactly why the Government want to leave it as it is at the moment, as keeping the name might prevent any confusion as we move from the Lands Tribunal to the new arrangements. However, might it not be better to leave the name in place for longer than that? Having put that point to the Minister, I should say that we welcome the order and have no further objections to it.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000065"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09051236000126"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Henley, referred to the war pensions appeal tribunal being transferred eventually to the tribunals system. We supported the setting up of a separate chamber, but this is a slightly different situation. The Lands Tribunal is to be transported lock, stock and barrel to the Upper Tribunal, which I thought to be an appellate jurisdiction. There is provision in the Act for appeals from the Upper Tribunal to the Court of Appeal, but only on a point of law in restricted circumstances. Consequently, I was interested to note that on page 43 of the order there is a significant amendment to the rules on permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal and review. It is quite clear from this amendment to the rules that leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal is required and that an application for leave to appeal must identify the alleged error or errors of law in the decision and state the result that the person making the application receives.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000066"></a>There is further provision in the amendment to the rules proposed in the order for the Upper Tribunal to review the decision that it has already made, so in effect it reviews its own decision. I should like an assurance from the Government on this. Should not applicants to the Lands Tribunal have a wider route to appeal than that? I think that there should have been an opportunity to appeal a Lands Tribunal decision on the merits of the case and not simply on a point of law. The distinction is important because, in a review of the merits, the Court of Appeal could overturn a decision of the Lands Tribunal; if it is merely a question of a point of law, an applicant needs to establish that the earlier decision is unlawful by reason either of case law or of some other statutory provision. Subject to that assurance from the Government, we will give this order a fair wind when it eventually comes before the whole House. If the Minister has no answer to my question at the moment, I would be grateful to hear from him in writing in due course.</p>

I think that people are aware of them, but I am currently chair of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, which has an oversight role in these matters. In view of some of the Minister&#146;s references, I should say that I have served in that capacity as a member of the Tribunal Procedure Committee and have therefore played my own part, although someone else has done most of the work, in creating the new rules.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000068"></a>Tempting though it would be, in the light of what has been said from the two Front Benches, to re-enter into the arguments about war pensions, I regard them as sensibly put to sleep and do not propose to awaken them. I simply express my general support for the proposals in the order, because of the support that I and the council that I chair have for the overall process of tribunal reform.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000069"></a>I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, but my view is that, in view of the nature of the work of the Lands Tribunal, as well as the reputation that it has established, the appropriate place for it is as part of the Upper Tribunal. If I may say so to my noble friend, it could well become appropriate to consider its title when other tribunals in the land and property area come into the tribunals service, if they do in due course. That is something else on which the Minister will no doubt want to comment in general. I simply express my strong support for the order.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000070"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09051236000128"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> I thank all noble Lords for their support for the order. Even the pupil master of the noble Lord, Lord Henley, supports it, which is very useful. With regard to a name change, it is not necessary for the name to change but in due course it would be preferable for it to be clear that the Lands Chamber was part of the new tribunals system in the same way as other chambers of the Upper Tribunal. That is the situation at the moment, but we will consult before any change.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000071"></a>On the more detailed questions about the Lands Tribunal and the issue of appeal, as I understand it, the Act provides for a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal on a point of law from a decision of the Upper Tribunal, of which the Lands Chamber will form part, but only with permission from the Upper Tribunal or the Court of Appeal. An appeal from the Lands Tribunal is also on a point of law only, as I said. As Lands Chamber cases are not heard in the First-tier Tribunal, the restrictions on appeals set out in Section 13(6) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act will not apply. I hope that I have fully answered the noble Lord&#146;s question. If he wishes me to pursue it further, I am happy to get a letter out to him.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000074"></a>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Freedom of Information (Time for Compliance with Request) Regulations 2009.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000075"></a><I>Relevant Document: </I><I>11</I><I>th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.</I></p>

<p><a name="09051236000076"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09051236000132"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> The purpose of these draft regulations is to allow certain schools and pupil referral units in Northern Ireland more time to respond to freedom of information requests to take account of closure during school holidays.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000077"></a>The Freedom of Information Act enshrined in law for the first time the right of access to official information. The Act applies to over 100,000 public authorities. Since the Act came into force on 1 January 2005, central government-monitored bodies have received more than 30,000 requests each year and requests to public authorities in the wider public sector exceed 87,000 per year.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000078"></a>Under the Act, freedom of information requests must be responded to &#147;promptly&#148; and normally within 20 working days. It is right that people making requests should receive a timely response. Eighty-two per cent of requests received by central government-monitored bodies during the period January 2005 to December 2008 were answered within 20 days.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000079"></a>However, there are limited occasions when that deadline is impractical. That is why, in the lead-up to the introduction of the Act during 2004, regulations were laid to extend the deadline for answering requests for specific public authorities in certain limited circumstances. Those 2004 regulations extended the usual 20-working-day limit in relation to: maintained schools in England and Wales and schools maintained by the Secretary of State for Defence, to take account of closure during school holidays; archives, to deal with requests for information contained in a public record that has been transferred in a closed file because one of the freedom of information exemptions applies; requests where information needs to be obtained from front-line units of the Armed Forces and they cannot   


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC348"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC348</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be reached for operational reasons; and requests involving information that is held outside the UK and will take some time to retrieve.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000080"></a>The regulations would give certain Northern Ireland schools and units the same reasonable allowance that schools in England and Wales already have under the 2004 regulations. Currently, controlled schools, voluntary schools, grant-maintained integrated schools and pupil referral units in Northern Ireland can face difficulties in answering requests received during holiday periods when schools are closed and unstaffed. That is a particular issue during summer holidays, which can last about eight weeks and therefore longer than the 20 working days permitted for a response. These schools and units in Northern Ireland may, therefore, be put in a position where they will unavoidably be unable to comply with the time limits provided for under the Act. That is simply not sensible.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000081"></a>Section 10 of the Act requires public authorities to deal with freedom of information requests &#147;promptly&#148; and in any event within 20 working days of receipt. If the regulations are approved, managers of certain Northern Ireland schools and pupil referral units would not have to count any day that is not a school day, such as during the school holidays, towards the period of 20 working days within which requests must be answered. However, requests must be answered within a maximum of 60 working days in total, including any school holiday periods.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000082"></a>Schools will still have an obligation to respond to requests promptly. Where it is possible for a school to respond to a request earlier, the response cannot be delayed until the end of the extended time limit. The regulations will ensure that certain schools and units in Northern Ireland will have more time to deal with information requests when they need it most. It will also place schools in Northern Ireland on a comparable footing with their counterparts in England and Wales. I therefore commend the regulations to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000084"></a>I say no more about that, because we do not object to the regulations in any sense. However, they give me the opportunity to put two questions to the Minister. First, when the Minister in another place dealt with the regulations, he said that&#151;the noble Lord repeated the figures&#151;the vast majority of requests were dealt with in a timely manner. The figure cited in another place was that 82 per cent were dealt with within the time limit, which means, if my maths are right, that 18 per cent were not dealt with within the time limit. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister could remind the Committee what sanctions are available to encourage public bodies and all others who are obliged to respond within the 20 days to meet that target and what  further action the Government will be taking to improve their performance.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000085"></a>My second question concerns what further changes the Government might be considering. In response to that question, the Minister in another place said that they were consulting on that and expected to give the result of that consultation shortly. Can the noble Lord say anything more at this stage? In particular, what is meant by &#147;shortly&#148;? I recall that some years ago my noble friend Lord Newton of Braintree, who was here earlier, announced that we would produce something &#147;later in the spring&#148;. We had to somewhat stretch the meaning of &#147;spring&#148; when we published our response in July. Whenever a government Minister or department uses the word &#147;shortly&#148;, one feels that it is worth asking what they mean by it and when they hope to report.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000086"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051236000134"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> It may be that the 18 per cent failure rate for complying within 20 days relates to the House authorities&#146; refusal to comply with the expenses request under the Freedom of Information Act. We welcome and will support these regulations, as they bring Northern Ireland into line with England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000087"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051236000135"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I thank my noble friend for his patient introduction. Does he not agree that 60 working days is a lengthy period? Can he give us the likely reasons for requiring such a long time? The first line of the third paragraph of the Explanatory Note contains the word &#147;certain&#148;. What kind of &#147;certain&#148; authorities are we considering here, because the word has been inserted with deliberation. Likewise, we have reference to the word &#147;promptly&#148;; that seems to sit uneasily with 60 working days, which can be some months if one includes vacation days. Has my noble friend any statistics on this? Do we know how many requests are expected? Are any statistics available for previous years to inform the estimate in that respect? The Explanatory Note refers to a &#147;fees notice&#148; given to the applicant. Do the fees vary and do they always apply? May we have an instance of the kind of fee that is charged? Are they set on a nationwide basis or are they decided by a particular authority? Does my noble friend have any Welsh details to report in this respect? Also, would he define the phrase &#147;grant-maintained integrated school&#148; as it is written here and say what is meant by a &#147;voluntary school&#148;?</p>

<p><a name="09051236000088"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051236000136"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> I thank noble Lords for their questions, which I shall attempt to address; if I do not pick up every one that has been asked, I will come back in writing. On timeliness, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, is absolutely right to say that 82 per cent of requests were dealt with in time, which obviously leaves 18 per cent that were not. Some of those will be accounted for by the fact that they had exemptions, while some will have been the subject of the issues that I outlined about getting access to appropriate data and people in good time. We believe that 82 per cent is a very good response, but we should not be complacent. We have a number of activities in hand in terms of training and enforcement measures to continue to improve performance. As I have said, we have seen  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC350"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considerable improvements between the very first year and last year. The Information Commissioner can ultimately issue a practice recommendation against an organisation that continues to respond late, which I think addresses one of the issues raised by the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000089"></a>With respect to the question about 60 days being a long time, a number of organisations have the ability to have an exemption under this provision. As I mentioned, maintained schools and maintained nursery schools in England and Wales, as well as schools maintained by the Secretary of State for Defence, do not have to count any day that is not a school day, such as school holidays, towards the period of 20 working days within which the request must be answered, provided that the request is answered within 60 working days. I completely agree with the noble Lord that that seems a long time, but an eight-week summer holiday would account for 40 days of that time. If someone asked a question on the very first day of the holiday and the school was closed for 40 days, it would have only 20 working days in which to respond to the freedom of information request. Therefore, the measure probably accommodates all eventualities.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000090"></a>As regards other organisations, the National Archives, the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland and the places of deposit appointed under Section 4(1) of the Public Records Act 1958 have up to 30 working days to respond to a request when the information requested is contained in a transferred public records environment.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000091"></a>The Information Commissioner can exercise discretion to extend the 20-working-day deadline up to 60 working days in cases where, to respond to a request, information needs to be obtained from an individual who is actively involved in an operation of the Armed Forces or preparations for such an operation. The commissioner can also exercise discretion to extend the 20-working-day deadline up to 60 working days in cases where, to respond to a request, information needs to be obtained from outside the UK. I noted that the noble Lord used the word &#147;promptly&#148;. We expect people not to wait until the very last day of the extension to reply but to reply as soon as they can and as promptly as possible.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000092"></a>I have several definitions of grant-maintained, integrated, controlled and voluntary schools. It might be easier if I wrote to the noble Lord with that extensive list.</p>

<p><a name="09051236000093"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051236000137"></a>Lord Jones:</b> Thank you very much.</p>

I think that he said that the regulations are useful and that he is pleased to see them in place.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051236000095"></a>With that in mind, I reiterate that the Freedom of Information (Time for Compliance with Request) Regulations 2009 apply to specific types of schools and pupil referral units in Northern Ireland to  address specific circumstances where it is impractical to comply with 20 working days. They will not apply

I therefore hope that noble Lords will agree that this is a necessary, common-sense measure.</p>

<p><a name="09051254000001"></a>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Housing (Replacement of Terminated Tenancies) (Successor Landlords) (England) Order 2009.</p>

<p><a name="09051254000002"></a><I>Relevant Document: </I><I>11</I><I>th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.</I></p>

<p><a name="09051254000003"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09051254000044"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> We are today considering the draft Housing (Replacement of Terminated Tenancies) (Successor Landlords) (England) Order 2009, which is intended to extend the provisions in the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 that deal with tolerated trespassers so that they apply to situations where there has been a change of landlord.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000004"></a>&#147;Tolerated trespasser&#148;, as noble Lords will remember from the debate on the Housing and Regeneration Bill, is a term that the courts have coined to describe people who have lost their legal status as a tenant after the court has granted the landlord a possession order but whom either the landlord or the court is allowing to remain in the property. This will usually be on certain conditions, such as that the occupant continues to pay the current rent plus a weekly sum towards arrears of rent. In the vast majority of cases, these are people in social housing.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000005"></a>The loss of tenancy status causes serious problems not just for the ex-tenant but for their former landlord. This is because neither can rely on the terms of the tenancy agreement, which no longer applies, or on the provisions in the relevant housing legislation. I will return to what that means in practice.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000006"></a>Schedule 11 to the Housing and Regeneration Act prevents the creation of further tolerated trespassers in the future. It also remedies the position for the vast majority of existing tolerated trespassers. We debated this at some length and it commanded the full support of all parties. Part 1 of Schedule 11 ensures that in future, where a person is subject to a possession order, they will continue to be a tenant until they are finally evicted from the property. Part 2 restores tenancy status to existing tolerated trespassers. This applies to all ex-tenants who remain in their homes, with one exception, which we are dealing with today. The exception  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC352"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC352</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relates to occupants whose landlord changed after they lost their tenancy status. It is this gap that the draft order seeks to fill.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000007"></a>Perhaps I may put this in context. It is a complex issue and I am blessed with a very straightforward speaking note, thanks to official advice. By far the most usual situation in which there is a change of landlord is where the property transfers from a local authority to a registered social landlord&#151;an RSL housing association&#151;which usually happens as a result of large-scale voluntary transfers. It could also happen where one RSL takes over the stock of another or where one local authority is substituted for another, for example as a result of boundary changes, although these are likely to be rare.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000008"></a>Noble Lords will remember that at Report stage of the Housing and Regeneration Bill the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who is not in her place, introduced an amendment that would have dealt with the stock transfer situation by providing transferring tolerated trespassers with an assured tenancy. However, instead of dealing with the transfer issue in the Act, as she proposed, it was decided to add a power to provide by order for the provisions relating to existing tolerated trespassers in Part 2 of Schedule 11 to be extended to the stock transfer situation, after seeking landlords&#146; views on this issue. That is why we are debating this order. It was agreed that it would not be appropriate to make these significant changes without first taking into account the views of those landlords who would be affected by them. Since then, we have consulted on options for using the order-making power. The outcome of the consultation was unanimously in favour of amending the legislation to restore tenancy status to those ex-tenants whose landlord has changed.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000009"></a>It might be helpful to consider what happens to occupants when local authority stock is taken over by an RSL following a large-scale voluntary transfer. Existing tenants, who as local authority tenants will normally have a secure tenancy, will have a new assured tenancy under the new RSL. This is because RSLs cannot grant secure tenancies. However, the position with occupants who have lost their tenancy status before they transfer is not as clear. It is likely that practice varies from one RSL to another. The fortunate ones will be offered a new full assured tenancy, putting them in the same position as transferring tenants. Alternatively, the RSL might decide to give them only an assured shorthold tenancy, probably on the understanding that it will turn into a full assured tenancy if the person continues to comply with the conditions in the possession order.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000010"></a>However, it has been confirmed to us as a result of the consultation exercise that, sadly, some RSLs fail to offer any form of tenancy to some, or in some cases all, of the occupants who transfer to them as tolerated trespassers. This may depend on the level of rent arrears or the seriousness of the breach that led to the possession order. We estimate that as many as 70,000 to 85,000 local authority tenants could have lost their tenancy as a result of a possession order and have then been transferred to an RSL in a stock transfer situation. We do not know how many of these have not been given a new tenancy by the RSL and, therefore, continue  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC353"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC353</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as tolerated trespassers. However, we think that the number could be quite considerable. Where there has been no change of landlord, it is not uncommon for people who have lost their tenancy following a possession order to continue living in their homes for years without realising that they are no longer tenants. This is one of the grey areas of this type of situation. The issue may come to light only when they seek to enforce their tenancy rights.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000011"></a>I will cite a couple of imaginary cases which I think will help noble Lords to understand the situation.  Mrs Green has been subject to a possession order since 2001, but by and large has continued to keep up with the repayment terms in the order. She realises that she is no longer a tenant of the local authority only when she tries to get the council to do something about the rampant mould and damp in the kitchen and bathroom and the council points out that it no longer has any statutory or contractual duty towards her. A second example is Mrs White, whose true situation comes to light only when she dies and her daughter, who has always lived with her mother and has cared for her, finds that she cannot continue to live in her home after her mother&#146;s death because she cannot succeed to the tenancy under the normal rules, as technically her mother no longer had a tenancy. This would obviously be very difficult for the tenants in question to deal with.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000012"></a>The situation is different where there is a change of landlord. In another example, if Mr Gray and his wife are not already aware that they lost their status as tenants after the council took out a possession order against them, they are likely to realise that something is amiss when, following transfer of their home to Trumpton Housing Association, their neighbours are signed up to a new tenancy but they are not. Ex-local authority tenants who transfer to a new RSL are more likely to become aware of their altered status. However, the practical effect of being a tolerated trespasser will be just the same whether they are aware of it or not.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000013"></a>Why does it matter that an occupant has lost their status as a tenant? The examples that I have given illustrate that, for ex-tenants, probably the most serious consequences are that neither their spouse nor their children will be able to succeed to the property on their death and that the landlord is under no contractual obligation to repair or maintain the property. For the landlord, the picture is more mixed. We can probably see potential benefits in the existing situation, such as the absence of the repair obligation, although it seems doubtful that landlords would allow their properties to fall into serious disrepair whatever the status of the occupant. Transfer landlords have the advantage of being able to choose whether to provide tenancy&#151;and, if so, what sort of tenancy&#151;to occupants who transfer as tolerated trespassers.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000014"></a>There are disadvantages, too. It is unclear whether landlords can charge annual increases in rent from people who are not tenants or whether such people should be allowed to vote in tenant management ballots. Those who responded to the consultation exercise generally felt that the disadvantages to landlords  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC354"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC354</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of allowing the existing uncertainty to continue outweighed any theoretical potential advantages. That is the context of the order.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000015"></a>The order restores tenancy status to ex-tenants whose landlord has changed by creating a new tenancy between the transfer landlord and the occupant. The tenancy will start immediately and automatically on the date on which the order comes into force. There will be no legal requirement on the landlord to issue a formal tenancy agreement, as the new tenancy will arise automatically on the commencement date. However, to ensure that tenants are informed, we will issue guidance to landlords to the effect that they should issue former tolerated trespassers with a document as soon as possible after commencement of the order. This document will serve the dual purpose of notifying the person that they have a new tenancy and confirming the terms of the new tenancy.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000016"></a>Our aim has been to provide wherever possible that the new tenancy created by the order is of the same type as, or as near an equivalent as possible to, the original tenancy. This is in line with the provisions in Part 2 of Schedule 11. However, where there has been a change of landlord, and particularly where the nature of that landlord has changed, we recognise that this may not always be possible. In the case of a stock transfer, a tolerated trespasser who was formerly a local authority secure or introductory tenant under the Housing Act 1985 cannot continue with his previous tenancy type but must become an assured tenant of the RSL under the Housing Act 1988. This is because of the mutually exclusive provisions on landlords of secure and assured tenancies in the two Acts.</p>

<p><a name="09051254000017"></a>While the other forms of transfer&#151;that is, between local authorities or between RSLs&#151;are likely to be rare, as I have said, we have provided for these in the order as well. For example, where the original and the new landlord are both local authorities, the new tenancy will be the same as the original tenancy, in all but one case, which is where the original was an introductory tenancy but the new local authority landlord does not operate such a regime. In that case, the new tenancy will be a secure tenancy. The draft order also provides for the terms and conditions of the new tenancy to be the same as the original one, subject to any modifications that may be needed to reflect the fact that, in the stock transfer situation, the two tenancy types are different.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000018"></a>Our aim in drafting the order has been to ensure that it does not disadvantage landlords or tenants. For example, it has been drafted to ensure that no new statutory succession rights will be created. However, there is nothing to prevent a successor landlord from voluntarily offering new succession rights as a term of the tenancy agreement if they wish to do so.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000019"></a>We are giving the courts a power to allow claims to be brought between the newly restored tenant and either the original landlord or the newly restored transfer landlord relating to the period when the occupant was a tolerated trespasser. In so doing, the order aims to reproduce as far as possible the provisions in Schedule 11 that give the court discretion over whether  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC355"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC355</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to allow such claims. The provisions in Schedule 11 are in turn designed to continue the discretion that the courts currently have to allow such claims.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000020"></a>I should make it clear that the order will apply only to occupants who are still tolerated trespassers on the date when the order comes into force. Where the transfer landlord has taken action to deal with the situation before the commencement date, whether by issuing a new tenancy or by proceeding to eviction, the order will have no effect.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000021"></a>Should noble Lords approve the order, both it and Schedule 11 will be brought into force at the same time. Noble Lords should know that we have delayed the commencement of Schedule 11 because, due to the complexities of this area of law, which have been self-evident in the way in which I have had to describe the order itself, it was felt essential to make all changes at the same time for the sake of all concerned: landlords, tenants, their advisers and the courts. The Secretary of State will be commencing Schedule 11 for England and Wales. The Welsh Assembly Government are working in parallel to introduce an affirmative order in the same terms as the one that we are considering today. If all goes according to plan, the Welsh order will also come into force on the same date as Schedule 11.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000022"></a>Noble Lords may be reassured to know that, as I have mentioned, it is our intention to provide non-statutory guidance to assist landlords in implementing the tolerated trespasser provisions in the 2008 Act and the affirmative order. We will ensure that that is available as soon as possible after the provisions come into force.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000023"></a>For those of us who survived the Housing and Regeneration Bill, it is good that we are now at a point where we are putting into law the commitments that we made to make life better for people who are very vulnerable by making this secure for them. I hope that noble Lords will feel able to support the order. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09051254000024"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09051254000045"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I welcome the order. As the Minister said, it closes a loophole that perhaps should never have existed in the first place, a point that should be put on the record. This was known about; indeed, it was raised in debate and an amendment was tabled to the Housing and Regeneration Bill&#151;I was not a Member of your Lordships&#146; House at that point, but I have read the record in <I>Hansard&#151;</I>so the problem was presented to the ministerial team and the Government, and they were aware of it. There was also case law to back that up; the notes point to the Court of Appeal conclusion in the Knowsley v White case about tolerated trespassers. So there is a body of evidence pointing to the dangers for the tenant in relation to the ability to succeed to the tenancy in the event of the death of that tenant, the problems faced by the landlord in relation to being able to secure rent increases that he may legitimately be entitled to, and whether this group of people would be able to have their full rights associated with assured tenancies during the period.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000025"></a>I shall put a few questions to the Minister, who as usual has done a fantastic job of making this fairly complex legislation understandable to the non-legal minds here. I particularly appreciated the examples  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC356"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and case studies, which help to make these points clear. My first question relates to tolerated trespassers. Would tolerated trespassers be able to vote in stock transfer and tenant management ballots? Secondly, would these people actually know that they were tolerated trespassers? The Minister referred to some 75,000 to 80,000 people who may fall into this category. According to the record when this was debated in the other place, that figure was obtained in 2006, I think. Does she have a more up-to-date record of how many are covered by this provision? What steps are being taken to make sure that those who may be affected by it actually know of their rights and status? It seems that a number of these problems arise when there is a transfer from a registered social landlord. Perhaps some guidance towards best practice could be produced&#151;not necessarily in legislation&#151;setting out the process of consultation and how to ensure that people fully understand their rights and status.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000026"></a>While this may be outside the bounds of ministerial responsibility and perhaps within the remit of the courts, the term &#147;tolerated trespasser&#148; seems a bit aggressive in this modern age. Is there an alternative? It has some strange connotations and could lead people to become anxious. If I was described under law as a tolerated trespasser, that would not exactly make me feel secure; in fact, I would feel that I was doing something illegal and wrong. Language is important and I wonder whether the Minister will comment on whether the term could be changed.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000027"></a>My final point relates to the consultation. The Minister said that extensive consultation had taken place. Could she outline the nature of that consultation and the feedback that has been received? I know that some organisations, particularly Shelter, have been energetic in putting forward their concerns on this issue. It would be good to know that such organisations, where these issues are fully understood, were involved in the consultation process and that their views were taken into account. With those questions and reservations, I certainly wish to support the order, which seeks to tighten this loophole.</p>

<p><a name="09051254000028"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09051254000046"></a>Baroness Maddock:</b> I thank the Minister for explaining as succinctly as she could this rather complicated situation. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Bates, has just said, the name &#147;tolerated trespasser&#148; is extremely odd. He also mentioned the House of Lords judgment on Knowsley Housing Trust v White. What was interesting was that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Neuberger, referred at the time to the tolerated trespasser status as being &#147;conceptually peculiar, even oxymoronic&#148;. It certainly is very strange. In a way it illustrates the muddle that we have got into in housing over tenancies and the loss of tenancy status. This has been made much more complicated by the number of stock transfers that have taken place over recent years.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000029"></a>As has been said, my noble friend Lady Hamwee, who is working on another Bill today and cannot be here, raised this issue at the Report stage of the Housing and Regeneration Bill. At the time, the Government said that they would prefer to bring in the change through an order, giving time for consultation. Obviously, one cannot object to consultation but, like the noble Lord, Lord Bates, I think that it would be  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC357"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC357</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>interesting to hear a little more about what people said in the consultation. Clearly, there is consensus that this is a good idea.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000030"></a>Over the years, ideas about tenancies and who runs public housing have led us to the situation that we find in the order. I do not know, but I would not mind betting that at some time, someone, even before my noble friend, pointed out the difficulties that stock transfer could lead to in relation to what we now call tolerated trespassers. As a member of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, I have become aware that a great deal of extra bureaucracy is created&#151;especially through unintended consequences&#151;because not enough care is taken in primary legislation. I took the trouble to look back at the notes of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee when the order came through. They stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051254000039"></a>&#147;The problems caused by the legal consequences&#151;or in some cases by uncertainty as to the consequences&#151;where ex-tenants continue to live in their homes, have been an unintended result of the protection of tenants under the 1985 and 1988 Acts&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051254000037"></a>It is important that, when primary legislation is being drawn up, there is extra vigilance to try where possible to avoid unintended consequences, because that is why we are here today.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000031"></a>As I said, the order remedies problems for both tenants and landlords. It is almost universally welcomed. Let us hope that there will be no more unintended consequences. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about the consultation and to reading the guidance, some of which may also come through the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09051254000032"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051254000047"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am grateful for the welcome for the order. I will answer such questions as I can and, on those that I cannot, I will write to the noble Lord. He asked, first, whether tolerated trespassers can vote. No, not in a stock transfer ballot; no, not while they are tolerated trespassers. If the order grants them tenancy status, should there be another stock transfer they will certainly be able to vote. He also asked how they know that they are tolerated trespassers. That is part of the problem. Many do not know until an incident such as I described occurs, which makes it clear that they have no rights. They have drifted into a state of limbo with no one informing them. They have gone on paying their rent and have been able to stay in their home and the agreement has been concluded with the landlord without them understanding or being told that there has been a change of status. That is an unfortunate situation.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000033"></a>The numbers that were true up to 2007 are probably still broadly accurate. The range of tolerated trespassers as a whole, including the band of trespassers who come into our framework because the landlord has changed, is in the region of 250,000 or 300,000. We have no reason on the evidence to think that that has increased very much; I think that that is certainly true of the smaller group within that number.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000034"></a>On the language, I agree with noble Lords that &#147;tolerated trespasser&#148; is an unfortunate and aggressive term. It has been coined by the courts and has a negative connotation. The noble Baroness is right to point out the oxymoronic quality. I can say only that it is a commonly understood term, although the way in  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC358"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which I have described it does not make it sound as if it is. But it is common currency. However, when we make this change, I hope that we will not come across it again with any frequency.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000035"></a>Consultation was a very important part of the exercise. The response rate to the consultation was very low&#151;in double figures&#151;but within it we captured all the people who were representative of the key bodies and stakeholders. Because the RSLs and the local authorities are the key organisations that are affected, we were able to consult them fully and to get a proper response from organisations such as Shelter that speak on behalf of tenants. The consultation exercise was robust and we got a good spread. It is probably worth quoting Shelter, which said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051254000040"></a>&#147;The effective abolition of the tolerated trespasser achieved by Schedule 11, together with the creation of new tenancies for existing tolerated trespassers, will ensure that the law is no longer tainted by the irrational consequences of this doctrine&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051254000038"></a>Certainly, Shelter is extremely content with what the order achieves.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051254000036"></a>I find myself a bit surprised that I have answered most of the questions raised by noble Lords. If I find that I have not answered any when I read <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow, I will do so in writing.</p>

<p>That the Grand Committee do consider the Report of the European Union Committee After Georgia. The EU and Russia: Follow-up Report (3rd Report, HL Paper 26)<I>.</I></p>
</ul>

<p><a name="09051269000001"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051269000181"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> First, I should make it clear that this report was very much put together under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Roper last year. Certainly, his strong work moved on from the original Russia report of May 2008, which came up with similar conclusions. There are no contradictions, but clearly events in Russia moved on quickly. The Russia-EU relationship and the issues discussed in this report are ever current. During the past week, we have had the NATO manoeuvres, a suspected mutiny of the tank corps in Georgia and strong language yet again between Georgia and Russia, with NATO interventions as well. We have had recent conferences about energy and pipelines and, of course, we have all the implications on Russia&#146;s economy of the worldwide credit crunch and financial crisis. This report is very much as alive and active today as when it was written. No doubt we could write another one, although we will resist the temptation, in a few months&#146; time.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000002"></a>The report concentrates on the war&#151;indeed, that is what it was&#151;between Georgia and Russia. The committee was clear that responsibility for the war was shared by all the parties. Indeed, we said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000157"></a>&#147;responsibility for the conflict was shared, in differing measures, by all the parties&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC359"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC359</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000003"></a>However, we felt strongly that the force used by Russia and its forces was entirely disproportionate, although we completely agreed that there were a number of provocative statements and other actions by Georgia&#146;s President Saakashvili. I was interested that the Government&#146;s response to the report also described Georgia&#146;s actions as &#147;reckless&#148; in this regard. The committee would very much agree with that.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000004"></a>Where we differed from the Government was that we felt that there were mixed signals to Georgia from the United States Administration, who had perhaps given the Georgian Administration overconfidence in trying to reclaim parts of South Ossetia. We believed that those signals were reckless and that the unfortunate consequences of the war that followed were very much shared by both sides. However, we cannot get away from the fact that the Russian response to whatever the Georgian provocations were was entirely disproportionate. We must keep that in mind as we consider the rest of the areas that this report covers.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000005"></a>The committee felt that the ceasefire was an issue on which the European Union had been particularly successful. Perhaps that was due to a strong presidency at the time. The actions of President Sarkozy were immediate. He was able to talk directly to President Medvedev of the Russian Federation and, through that, there was a ceasefire relatively quickly, there was a withdrawal at the time, even though it was not perfect, and there were talks in Geneva. We say in the report that that illustrated that this was an area in which the European Union, perhaps alone in this conflict, was able to intervene successfully and prevent this major conflict from becoming worse.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000006"></a>However, post-ceasefire, we have a number of  concerns, particularly over non-compliance by the Russian Federation and the limited access given to the EU monitoring mission to Georgia. We would be interested to hear from the Minister an update on the monitoring force and, most of all, on the fact that Russia has continued to occupy South Ossetia and Abkhazia with not just observation forces but other forces and has recognised them as independent sovereign states. We see that as regrettable and something that needs to be solved; the position needs to move back. Some of us in the committee commented that it is even more important now for the European Union to explain and maintain its position on Kosovo and to say why that recognition is not in conflict with our position on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000007"></a>On the Russian Federation more broadly in this conflict, one area of special concern to the committee was that of passports being issued outside the federation to new Russian citizens. We felt&#151;and some of our evidence showed&#151;that this practice was quite substantial. It may not be a problem in its own right and it is clearly within the sovereign right of a nation state, but we felt that, when tied in with the Medvedev doctrine of protecting the life and dignity of Russian citizens wherever they are, it produces a particularly dangerous combination for the future and is a signal that Russia would consider intervening in other nation states where it felt that such protection was necessary. We felt that that was a new and dangerous step to take, particularly in relation to the Caucasus and Russia&#146;s near abroad.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC360"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC360</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000008"></a>On the economy, issues have arisen because of the fall in the price of oil, but again the committee felt strongly that the European Union should continue to encourage full integration of the Russian economy into a global setting and support its moves with regard to the World Trade Organisation.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000009"></a>We have also to consider the energy question. The committee looked at the second crisis that came along this winter in the Ukraine. We felt that the EU, frankly, did not apply the lessons learnt from the problems that arose in 2006. Indeed, the report describes this quite distinctly as a policy failure. Certainly the Russian Federation, when it turned off energy supplies to the Ukraine, seemed to have no regard to the response of the European Union and the effect on eastern and southern Europe in particular. There was no European influence at all; the presidency has not been effective in this area. The committee calls for a unified European energy strategy as a matter of key importance in our energy relations with Russia. We believe that the Nabucco pipeline and other ways of bypassing Russian influence over energy supplies to eastern Europe are important considerations. I know that there have been conferences on this recently and I would be interested to hear from the Minister where the Government feel that Europe is going in this area.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000010"></a>The crisis was started because Russia was very sensitive about the agreement that Georgia and Ukraine could apply to join NATO. In considering this, the committee felt that maybe this was not the most important thing to pursue in the short term. In military areas, the emphasis should be on practical co-operation between NATO and those two states. We felt that the NATO decision added to bad feeling between Georgia and Russia and was not helpful towards resolving problems in the short term. However, the committee welcomed the Eastern Partnership, launched by the Czech presidency. It is a good policy tool with which to work with Georgia, Ukraine and the other eastern states, because European Union membership is something that should be actively pursued over time.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000011"></a>Overall, as the Obama Administration might have said, the committee has not pushed the reset button. In fact, the relationship between the EU and Russia needs to remain hard-headed, pragmatic and unsentimental. We should continue to strive for a partnership and co-operation agreement, but it needs to be made on a different basis according to a new agenda and should include issues such as counter-proliferation and climate change. There is also a great need to try to unfreeze those frozen conflicts that are bound to unfreeze themselves in a hostile way if they are not solved diplomatically. Obviously, Moldova is part of that.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000012"></a>Russia is clearly an important neighbour and one of the major European powers. It does not always play by the rules that the European Union would like it to play by&#151;indeed, Europe has been pressed and divided more by Russia&#146;s actions than by actions in other parts of the world&#151;and it very much challenges European unity. Our conclusion is that there needs to be a pragmatic relationship and that Europe needs to be much more unified and hard-headed.</p>

I congratulate him particularly because he inherited the report from his predecessor.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000014"></a>My starting point is the first editorial in yesterday&#146;s <I>Financial Times</I>, which was headed: &#147;Talk to Russia, Remember Georgia&#148;. That neatly summarises the appropriate response to Russia in the current warmer climate, although there are clearly cooler patches, as the noble Lord indicated.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000015"></a>From the heady confrontation of last August during the invasion of Georgia, we are moving towards a more mature relationship with greater recognition of the convergence of interests between the European Union and Russia, but we cannot, as the <I>Financial Times</I> editorial has said, ignore the old concerns.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000016"></a>In its first report, the committee&#146;s analysis of relations between the European Union and Russia is generally broadly correct. Both reports were based on evidence from a variety of sources, and, I like to think, provide a useful compendium for those outside Parliament to gain an indication of the subject&#151;something which I thought particularly important when I had the honour of chairing the Foreign Affairs Committee in the other place. Its conclusions are linked to our committee&#146;s report on the European Union security strategy, which we published at the end of last year. Gone are the naive assumptions about Russia in the 1990s, for example that Russia was just like us. We clearly need a deep understanding of Russia&#146;s history and geography. One wag said that history is geography spread over time.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000017"></a>There have been quite significant changes since our first report in May last year. That report was correct at the time, but as has been said in another place, an amendment has been moved since then. One amendment is the world recession, which has had an effect on Russia. In the 1930s, after the Wall Street crash, Soviet Russia was largely insulated from the recession at that time. The new globalisation affects Russia too; the fall in oil prices has had a marked effect on Russia&#146;s budget assumptions. Perhaps one can also detect in Russia&#146;s foreign policy a certain reduced arrogance, as was noted in the speech last week of Mr Rogozin, Russia&#146;s ambassador to NATO, and the greater willingness on the part of the Russian Federation to explore areas of co-operation with the West.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000018"></a>The second major change was the election of President Obama. Perhaps we were all expecting far too much in this case. I was in Egypt yesterday, and there were enormous expectations of him, not only in the Middle East peace process but in the coming speech on 4 June on relations with the Islamic world. In all parts of the world, there are perhaps unrealistic assumptions about what change means and what we can realistically expect from the new US Administration. It is clear that the new Administration gives high priority to discussions with Russia; one thinks of the speech of the Vice-President at Munich. The signals are very positive in broad terms, even on Afghanistan; although Russia was clearly instrumental in helping to persuade the Kirghiz Government to close the US base, which

There is a new spirit of co-operation and new opportunity, and unnecessary provocations have been put on hold. Last week I was in Washington where it was clear that, whereas perhaps six months ago we would have been talking about the problems of the siting of missile installations in the Czech Republic and Poland and about NATO expansion to Georgia and Ukraine, those have now been frozen&#151;they are not frozen conflicts, but frozen initiatives. That is a useful change.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000019"></a>As the noble Lord has said, we still have the tit-for-tat over spies and there were problems when NATO had its recent well planned military exercises in Georgia, but the indications are positive, particularly in respect of non-proliferation and the preparations for the non-proliferation treaty. The European Union, with regard to our eastern partnership, is perhaps rather less ambitious. There were mixed motives anyway; in part, this was a response to President Sarkozy&#146;s initiative last July in respect of the Mediterranean, an initiative that is meeting broadly the same problems as the Barcelona process.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000020"></a>There are continuing areas of concern, as we mentioned in our first report. There is the Russian pressure on Ukraine. We looked particularly at problems of energy security, not only in January this year but in 2005 and 2006, and the fear that Russia, by encircling the European Union, is trying to make us increasingly dependent on Gazprom and Russian energy institutions generally. Certainly, a number of countries in the European Union and those outside it such as Serbia appear to be playing largely to the European game.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000021"></a>We said in our report that we hoped that the danger of Russian encirclement and the danger of dependency on Russian gas supplies would lend a new impetus to the Nabucco project. I hope that the Minister will say something about this. Yesterday the press were telling us about an agreement reached last Friday between the European Union and Turkey that, again, is designed to break the stranglehold; it would allow a pipeline to cross Turkey to Azerbaijan and possibly, even later, to go underneath the Caspian to bring in supplies from Turkmenistan. This is important and I hope that my noble friend will say a little more about the agreement with Turkey and its significance.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000022"></a>The main change, as the noble Lord who opened this debate said, is that since we produced our report last May, there has been the Russian invasion of Georgia. I shall not talk about the responsibility for that; it is clear that there were Russian military exercises in the area shortly before the invasion, but it is also clear that there were provocations by the Georgian president. We now have a much more nuanced approach to the responsibility, which, we hope, will be made clear in the report to be produced in a few months by the Swiss diplomat who is examining the issue on the ground. Both sides are rather more guarded now, but clearly Russia is in breach of its international obligations in the agreement that was reached between President Sarkozy and President Medvedev last August. Russia has recognised the breakaway provinces and has been  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC363"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC363</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>joined only by Nicaragua. It has failed to withdraw to the old frontiers prior to the invasion. There is some evidence of ethnic cleansing in South Ossetia, particularly in Abkhazia. There are increased military personnel, more than envisaged in the Medvedev-Sarkozy agreements. The noble Lord has referred to the Russian build-up of the naval base and other military bases in Abkhazia and the barring of access, to a large extent, for EU monitors.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000023"></a>This is clearly a major breach by Russia. I recall some years ago reading a learned article by a US academic in foreign affairs who said that he was sitting in his car in Grosvenor Square when he looked up and saw the high point of diplomatic wisdom, which said: &#147;Do not enter box unless your exit is clear&#148;. If we apply that to Russia in today's circumstances, it is sad that there is no clear exit. There is no exit strategy for withdrawal from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Ideally, a diplomat would say that it is our job to provide a ladder down which Russia can climb, but given the developments in those two provinces, the loss of face would presumably be too great and we are likely to be saddled with those areas of insecurity for some considerable time to come.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000024"></a>It would be helpful for my noble friend in his reply to tell us our prognosis for Abkhazia and South Ossetia. There is indeed a great deal of thuggery and it is said that there is not a warm relationship between North Ossetia, in the Russian Federation, and South Ossetia. Is it our assumption that Russia will eventually annex those two breakaway provinces and continue its military build-up? What are our aims in the area? Do we realistically expect Russia to withdraw?</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000025"></a>What is clear is that the Russian invasion of last August and its subsequent activities are very much in breach of and undermine the proposals made by President Medvedev for a new security architecture in Europe, both before and at the time of the Evian conference last September. I concede that the proposals are still very broad, but they involved the recognition of territorial integrity and the inviolability of frontiers. That has clearly been breached by the Georgian invasion. The more worrying section of the Medvedev proposals concerns the special responsibility for Russia and its near abroad and for Russian citizens&#151;particularly when, as in Ukraine and elsewhere, they are producing many new passports for those citizens. I would hope that at the very least, looking at the possibilities in the Crimea and Moldova, there will be renewed emphasis on the part of the European Union and NATO on cauterising or dealing with the frozen conflicts in the near abroad that can further complicate our relations with Russia.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000026"></a>In conclusion, we clearly need to work together with Russia. We need to build bridges. We need to build an infrastructure of understanding, both culturally and commercially. Where we can, where there is clear mutuality of interest, we need to work with the Russians&#151;yes, in Afghanistan&#151;in arms control, perhaps the most promising of the areas concerning the Non-Proliferation Treaty; on the technical side of NATO, in bringing new life to the NATO-Russian Council in air-sea rescue and other matters. We need to be ready

<p><a name="09051269000027"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051269000183"></a>Lord Crickhowell:</b> I, too, must thank the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, for his admirably clear presentation of the committee&#146;s conclusions. As he indicated, one thing we have certainly learned in Sub-Committee C over the past 18 months is that you cannot carry out a major inquiry, put it on one side and think that you have finished. When we produced our first report on the European Union and Russia in May&#151;we started in July 2007&#151;the oil price was rising above $100 a barrel, the Russian economy was being buoyed up by high energy prices and foreign currency reserves were about $425 billion, with another $140 billion in a stabilisation fund. If the prospects for the medium and long term were uncertain, the immediate questions were about Russia&#146;s use of its sovereign funds and the scale of its overseas investments. When we published the follow-up report nine months later, the oil price was around $50 a barrel and, as we stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000141"></a>&#147;Russia&#146;s economy has been severely affected by the financial crisis and global economic downturn&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000028"></a>In the first report, we identified the common neighbourhood, Russia&#146;s &#147;near abroad&#148;, as a particularly sensitive area that should be treated as such by both parties, but we did not foresee the war in Georgia that took place two months after its publication. Perhaps we should have done, or at least been more conscious of the possibility of an explosion in an area where causes for conflict can be traced back for generations, and which one witness described as a &#147;very brittle, explosive country&#148;. There is also plenty of evidence that, whatever the provocation given it as its excuse, the Russian military had been preparing for its intervention for a considerable period. As the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said, its response was disproportionate.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000029"></a>While the EU&#146;s reaction, led by President Sarkozy, was &#147;rapid and reasonably successful&#148;, in paragraph 21 of our report we stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000142"></a>&#147;We are seriously concerned that Russia has not complied fully with the ceasefire agreement ... Full Russian compliance with the ceasefire plan should continue to be used as a measure of Russia's behaviour, even though such compliance is unlikely in the near future&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000118"></a>In paragraph 23 we added:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000143"></a>&#147;It is essential that the mandate of the EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM) is renewed later this year and is allowed to exercise its agreed tasks in full on both sides of the border&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000119"></a>The reality is that there have been and continue to be serious breaches of the ceasefire agreement and the monitoring mission has not been allowed to carry out all its agreed tasks.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000030"></a>Russia is a hugely important trading partner; it is the provider of much of our energy resources and it has the potential to be an important ally on issues such as nuclear proliferation and terrorism. It is in Europe&#146;s interests to be patient and show understanding of Russia&#146;s feeling of humiliations suffered, but Europe has to be robust as well and make it clear that no progress can be made on matters such as the partnership

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000031"></a>In this context I want to say a word, as both the other speakers have, about NATO&#146;s role in the sensitive area of Russia&#146;s &#147;near abroad&#148;, which has become Europe&#146;s &#147;near abroad&#148; as well. I refer to the evidence of Sir Roderick Lyon about the three questions that should be asked about potential NATO members:</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000158"></a>&#147;would it be good for the country in question, would it be good for NATO and would it be good for European security?&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09051269000120"></a>He did not think that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000159"></a>&#147;awarding Membership Action Plan (MAP) status to Ukraine and Georgia increased their security at all; rather it had the opposite effect&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051269000121"></a>Had Georgia already been a member of NATO, that would not have prevented the war. Sir Mark Lyall Grant&#146;s view was that NATO was not ready to extend the Article 5 guarantee, which was fundamental to NATO, in circumstances where there were difficulties within Ukraine and attacks on Georgia&#146;s territorial integrity.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000032"></a>We suggested that the ongoing disputes over  missile defence and NATO enlargement risked further complicating EU-Russian relations and that, without drawing back on the commitment to eventual membership,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000160"></a>&#147;the focus should remain in the immediate future on practical cooperation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051269000122"></a>In the event, this May we have had tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats and a military exercise in Georgia that has provoked Russian anger, just at the moment that President Obama is seeking to improve relations with Russia. It does not appear obvious that the decision to hold this exercise, even if it was small in terms of numbers and aimed at disaster relief, was a good idea. However, perhaps Russia wants to respond positively to the President&#146;s initiative, and last Friday Dmitry Rogozin, Russia&#146;s envoy to NATO, made conciliatory remarks. Surely every effort should be made to respond in a positive way.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000033"></a>We also stated in our report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000144"></a>&#147;The EU has an important role to play in strengthening the economies and democracies of both Georgia and Ukraine&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000123"></a>Last week, at a meeting in Prague, the EU sought to intensify political and economic ties with six former Soviet republics, including Georgia and Ukraine, while seeking to reassure Russia that it was not trying to assert itself in Moscow&#146;s former sphere of influence. The Eastern Partnership programme announced in Prague, which pledged $799 million in aid from 2009 to 2013, was perhaps inevitably greeted with suspicion in Moscow and not with great enthusiasm by some of the countries which should benefit. They argued that it was insufficient at a time of political and economic distress. A majority of the leaders from Europe&#146;s biggest nations, including France, Britain and Italy, stayed away from the meeting. Only Chancellor Merkel of Germany attended. I doubt if that is the right signal to send to our eastern neighbours and I hope that the Minister will explain Britain&#146;s absence from a meeting which could have important consequences.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000034"></a>The events in Georgia in August last year were followed by an interruption in gas supplies through Ukraine in January this year. That interruption resulted  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC366"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC366</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in significant reductions in supplies for a number of European countries. Martin Ríman, the Czech Minister for industry and trade, described the gas crisis as,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000161"></a>&#147;unprecedented in the history of gas supplies to Europe&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051269000124"></a>Michael Davenport from the Foreign Office told us that the proximity of the Georgian conflict to key energy transit routes in the Caucasus had highlighted their fragility. He urged that the EU should be more proactive in bolstering the prospects for improving supply routes to the west from the Caspian Sea, and the proposed Nabucco pipeline was part of that picture, but that it would work only if it was commercially viable and there was sufficient gas available to channel through it from, in particular, countries beyond Azerbaijan, such as Turkmenistan. At paragraph 43 of the report we pointed out that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000162"></a>&#147;little progress has been made to safeguard gas supplies to EU Member States in eastern, central and southern Europe through the diversification of supply and delivery routes. This policy failure needs to be remedied urgently&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051269000125"></a>At paragraph 44 we stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000145"></a>&#147;Events since our last report have increased the importance we attributed to the EU&#146;s having a unified energy strategy, including an interconnected and liberalised internal market in energy, especially gas&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000126"></a>At paragraph 45 we emphasised that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000146"></a>&#147;More vigorous action needs to be taken by the EU to diversify gas supplies, to increase gas storage capacity and to encourage the development of the Nabucco pipeline&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000127"></a>All these recommendations simply reinforced what we had urged in our original report. During our first inquiry, Professor Dieter Helm from Oxford had explained to us the Gazprom strategy of increasing its market power. The Baltic pipeline, Nord Stream, had been part of a strategy to reduce the pivotal role of Ukraine. Deals with the Caspian states to send gas north through Russia had undermined the alternative non-Russian pipeline proposals for Europe, and the special relationships with German and other large European companies had helped to secure the Russian position.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000035"></a>In response, Europe failed to speak with one voice and EU member states pursued a strategy of bilateral relationships with Russia and Gazprom. The relationship of the German company E.ON and Gazprom is deep and the Baltic pipeline is essentially a German-Russian project. Other countries have followed by making their own separate deals. Faced with external dependency and market power the obvious strategy is to build up internal resilience. Completing the European electricity and gas networks would increase the ability to render mutual support while reducing costs. Strategic gas storage and diversification of sources of supply would add resilience. Although the Commission has been attempting to shift policy in this direction, progress has been slow and in the case of strategic gas storage practically non-existent.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000036"></a>Russia at present cannot produce enough gas to meet its own demand, let alone supply Europe as well. In the short term it has solved the problem by taking Caspian gas north. Dieter Helm, responding to a question from me, pointed out that a pipeline from the Caspian through Turkey does not solve our security of supply problem. It just means that less gas is available in Russia to service its own market and that therefore less gas is available from Russia to come  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC367"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC367</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to Europe. However, it would increase Europe's bargaining power and reduce Russia&#146;s ability to suddenly curtail supplies.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000037"></a>All this is important for the United Kingdom as well as the rest of Europe. The UK faces increasingly critical security of supply problems. Gazprom has insisted that its European customers or partners sign long-term take or pay contracts. The Germans have done it, the Austrians have done it, and more recently the Italians and the French have done it. When we have a winter when there is a supply shortage, the price of gas to the UK rockets and no gas flows. When that happened a couple of years ago, the Prime Minister and the Energy Secretary talked about markets behaving irrationally. Dieter Helm commented:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000147"></a>&#147;What did they expect to happen? These were long-term take or pay contracts and that is the form&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000038"></a>I emphasise that the UK has as great an interest as the rest of Europe in a concerted European approach based on the interlinking of supplies and storage. The gas companies will not find storage commercially attractive and may need substantial inducements to provide it, but the North Sea is a natural zone for gas storage and as a deposit for carbon sequestration, which also has to play an important part.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000039"></a>While some of us were in Brussels last Thursday as part of our current inquiry into the EU&#146;s relations with China, there was an interesting exchange at Questions in this House. I welcome the fact that the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, announced that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000163"></a>&#147;the Government strongly support the development of the southern corridor, which would bring gas from the Caspian, via Turkey, into Europe. This would increase UK and EU energy security by diversifying both sources and routes of gas supply. The Nabucco gas pipeline has the potential to form a key part of the southern corridor and, as such, it has the Government&#146;s strong support&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000040"></a>My noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford, who I am delighted to see in his place and who will speak shortly, was sceptical. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000148"></a>&#147;That, of course, depends on Russian willingness to see an under-Caspian pipeline from Turkmenistan, and that in turn depends on the attitude of the President of Turkmenistan and the President of Azerbaijan&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 7/5/09; cols. 661-62.]</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000041"></a>He asked whether it would not be much wiser to develop our links with Norway, which has unlimited gas to supply us, and to develop our own storage systems and import more LMG. I hope that despite the difficulties we will throw our weight behind efforts to achieve a southern corridor route. Of course, we must press on with storage and do our best to get the gas we need from Norway. But it is not obvious why Norway, with a population of 4.5 million and with more cash coming its way than it can possibly use in the short term, should accelerate the depletion of its resources to assist a neighbour which has depleted its resources as fast as it possibly could and is now running short.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000042"></a>If I were a Norwegian, I would expect my Government to extract a very good price for the additional supply. Norway also has other interests. A year or so ago it had to abandon all its rigs for a time because of Russian military activity in the area. With the opening up of the Arctic zone&#151;my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford has written very cogently on the importance  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC368"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC368</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of that area&#151;and increasing disputes about who owns what in this potentially hugely important area, the Norwegians will want to talk to the Russians and remain on good terms with them. The trouble is that it is more expensive than gas delivered through pipelines and, when demand is high, the ships tend to get diverted to where the price is highest.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000043"></a>In conclusion, it must be in the United Kingdom&#146;s interest to back to the hilt the kind of European energy policy for which we pressed in both our reports. We cannot stand aside and say that these matters do not concern us. It will not be easy to find a way forward. Germany, with its Russian contracts, and France with nuclear power as well, may be reluctant to play the part that is required if Europe is to have a sensible energy strategy, but for such central players in the European project to leave their eastern and southern neighbours vulnerable, and Russia holding Europe in a potential stranglehold, cannot be good politics or sensible economics. It is time that Europe started to protect its own interests by acting together in this vital field of energy security.</p>

In welcoming it, the Government endorse the importance&#151;the committee noted this&#151;of the EU&#146;s swift reaction to the crisis in Georgia and its facilitating a ceasefire agreement. The Government rightly recognised the EU&#146;s ability to use military and civilian tools to foster stability and enhance security in that area at an international level.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000045"></a>As noble Lords have already mentioned, the exact circumstances surrounding the outbreak of conflict in August 2008 are unclear and will probably remain so. However, we should support efforts within the European Union, particularly those of umbrella institutions, as they work towards attempting to establish conditions for meaningful dialogue between Russia and Georgia, who are both members of the Council of Europe. They meet in a democratic parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg and there is an opportunity for their peers within the European Community to hold both of them to account in democratic debate. It is right that they should, and can, be held accountable for the actions of their military and civilian personnel during and after this war between the two states. I shall make further reference to Russia, Georgia and the European Community in due course, but both parties should be investigated for breaches of international humanitarian conventions. Russia should be held to meet in full all international commitments and obligations, particularly those agreed under the Sarkozy peace plan. The attempts by Russia to move the goalposts by claiming that the separatist areas of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have evolved as if by magic into sovereign independent states while they remain clearly under Russia&#146;s patronage should be rebuffed.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000046"></a>The Government&#146;s response to the committee&#146;s report was prepared some two months ago and events have moved on in various directions and to varying degrees.

<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC369"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC369</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concerned that Russia had not complied fully with the Sarkozy-Medvedev peace plan. The Government were right to point out that the plan to militarise the breakaway separatist regions under the fabricated &#147;bilateral&#148; agreement further violates Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity. Their view is shared by the international community and the European family of nations: the EU, the UN and the Council of Europe. The key requirements of the ceasefire agreement were the withdrawal of Georgian military forces to their usual bases and the withdrawal of Russian military forces to the lines they held before the hostilities broke out. The latest reports from international monitors show that the deployment of Georgian troops continues to be in line with the provisions of the ceasefire agreement, that there has been no increase in troops from the Georgian side, and that special police force units are being replaced by the regular police force in that country.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000047"></a>The major cause of Russia&#146;s lack of compliance and heightened instability in the region is to all intents its unilateral recognition of the so-called independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The international community agrees that this instability is heightened by Russia&#146;s assertion that deploying troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia is a matter of bilateral agreement with the de facto authorities in the breakaway areas and therefore is no longer governed by the ceasefire agreement. This is frankly ludicrous when, out of the 211 United Nations member states, only Nicaragua has joined Russia in recognising the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000048"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, mentioned the issue of Russian passports to non-Russians. When Russian parliamentarians were challenged about this recently, they claimed that Russian passports had not been issued to non-Russian citizens in South Ossetia; the South Ossetian authorities had issued South Ossetian passports to citizens in that area. I will be grateful to hear whether the Minister has any news because that is clearly an interesting development in the status of the areas concerned. In short, the international community has concluded that while Georgia has not fully complied with all the ceasefire agreement demands, Russia has failed to comply with most of them. In fact, Russia could be seen to be moving further away from the minimum conditions for a meaningful dialogue.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000049"></a>A key factor in the continuing instability in the region appears to be the uncertain status of the international monitoring commissions. The denial of access to the breakaway areas by the de facto authorities in South Ossetia and Abkhazia creates a major obstacle to implementing the incident prevention and response mechanisms agreed by the parties at the talks in Geneva in February. Clearly these procedures are essential if security and stability are to be established in these volatile areas and renewed confrontation is to be avoided. I think I am right in saying that the next round of Geneva talks is scheduled for 18 and 19 May, and I would be grateful to the Minister if, in his reply to the debate, he could provide us with an update on  these plans and confirm, if it is known, whether the agenda includes establishing new security mechanisms  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC370"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC370</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#151;an area of debate at previous meetings&#151;and agreement on the principles of the non-use of force in these areas.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000050"></a>In the mean time, refusing access to OSCE and EU monitors to the volatile breakaway areas is impeding progress. Could the Minister also confirm the Government&#146;s position on the actions needed to avoid further deterioration in security and stability? Could he refer in particular to actions to reverse the further militarisation of the breakaway regions, to which noble Lords have referred on a number of occasions today, and to implement the agreed incident prevention and response mechanisms, including joint visits by observers to the breakaway areas; to withdraw restrictions at points of entry for humanitarian aid; and to respect fully the rights of return of internally displaced persons as a result of this conflict.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000051"></a>At present, the situation seems to be moving further away from establishing the minimum conditions for a meaningful dialogue between Russia and Georgia. For example, as noble Lords have mentioned, there are claims by the Georgian Government to have put down a brief mutiny by a tank battalion&#151;alleged, by the way, to be part of a Russian-inspired coup attempt to depose the Georgian president. Of course, Georgia&#146;s hosting of NATO training exercises, with 1,000-plus troops drilling close to areas where Russian troops are still stationed in South Ossetia, generated the retort from President Medvedev that the action was an &#147;overt provocation&#148;. The meeting last week between EU nations and the &#147;supplicant six&#148;, as I call them&#151;the &#147;near abroad&#148; post-Soviet countries that form the Eastern Partnership&#151;is being interpreted as a move to counter Russia&#146;s proclaimed rights in its buffer region. All these developments illustrate a move away from meaningful dialogue to resolve the Russia-Georgia issues by Russia and Georgia, and they do nothing to address growing concerns over the humanitarian consequences of the war as set out in recent reports in the international community.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000052"></a>The conflict resulted in some 130,000 people being displaced in Georgia, with 26,000 internally displaced persons still in centres in Tbilisi and elsewhere nine months later. But the humanitarian concerns are in fact far deeper than that. In addition to the recent IDPs, the Georgians have indicated that there are a further 225,000 resulting from earlier conflicts, particularly people from Abkhazia. In total, therefore, more than quarter of a million IDPs are suffering in inadequate centres that fail to meet minimum living standards, threatening the health and well-being of children and the elderly in particular.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000053"></a>In conclusion, it is clear that the humanitarian consequences of the war between Georgia and Russia are far from being resolved. There is a climate of fear on all sides of hostilities being renewed. Solutions need to be found to ensure that an effective international presence remains in the region, providing guarantees for security and human rights. New approaches need to be found to open up dialogue between the international community, the de facto authorities and, of course, the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Both Georgia and Russia have a responsibility to see that this happens.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000054"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051269000185"></a>Lord Hannay of Chiswick:</b> It is right that we should have the opportunity again to debate the important issue of the EU&#146;s relations with Russia, even quite soon after our previous debate. Much is happening in that relationship and not all of it is for the good. The hard fact is that the European Union does not have a functioning across-the-board policy towards Russia. Until it does, we shall be easy prey to Russia&#146;s divide-and-rule tactics.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000055"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and his colleagues on a truly excellent supplement to last year&#146;s report that takes full account of the events in Georgia last August and of the effect of the economic crisis on the Russian economy, and thank them for so generously inviting me to participate in their discussions of it, despite the fact that by then I had moved on to a different part of the European Union Committee&#146;s firmament.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000056"></a>First, I have a couple of comments about the Government&#146;s response to this report. They bridle at the suggestion that mixed signals from Washington may have contributed to President Saakashvili&#146;s lamentable decision to try conclusions with the much superior Russian military forces, a decision which, quite rightly in my view, the committee characterises as &#147;reckless&#148;. No doubt the president listened to those voices in Washington that were saying what he wanted to hear, and chose to ignore any cautious advice he may have received from the State Department. A simple reading of the American press, however, would show that there were plenty of voices egging him on, and that not all of them were very far removed from the former Administration. The lesson to be learnt is the crucial importance of avoiding loose rhetoric and misleading indicators when dealing with a situation as combustible as that in the Caucasus. Fortunately, the new US Administration seem to have learnt that lesson.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000057"></a>A second point on the government response: it was a bit of a pity that the Government missed the opportunity to set out in full the compelling reasons why the analogy drawn by the Russians between the cases of Abkhazia and South Ossetia on the one hand and of Kosovo on the other was self-serving. The Government simply swatted it away without explanation. If one wants to look for such an analogy in recent international relations, one finds it not with Kosovo but with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. There, too, an entity was carved out of a sovereign, independent member of the United Nations whose territorial integrity all had agreed to respect. There, too, military force was used, substantial ethnic cleansing took place and only one country recognised the new entity. The irony is that Russia, and before it the Soviet Union, has always been among the most vociferous critics of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. So when the Russian Foreign Minister waxes eloquent about others&#146; double standards&#151;he was an old sparring partner of mine in the 1990s, so I am sure that he will not resent what I say&#151;he should perhaps take a glance in the mirror.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000058"></a>Kosovo&#146;s autonomy under the old Yugoslav constitution&#151;and these seem to be the bullet points as regards saying that Kosovo is quite different&#151;was  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC372"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC372</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unilaterally withdrawn by President Milosevic against the wishes of 90 per cent of its inhabitants. A repressive regime was installed which committed many gross abuses of international humanitarian law. Now, the new constitution of an independent Kosovo guarantees the rights of the Serb and other minorities&#151;not something that is noticeable in the Abkhaz or South Ossetian constitutions, if they have them. More than 50 countries have recognised Kosovo&#146;s independence. That is quite a contrast, I should have thought.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000059"></a>Clearly, as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, and others have said, energy will be at the heart of any relationship between the EU and Russia, now and for the foreseeable future. It is here that the EU has so far lamentably failed to get its act together. The consequences were there for all to see during last January&#146;s stand-off between the Ukraine and Russia over gas supplies. The remedies are not difficult to identify: a more unified and more competitive internal energy market, the building of interconnectors between the gas supply pipelines of different member states, the diversification of the EU&#146;s sources of external supply and of the pipeline networks leading westward into Europe, and the ability to speak to Russia with a single voice.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90512-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000060"></a>One further remedy seems to receive too little attention; and I was delighted to hear the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, who knows much more about these matters than I do, giving it a good deal of emphasis: the establishment of much more extensive gas storage facilities throughout Europe. After all, there are EU obligations on member states to hold a minimum supply of oil for facing the event of a supply interruption. Why do we not have similar obligations for gas, which is even more vulnerable to interruptions? I was glad to see in the Government&#146;s reply to the report that this issue is to be looked at during the course of the year. Will the Minister say what line the Government will take during that review? Will he assure us that they want to see an increase in gas storage capacity, including in this country?</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000061"></a>It is also important not to present the case for an EU policy on energy and energy security as simply an anti-Russian gambit. That would be quite foolish. No conceivable amount of diversification of supplies, development of renewables and nuclear or increases in energy efficiency will rid us of a considerable long-term need for supplies of Russian oil and gas, just as no amount of Russian development and diversification of its overseas markets will rid it of a considerable dependence on the EU market for its oil and gas exports. So we need to learn to get on better together and to co-operate in this area, which is of obvious mutual advantage. It is entirely legitimate and indeed highly desirable for the European Union to reduce its present vulnerability to a single supplier, but not in doing so to ignore our interest in a better long-term relationship with that supplier. Perhaps the Minister could say something about progress in the negotiations for a new agreement between the EU and Russia and whether it will cover these vital energy issues.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000062"></a>No recent development in Russian foreign policy arouses more concern than President Medvedev&#146;s so far fairly vague references to Russia having a &#147;sphere of influence&#148; or &#147;privileged relations&#148; with the countries  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC373"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC373</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the former Soviet Union. Russian actions in Georgia and the handing out of Russian passports to many citizens of these countries have only added to that concern. Are we to interpret this as a mere passing manifestation of post-imperial nostalgia, an affliction with which we have had some familiarity ourselves, or is it something more sinister and dangerous? Whichever it is, surely we must neither collude with it nor condone it. The 21st century has no place for such pre-First World War concepts, which in any case ended in disaster for all concerned. The European Union is surely right to pursue its Eastern Partnership with those countries, but must ensure at the same time that nothing is done behind Russia&#146;s back and that the fullest consultation takes place at every stage in the development of those relations.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000063"></a>The picture of EU-Russia relations is one that presents opportunities but which also has plenty of clouds hanging over it. President Obama&#146;s decision to try to reset relations between the US and Russia, and the recent reopening of bilateral negotiations on strategic nuclear arms, is such an opportunity since the interconnections between EU and US relations with Russia can hardly be in doubt. However, we need a clear European strategy and a will to implement it if we are to put the opportunities on offer to good use, and that strategy so far is lacking.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000064"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051269000186"></a>Lord Selkirk of Douglas:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words in the gap, especially as I did not give notice beforehand that I would speak. On the day that Georgia was invaded, I wondered whether the developments would have the effect of invalidating the original report on the European Union and Russia. If I may say so, the noble Lords, Lord Roper and Lord Hannay, made tremendous contributions to the excellence of that report. All parliamentary colleagues worked hard on it, but those noble Lords in particular went the extra mile right up until the end of December. We are most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, for taking the helm thereafter.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000065"></a>The follow-up report seems to have a different emphasis in urging that we should be more hard-headed. However, the policy of constructive engagement, which has been called for by the Foreign Secretary, remains every bit as valid today as it was at the time of the original report. Paragraph 325 starts by stating:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000149"></a>&#147;Despite the difficulties, Russia cannot avoid dealing with the European Union on trade, on competition, on customs and frontier controls, and on a variety of other issues involving the EU&#146;s common standards and regulatory procedures&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000128"></a>The report goes to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000164"></a>&#147;they are bound by an inescapable common interest&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051269000129"></a>Perhaps even more important, paragraph 326 stresses that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000165"></a>&#147;both Russia and the EU have an interest in co-operating on long-term global issues such as the environment and climate change&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051269000130"></a>All this is as true today as when it was written. But I should like to make three brief points arising from the follow-up report. The first is in relation to Ukraine&#146;s application to join NATO. It is in the public interest that the EU and NATO speak with great clarity.  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC374"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC374</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We are all aware that Russia has a dread of potential military encirclement which it would regard as a provocation. I note that on 23 June 2008 in RIA Novosti, a news agency in Moscow, Ilya Kramnik wrote,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000166"></a>&#147;what consequences will Russia face if Ukraine joins NATO? ... Tensions on Russia&#146;s western borders will rapidly go up. At present, NATO&#146;s tactical aircraft can reach Moscow in about an hour. Their flying time would be reduced to 20-25 minutes ... Tensions between Russian and the West would escalate; and the political climate, which already leaves much to be desired, would finally slide to the worst times of the Cold War&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000066"></a>I have to say on the other hand that the Government of the Ukraine have taken an entirely different view and have applied to join NATO, with the support of our present Government. It is entirely possible&#151;indeed, likely&#151;that a future Government would adopt a similar policy. The Foreign Minister, Caroline Flint referred to legitimate aspirations.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000067"></a>Incidentally, I thought that the wording of the follow-up report was absolutely appropriate. In Paragraph 58 it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000150"></a>&#147;It is clear from the NATO ministerial meeting in December that there is no prospect of early NATO membership for either Georgia or the Ukraine. Without drawing back from the commitment by NATO to the two countries&#146; eventual membership, the focus should remain in the immediate future on practical cooperation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000131"></a>I draw to the Minister's attention the need for clarity and realism in decision-making and timescales, because Russia needs to know what we mean by legitimate aspirations, and we need to be aware of Russia&#146;s concerns about what it believes to be military encirclement likely to increase tension. History shows that where clarity is absent, there is a risk of miscalculation, misinterpretation or misunderstanding, which can lead to trouble that we want to avoid; so I call for clarity and realism.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000068"></a>Secondly, we should take the trouble in the EU in maintaining a dialogue. Paragraph 313 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000151"></a>&#147;We believe the EU should consult in depth with the Russians over all aspects of the European Neighbourhood Policy with regard to countries which were formerly part of the territory of the USSR, but should not give them a right of veto over EU policy&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000132"></a>Paragraph 314 states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000167"></a>&#147;the EU should take account of Russia's interests and concerns in the formulation of its policies towards the Central Asian countries&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051269000133"></a>As a matter of principle, we are obviously anxious to seek good relations with Russia, but it is every bit as important that we have good relations with her neighbouring countries, referred to as her near abroad.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000069"></a>My third point is that the attacks on the British Council, which have not been mentioned so far today, were extremely high-handed. They are seen in Britain as being totally unnecessary and a serious setback for British-Russian relationships. Perhaps the Minister could say a word about the up-to-date position of the British Council. Surely finding a solution should not be beyond the wit of humankind. Our report was emphatic in stating at paragraph 299 that the attacks on the British Council were seen as,</p>
<ul><a name="09051269000168"></a>&#147;a part of a wider political strategy to pressurise the UK and the EU into giving ground on other, unrelated issues&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051269000134"></a>That is very unsatisfactory.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000070"></a>I also have to report that there have been some encouraging signs. I note that Mr Rogozin, who is Russia's envoy to NATO, has said that Moscow is ready to go ahead with restoring ties to the NATO alliance, which had been frozen. General Mattis, the Supreme Allied Commander&#151;</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000073"></a>In conclusion, there are a number of positive signs, which we have welcomed. For example, when Soviet sailors were saved from their stricken submarine,  Mr Putin honoured them with medals and signed an agreement with Prime Minister Tony Blair against terrorism. We encourage such constructive engagement, but we must do so on the basis of realism that is hard-headed and thoroughly pragmatic.</p>
<h5><a name="09051269000175"></a>6.29 pm</h5>

He put a very interesting emphasis on the delicate and subtle balances that are needed in this relationship between the EU and Russia. The complexities are enormous and it is very difficult to reach tangible conclusions in a very fluid situation. Therefore, we await with interest the Minister&#146;s response because of his great experience of these matters, the UN relationship with the then Soviet Union and, later, the new Russia and all that that meant for international peace in the future.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000075"></a>I am also glad that my noble friend Lord Teverson was able to take over as chairman of this report. I thank him and his colleagues on the sub-committee for an excellent job and a nuanced but balanced set of conclusions. The noble Lord, Lord Selkirk, and my noble friend Lord Teverson reminded me of that very important aphorism&#151;I suppose that is the right word&#151;from Voltaire who said that superstition could put the world into flames, but only wisdom could put out the fire. We have heard some very wise suggestions from both of them and other contributors to this debate.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000076"></a>I, too, share the concern that has been expressed today about how the West reacted in the early days of the new Russia emerging. The naturally free and energetic press in the West denounced many things in Russia&#151;from bandit capitalism to the oligarchal fiddling of the privatisation programme, terrible attacks on journalists, the murder of journalists and so on. It rightly referred to those matters and presented President Putin in a somewhat bad light, often referring to his KGB background. While understandable, these things can be viewed differently in Russia. It is never a weakness for us to consider what those in another country feel. Even members of the Russian population who were not slavish adherents of the majority Nationalist  Party or particularly keen on President Putin and his   


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC376"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC376</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>successor&#151;although his successor has a somewhat more popular rating&#151;were put off at the initial stages of that change in the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 by the condescension of the West towards Russia. The country was viewed as sort of a problem child which needed severe attention of the wrong kind rather than a friendly, helpful and positive relationship.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000077"></a>I hope and believe that, fortunately, bad moment has passed and is long since gone. Now there is a much more realistic appraisal of the matters that we need to keep in purview, but there is particular anxiety, which I understand fully, in this report, in the West and elsewhere in the world, about the near abroad area of Russia, which several speakers have mentioned. I was very struck, for example, with the suggestion made by Roderic Lyne in giving evidence. In paragraph 60, page 20, he mercifully says that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000152"></a>&#147;Russia did not represent a direct threat to the West, nor did he think that Russia would now annex a Member State of the EU&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000135"></a>That is a fairly dramatic assertion, but I was glad to read that in the report. He continued:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000153"></a>&#147;The greatest threat was Russia&#146;s potential self-isolation but he insisted that Russia and the West were no longer on opposite sides&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000136"></a>Page 21, paragraph 64 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000154"></a>&#147;Roderic Lyne also thought that the EU needed an agreement with Russia but &#145;a different sort of agreement and maybe several agreements rather than one&#146; ... He warned that Russia had started to make clear four or five years previously that it did not want a partnership; the EU had not adjusted its course in response&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000137"></a>That therefore aided and abetted the process of vociferous differences in the member states of the EU in their individual approaches to Russia and the scramble for energy supplies, particularly led by Germany after it had already asked the European Commission to formulate a common European energy policy, which was a glaring example of that.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000078"></a>In the conclusions, paragraph 96 on page 26 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000155"></a>&#147;The ongoing disputes between Russia and the West over missile defence and NATO enlargement risk further complicating EU-Russia relations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000138"></a>That must be handled with great care by the Americans. There is every sign now that Obama is just the right person for this role as the new president in making sure that the Americans do not overstate their own case and their objectives.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000079"></a>Paragraph 97 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051269000156"></a>&#147;It is clear from the NATO ministerial meeting in December that there is no prospect of early NATO membership for either Georgia or the Ukraine&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000139"></a>Once again, the noble Lord, Lord Selkirk, rightly emphasised the difficulty that Russia would face if the Ukraine became a member of NATO. While we would welcome it, the future role of NATO itself needs to be clearly enunciated and constructed because it seems to me and to many people in the West that NATO&#146;s role has been one of &#147;keeping going, jobs for the boys and let&#146;s find an artificial role in Afghanistan&#148;. I am saddened that I have to say that. I hope that the role in Afghanistan works out now, but it clearly was something that the Russians were very worried about and thought was extremely provocative at the time.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000080"></a>I emphasise, as does the report&#151;I think that we are all of one mind on these matters in today&#146;s debate&#151;that the EU has to act with one combined foreign policy stance on Russia-EU links. I assume that the Minister will confirm yet again that Lisbon would help that process. It is not essential but it would make it much easier. I think that Lisbon is more important for other, non-foreign policy matters, but that, too, would be a positive step. I echo what my noble friend Lord Chidgey said about the huge anxiety about the situation in Georgia. The UN stance is tellingly pro-West in this sense and therefore we have to accept that Russia must heed those words of warning. Yesterday, Putin referred to the future and perhaps switching again. Members of Parliament in the other place talk about switching house ownership in terms of primary residence, but in Russia they talk about switching the president and the prime minister. His references were fairly disturbing as he sounded determined to resume his role as the president. In that case, I do not know whether President Medvedev would become prime minister.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000081"></a>I warmly endorse the report&#146;s sensible conclusions. I feel that there is a positive future if we can only keep the balance. There are still serious problems, including others that have not been mentioned today. The Middle East peace process is not addressed in the report but Russia should surely be playing a much bigger part in that with other quartet segments. It does not seem inclined to do so, but is now hosting meetings more often; that may be a good sign. It really needs to get involved in that. Moldova is a tiny country with huge problems and is situated next to Romania, with the anxiety that Moldovans feel about that. They are desperately keen to get into the EU but that will take a long time in view of their severe poverty and all the problems associated with that. Russia is its near neighbour and is watching the situation very closely.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000082"></a>I believe that there is a positive future if this country follows a common EU line on these matters. The sooner we achieve that, the better. I hope that the Minister will endorse that concept when he winds up.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000083"></a><b><a name="90512-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051269000190"></a>Lord Howell of Guildford:</b> I join in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, his team, and his predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Roper, on tackling this vast issue with such gusto and so comprehensively. You hear people say that Russia has problems, is flawed, has a declining population and is over reliant on oil and gas. However, it remains a huge factor in the global equation. Despite its declining population, it is a nation of colossal innovation and ingenuity and should never be underestimated. It stretches from Europe at one end right into the areas of growing power&#151;the areas where the global pattern will be decided in this century and the next: the rising areas of Asian dynamism.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000084"></a>The relations between ourselves and this huge area&#151;this fantastic nation&#151;are enormously complex and have not been going very well. Indeed, in the follow-up report, Sir Roderic Lyne speaks of a deteriorating spiral in relations between the US and Russia. After the publication of the original report in May last year, that would apply to the whole situation, including the UK-Russian relationship in particular, which has been  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC378"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC378</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>especially fraught and marked by almost incomprehensible and very frustrating things such as the attacks on the British Council, which my noble friend Lord Selkirk rightly mentioned. Those are a very bad stain on the Russian behaviour pattern which we should not brush aside but should keep returning to.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000085"></a>Since the original report last May, we now have plenty of material for a follow-up report. We have had the Georgian saga, which, as my noble friend Lord Crickhowell said, was unpredictable, except in the sense that we all know that Russia has been raging around in the Caucasus for the past 250 years since the days of Shamil and long before, so perhaps there is no long-term surprise at Russian involvement. I could not help saying to some Russian friends after the Georgian affair, when they said that they would like to restore a commonwealth out of their near neighbourhood, that if they wanted a commonwealth, perhaps they should learn from the British approach, which is, on the whole, to embrace and support our Commonwealth members rather than to invade them, which might not be quite such a good way of making friends. The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, and others have spoken with great knowledge on the Georgian situation. It is deeply unsatisfactory, but there we are.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000086"></a>Then there was the Ukrainian gas saga, which was very predictable. That comes around from time to time, and we are going to hear a lot more about that. I shall say more about it in a moment. Then there was the reputed offer from the new President, Barack Obama&#151;I am not sure that we have got to the bottom of this&#151;suggesting that if Russia co-operated more on the Iran question, it would be possible to wind down the anti-missile systems that are placed, from the Russian point of view, bizarrely and provocatively at the eastern end of Europe. It may be that the deal was the other way around&#151;if the Russians co-operated, the missiles would be reduced&#151;but either way the Russians saw it as a quite unacceptable proposition and turned it down. If it was true, and it was never confirmed officially, it opened up the interesting possibility of areas of very detailed co-operation with a different sort of Russia in the new world which we are now in.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000087"></a>Meanwhile, in the year since the original report, the rule of law has become even more distorted in Russia. There is more and more evidence of criminality and corruption&#151;in very high places, I am afraid&#151;and a general feeling that dealing with the Russian bear is getting more difficult, not easier. I agree with the guiding theme of both the original report and its follow-up, which is hard-headed and practical engagement rather than isolation, despite all the difficulties and provocations. I am sure that that is the right approach.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000088"></a>I confess that, rather like my noble friend Lord Selkirk, I found the follow-up report rather more attractive than the original, which, frankly, I found quite disappointing. The original report seemed to be based much more on hope and &#147;wishing it was so&#148; with regard to EU co-ordination&#151;longing for Europe to speak with one voice, to co-ordinate its policies and to be united&#151;than on reality, which is probably a better basis on which to build our policy. The reality is that different EU members have very different interests depending on their history, their position, their proximity  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC379"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC379</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to Russia, their energy needs and a whole variety of other considerations, and that will continue. Professor Cooper reminded the committee of that back in the original report in clear and brutal terms. I wish it were not so. Indeed, we can all wish that, but we have to be realistic and hard-headed about where to start building our policy initiatives. The follow-up report struck a much more practical and hands-on note than the original.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000089"></a>On energy aspects, I am not so happy. My noble friend Lord Crickhowell very kindly referred to me and made some very perceptive and well founded remarks. We may have the seeds of a debate here of the sort which, ideally in your Lordships&#146; House and in committees, can tease out how we should position ourselves in the United Kingdom on energy needs and energy security in the next 10 or 20 years. We agree on one thing; the Russian supply system is not 100 per cent reliable, to put it mildly. I had occasion, a few years back, rather naively to ask Mr Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, whether Russia would use its energy resources as a diplomatic weapon. He looked at me pityingly and said, &#147;Of course&#148;. We have no doubt that that will continue.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000090"></a>What worries me about the original report and the follow-up report is that there are one or two rather serious omissions from the whole picture. First, there is no mention in either report of the fact that part of the Russian strategy is to find new customers in the East and to build new pipelines, one of which is now under rapid construction to China from south-central Asia, to supply both China and Japan and to meet the colossal demands of the very fast growing economies, whenever they recover from the present recession, which will manifest themselves in Asia. That is a bigger issue.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000091"></a>Secondly, I am not sure that the central question about the Nabucco pipeline has been grasped. The central question, which the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, and other noble Lords have touched on this afternoon, is whether there will be enough gas to make the thing even remotely commercial. This is not just a question of collecting gas in Baku but whether the pipeline under the Caspian from Turkmenistan can be built, whether the Turkmenis and their President are prepared to send the gas that way rather than eastwards to Asia, and whether the Russians will allow that pipeline to be built under the Caspian. They are raising every difficulty. The latest I heard was that they are worried that the pipeline will vibrate so much that it will disturb the sturgeon and reduce the output of caviar. They appear to be prepared to use any argument about the Caspian part of the pipeline, although they have different arguments for building their own pipeline under the Baltic, as we have heard.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000092"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, rightly says, all this really does matter to us. It is true that we are not very reliant on Russian gas at the moment compared with the seven EU countries that are 100 per cent reliant on it. Many others, such as Germany, are  57 per cent reliant on it, so it sounds as though we need not worry too much, but that is very wrong. Dieter Helm said as a witness in the original report that we are &#147;terribly exposed&#148;, because we have not  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC380"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC380</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>built replacement nuclear stations. In the 10 years ahead, we will have to go for carbon capture and storage if we can work it out, which we have not done yet. We will certainly have to go for many more gas turbines and will drink a whole lot of gas to produce our daily electricity and to keep the nation warm. We will also rely substantially on Norway and on liquid natural gas imports from Algeria, Qatar and various other points including Norway and even Russia. It is in our interests as a nation, rather than as the broader EU, and in the interests of our energy security to see that these sources are not diverted to a gas-hungry central Europe. It therefore follows that we have an interest in seeing alternative sources of gas come through to central Europe from places other than unreliable Russia. That is the central point that we need to keep in mind when we consider our energy security as a nation within the broader context of the EU.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000093"></a>I should add that in the medium term&#151;unfortunately, I do not think that the report gets around to this&#151;we may all rely much less on Russian gas altogether, whether or not it can fulfil its contracts in the short term, not least because of the enormous boom in US natural gas production. So far this has hardly been noticed, or even recorded, by the IEA or indeed by energy officials in this country, but the US probably now has 2.2 trillion cubic feet of gas available to it and is considering mounting a major programme of LNG exports back to Europe on a colossal scale. That is enough gas to supply America&#146;s entire needs for gas for 100 years ahead. This will change the whole scene with regard to Russia, and will probably necessitate another report by our tireless colleagues. It will begin to alter the pattern of relationships with Russia; it will remain important, but the situation will be different.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000094"></a>It is excellent to have this superb debate and to hear the views of so many experts. Generally in all this, I see the danger of relying too exclusively on the hope, the wish and the fingers crossed that something will come up in the nature of a closer, more co-ordinated EU energy policy. If we are concerned about clarifying and advancing our own interests, the EU dimension is vastly important, but we must be careful about relying on it exclusively and about interpreting our interests solely by looking through the EU lens. We will find that lens extremely blurred and not the ideal optical instrument to look clearly, coldly and precisely at our own interests and concerns in the years ahead.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000095"></a>I hope that future reports will adopt a slightly different perspective from the one in the original report, and I hope that they will build on the practicality and excellent focus of the follow-up report on the immediate issues. In the longer term, Russia needs us, we need Russia, and some kind of modus vivendi&#151;peace, democracy, any other broad concept that one likes to use&#151;must be developed. Russia will remain a highly powerful element in the global future, and we in Europe need to work out exactly how to get on with it. It will be difficult but we must keep trying.</p>

The Government welcome it and believe that it makes  an important contribution to our understanding of EU-Russia relations following the crisis in Georgia.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000097"></a>We considered the immediate aftermath of that crisis during the debate on the committee&#146;s previous report on EU-Russia relations on 10 October last year. The Europe Minister has already written to the committee on the key conclusions and recommendations made in the report. None the less, I welcome the opportunity to take stock almost a year after the crisis and, like other speakers today, revisit some of the key issues. I very much agree with the committee and the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. Although I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, would perhaps take exception to this, many of us feel that the EU&#146;s response to the crisis in Georgia and the successful negotiation of the ceasefire agreement showed that the EU can play a crucial and successful role in international affairs. It highlights the EU&#146;s ability to use a wide range of tools, including military and civilian, to ensure stability and security internationally.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000098"></a>As the Europe Minister highlighted in her response to the report, the Government welcome the committee&#146;s support for our and the EU&#146;s overall policy of residence towards, and pragmatic engagement with, Russia. Obviously, Russian actions in the South Caucasus ran counter to Moscow&#146;s international commitments and raised serious questions about its approach to European security, and indeed to the international community as a whole.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000099"></a>However, we all quickly concluded that isolation was not an option and that it is only through engagement and hard-headed, frank discussion, including through rules-based organisations&#151;the OSCE and others&#151;that we can build a constructive relationship with Russia, and that that is in both the UK and the EU's interests.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000100"></a>Let me say a word about the report&#146;s emphasis on the importance of continuing negotiations to the EU-Russia partnership and co-operation agreement, the tone and pace of which are being informed by Russia's actions elsewhere. Those who caution that we must ensure that it reflects a new agenda, one which takes cautionary lessons from the security issues as well as bringing in new issues such as climate change, speak wisely. The report's emphasis on engaging Russia in multilateral fora such as the G8, but also the G20, and in important issues such as the Middle East peace process and Iran, is key. Those issues will be discussed at the next EU-Russia summit next week.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000101"></a>I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, that just yesterday in New York Foreign Minister Lavrov chaired a Security Council session on the map, which my right honourable friend David Miliband also attended. The Russians are trying to co-operate on Middle East peace. Predictably, they want to give it a bit of a colouring of their own&#151;they feel that they need to find a place again in the process&#151;but I think that we would all agree that that is a constructive engagement.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000102"></a>More broadly on the question of US-Russia relations and the famous reset button, what is striking about the Obama Administration in these early months is not so much idealism about these issues as the opportunity to  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC382"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC382</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be rather pragmatic and realistic and escape the ideological tone of so much of the previous Administration's dealings on issues such as Russia. Although there is a lot of hard work ahead, and American diplomats caution that this will be a long, hard process trying to get agreement on everything from missile issues to Iran, and so on, talks are progressing. We have noticed the early commitments that both sides have made to try to do something about nuclear weapons arsenals.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000103"></a>To the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, I say that we very much support Russia's accession to the WTO, which we think will help its economy as well as supporting global trade and reducing protectionism. I know that it has a very oddly shaped economy, with such a huge dependency on energy exports and very little else, so it is an odd country to squeeze into the WTO arrangements, but that can only help to diversify its economy and open up areas that are, frankly, highly uncompetitive and untransparent.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000104"></a>An area of really constructive engagement with Russia lately has, curiously, been the global economic crisis. I visited Moscow in March ahead of the London summit on my salesman&#146;s tour to get support for the summit. It became very clear during discussions with Foreign Minister Lavrov, who, it is true, is a very old friend of mine from UN days, that there was a high degree of convergence on international co-operation to tackle the crisis. It is a little invidious to say who were the helpers and who were the problems when it came to the G20 meeting itself, but I think that President Medvedev could be described as having had a pretty good visit to Docklands. He was helpful on a number of international economic issues.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000105"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Selkirk, said, that should not disguise the persistence of some very pernicious issues, of which the British Council is very much one. I should reassure him, as I think he knows, that the British Council continues to operate an excellent and widely valued programme of activities in Moscow and from that base to other parts of Russia.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000106"></a>In terms of the forced closure of the council office in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg in January of last year, there is at least some progress in the court action against the British Council for reassessment of their tax bills. It is proceeding well with the council assessing that the final decisions of the appeal court gave a fair assessment of what it should pay. While the political level remains blocked, on the alleged casus belli, the tax arrears of the British Council, a court process is under way. As I have said, we all welcome the resumption of the EU PCA negotiations. We believe that it remains the appropriate vehicle for that wider constructive engagement.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000107"></a>Let me now turn to some of the specific issues raised. As regards Georgia, the Government agree with the committee&#146;s conclusions that whatever the origins of this conflict, Russia&#146;s use of disproportionate force, which extended the geographical range of the conflict and the scale of the fighting, had no justification. There was also no justification for Russia&#146;s violation of Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity, which continues, I am afraid to say, to this day. We remain concerned that Russia has not complied fully with the Sarkozy-Medvedev agreements. Russia maintains troops  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC383"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column GC383</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inside the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and has not withdrawn to pre-conflict positions. It also maintains a presence at Perevi, beyond the South Ossetian administrative boundary line.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked about the monitoring mission. While the EU&#146;s intervention prompted Russia&#146;s withdrawal from most of the Georgian territory outside the separatist regions, the EU monitoring mission has conducted more than 3,000 patrols and is a key player in diffusing tensions in the areas adjacent to the administrative boundary lines. The UK continues to provide an input to that EU monitoring mission. It contributes 11 equipped monitors. Nevertheless, it is clear that these monitors do not have access to all parts of Georgian territory. The UK continues to lobby Russia to influence the separatist authorities  to allow this as called for in its mandate.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000109"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, said, the humanitarian situation is a major concern. The noble Lord characterised accurately the human consequences of the conflict, which is why we are pressing for a political solution which allows these individuals return or resettlement. We hope that the work of this EU monitoring mission creates a space for humanitarian organisations to operate.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000110"></a>Several times, the issue came up of the comparison of Kosovo to South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Of course, we benefit from the erudition of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, on all matters diplomatic. He is absolutely right that north Cyprus in some ways offers a much better parallel and analogy. We are not surprised that from his encyclopaedic diplomatic memory he pulls this out, although this is an issue with which he is closely associated. However, I found less plausible his feigned surprised at such a double standard in diplomacy. He of all people would expect nothing less from this art form to which he has devoted his career.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000111"></a>As to Kosovo and the Kosovo precedent, we are all aware that that is an extremely partial comparison, as it ignores 10 years of UN administration, the efforts of international mediation to resolve the crisis, the UN-sanctioned international administration and an international security force operating there under UN authorisation and mandate. By contrast, in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, it was a land grab following several weeks of fighting and there was no such international legitimacy.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000112"></a>In order not to run over my time, your Lordships will forgive me if I turn immediately to say a word or two about energy issues, a subject raised by many noble Lords. I have not been able to give proper attention to some of the other issues such as passports, which I am happy to come to in writing because there is an update. We are all aware that we have to get the EU-Russia and, for that matter, the UK-Russia energy relationship right. It is critical to our security and critical to Russia&#146;s security in the sense that it is her main source of income. We recognise on our side that any overreliance on a single supplier poses a risk to all of us in the EU and that we have to have a strategy which pursues diversification of both sources and routes of supply. The EU Spring Council conclusions build on the Commission&#146;s second strategic energy

We look to the review as a means of finding ways to move forward. It has already observed that the Ukraine-Russia dispute remains as predictable as night follows day by coming round again and again. Over time, a solution must be found. I want to assure the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that in terms of our own plans, we are seeking an increase in gas storage facilities, including here in the UK.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000113"></a>Several noble Lords referred to the Nabucco pipeline/southern corridor issue. Let me just say that the UK is a strong supporter of the Nabucco pipeline as part of the southern corridor to bring Caspian gas to the EU market. At last Friday&#146;s Prague southern corridor summit, participants agreed concrete actions on  Nabucco that include a commitment to sign the key intergovernmental agreement by June. This is a concrete development that we welcome. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, asked whether there will be enough gas. It is important to say first that we are not looking to replace Russian and other sources of gas; the goal is to create additional supplies and diversification. He is right to say, however, that the quantity of gas in the Caspian region is unknown, although significant reserves have already been discovered and identified off Azerbaijan. Several noble Lords commented on the potential of sourcing gas from central Asia&#151;Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan&#151;which may offer greater supplies. I have rather rushed my response to this important set of issues, but I hope that I have touched on the main concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, and others.</p>

<a name="90512-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051269000114"></a>Let me close by thanking the committee for its hard work. Like others, I suspect that the members will have to put pen to paper again before long because this is not an issue that will go away. However, I align myself with those who believe that they have taken a hard-headed look at the position. I am not one of those who think that looking at so much of it through the lens of EU co-operation necessarily means that they have taken their feet off the ground; quite the opposite, I hope that it means that they have them placed firmly on the rock of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="09051269000116"></a>The thing that struck me throughout this debate was the importance of Russia and its presence to our east in Europe. It is impossible to ignore and we have to get on with Russia. Perhaps there is a chance that the United States will even have a better relationship with Russia than Europe does. One thing that has been clear during the committee&#146;s studies of the EU

That particularly suits it in terms of its major export, energy. Perhaps the lesson that we need to learn from the crisis between Russia and the EU is that it is up to Europe to respond both as individual member states

<h2 align="center"><a name="09051232000135"></a>Children: ContactPoint</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09051232000003"></a><b><a name="90512-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09051232000126"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09051232000004"></a>On 26 January, I announced to the House the first steps to deploy the Government&#146;s online directory&#151;ContactPoint. I can today provide an update on progress in delivering ContactPoint, and outline the next steps.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09051232000005"></a>ContactPoint has been developed in response to a key recommendation of Lord Laming&#146;s inquiry into the tragic death of Victoria Climbi&#233; and is a vital tool designed to help keep children safe. In order to protect children it is crucial to ensure that the right agencies are involved at the right time and to improve the sharing of information between practitioners. ContactPoint will also help practitioners to improve outcomes for all children. It is a tool for practitioners to support better communication among practitioners working with children and young people across education, health, social care and youth offending services in the statutory and voluntary sectors. It will provide a quick way for those practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child or young person and ensure their best interests are promoted.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09051232000006"></a>Under current arrangements, if a practitioner believes that a child is at risk or may need additional support, for example if they have a disability, they may have no way of knowing whether other services have been, or are already in contact with that child. In addressing these issues, the Government estimate that ContactPoint, when fully operational, can save at least 5 million hours of professionals&#146; time, currently spent trying to track down who else, if anyone, is helping the child. Supporting professionals in this way is an important element of the plan of action I announced last week in response to Lord Laming&#146;s report on child protection. Lord Laming said in that report, &#147;the new ContactPoint system will have particular advantages in reducing the possibility of children for whom there are concerns going unnoticed&#148;.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09051232000007"></a>Since January, important progress has been made. Seventeen early adopter local authorities in the north-west of England, along with leading national charities, Barnardo&#146;s and KIDS, now have trained management teams in preparation for practitioners to start to use the system. At the same time, as part of the extensive ContactPoint security arrangements, local authorities have shielded the records of children who are potentially at greater risk if their whereabouts were to become known, to provide an additional layer of security, (for example, if a child is fleeing domestic violence or is under witness protection, or in some cases where children have been adopted). Approximately 52,000 records have now been shielded on ContactPoint.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS80"></a><b>12 May 2009 : Column WS80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09051232000008"></a>Building on this work, we will continue to take an incremental and steady approach to delivery. We are now moving ahead with the second phase of delivery. From 18 May, and over a period of several weeks, ContactPoint early adopters will train around 800 practitioners to use ContactPoint. They have been hand-picked to ensure they reflect the broad range of professionals working for children&#146;s services organisations who will use ContactPoint when the directory is fully rolled out. We will carefully monitor the activity of those practitioners considering what further improvements may be required in the light of their experience of using the system.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09051232000009"></a>From June to August, we will train management teams in the other local authorities and national partners. This will allow them to prepare for deployment of ContactPoint more widely in due course.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09051232000010"></a>Throughout this second phase, we will continue to evaluate the experience of early adopters. This will ensure that the deployment of ContactPoint continues to take account of the experience of new users in the next stages of delivery.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09051232000011"></a>ContactPoint continues to be supported by major children&#146;s organisations, such as NSPCC, Barnardo&#146;s, Action for Children and KIDS, teachers&#146; unions including NASUWT, as well as the Association of Chief Police Officers, the British Association of Social Workers, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Children&#146;s Inter-Agency Group whose members include the LGA and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09051232000052"></a>In discussion, member states agreed with these three priorities and that the single market was essential for EU economic recovery and growth. In addition, several member states highlighted the importance of avoiding protectionism and better implementation of single market legislation. All member states agreed that EU enlargement since 2004 had brought positive benefits to the EU. Member states suggested that future EU developments should be an increased focus on skills, innovation, the low-carbon economy, promoting EU standards externally, more cross-border internet sales, boosting consumer and social benefits, or delivering concrete achievements, such as a community patent.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="09051232000053"></a>The UK agreed with the forward looking suggestions by the Commission and other member states. We stressed the need for the EU to be at the high end of the value chain, noting in particular business opportunities in low carbon, digital and services. We also pointed out that the UK is the sixth<sup></sup>largest manufacturing country in the world and that we wanted the single market to work equally well for the manufacturing sector. In addition, we welcomed the Larosiere report on EU financial supervision and called for an integrated approach to better regulation and enforcement of EU single market rules.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="09051232000054"></a>The Commission also presented a paper on the EU better regulation programme and invited member states to share best practice from national programmes. Most member states were supportive of the EU action programme on administrative burden reductions. Several member states wanted the action programme to take account of new and amending regulations. Member states also wanted better impact assessments on Commission administrative burden reduction proposals. The UK representative stressed the need for cooperation and dialogue between member states on better regulation policies and for stronger EU impact assessments. We also suggested that the EU services directive should be an exemplar for EU legislation and that its implementation by the end of 2009 was important for EU's future competitiveness.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="09051232000055"></a>The UK strongly supported the Commission's proposal to allow member states the option to exempt micro-entities (companies with 10 or fewer employees and less than &#8364;1 million turnover) from the EU accounting directives, which would bring major cost savings for the EU's smallest businesses. Germany, Denmark and Romania also stated their support for the proposal.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="09051232000060"></a>I am today announcing the release of a consultation into proposed changes to the allocation mechanism for years 2 and 3 (2009-10 and 2010-11) of housing planning delivery grant (HPDG). HPDG was established in 2007 to reward local authorities for improved delivery of housing and other planning outcomes as part of their strategic, place-shaping role and to provide more support to communities and local councils who are actively seeking to deliver new homes. The decision to review the grant scheme follows our public commitment to monitor the grant in light of changes in economic circumstances.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="09051232000062"></a>The quantum of funding available for HPDG was set in a different economic context than where we are today. We remain committed to the short and long-term objective of increased housing supply and will continue to invest significant sums through HPDG for local authorities who deliver more homes, with funding doubling from &#163;100 million in Year 1 to &#163;200 million in Year 3. In addition, there will no longer be a capital element to the grant. However, current economic conditions have created new priorities both for Government and local authorities; we have therefore taken the decision to scale back the increase in HPDG and focus on delivering real help to the people who need it&#151;and so have halved the rent increases facing council tenants this year.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="09051232000064"></a>We are also consulting on changes to the way the grant is allocated to ensure it recognises current challenges and encourages positive action by local authorities to facilitate recovery. Key reforms being proposed are:</p>
to reduce the threshold of net additional homes needed to qualify for the housing element in year 3 in recognition of the more challenging conditions in the housing market;to introduce additional eligibility requirements for demonstrating land for housing in order to reinforce existing requirements in planning policy statement 3 and increase confidence in the land supply position across the county; and to increase the percentage of the planning element awarded for demonstrating land for housing in year 2 in recognition of the importance of land supply in supporting development.
<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="09051232000065"></a>We are also consulting on proposals for an additional HPDG element in year 3 specifically to incentivise the delivery of affordable housing.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="09051232000067"></a>Meaningful community involvement is an integral part of the planning system. The White Paper <I>Communities in Control: real people real power</I> announced up to &#163;4 million additional funding for local planning authorities to promote community participation in planning. This funding is in addition to HPDG; however we propose to use the HPDG mechanism to distribute this additional funding. The proposed allocation criteria would support those authorities whom we would expect to be undertaking significant community engagement work, either in developing their core strategy or delivering high levels of new housing, and who have already identified community empowerment as a priority for their overall performance.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="09051232000070"></a>I have today published a consultation paper that proposes the non-implementation and repeal of the right to enfranchise (RTE) provisions in the 2002 Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act (the 2002 Act).</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="09051232000071"></a>The 2002 Act sought through the RTE provisions to prevent what was at that time acknowledged to be a fairly limited problem. This was qualifying leaseholders being deliberately excluded when fellow leaseholders exercised statutory rights to purchase the freehold of the building containing their flats (called collective enfranchisement). However it has become clear that implementation of the provisions would introduce a considerable amount of additional burdens, complexity and cost into the process.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="09051232000072"></a>The Government&#146;s view is that this would be to the overall detriment of leaseholders in general who are benefiting from the changes that have been made by the 2002 Act and earlier legislation to remove unreasonable barriers to enfranchisement.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="09051232000073"></a>Leaseholders will in due course also benefit from the introduction of regulations on accounting for leaseholders monies which will complete the programme of reform introduced under the 2002 Act.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="09051232000074"></a>The consultation runs until 3 August 2009 and the Government would welcome responses to their proposals up until that date.

<a name="90512-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="09051232000076"></a>I have today published a consultation paper, <I>Park Home Site </I><I>L</I><I>icensing</I><I>&#151;</I><I>Improving the Management of Park Home Sites</I>, that proposes the introduction of an improved park home site licensing system.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="09051232000077"></a>Licensing of park home sites is currently governed by the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 (the 1960 Act), but the existing site licensing regime does not fully meet the needs of this part of the housing sector. Authorities in general are obliged to grant licences to anyone owning a park home site regardless of their suitability and cannot impose any condition relating to its management. Some sites are therefore run by unscrupulous or incompetent persons, and residents&#146; rights and expectation are often not met, some becoming victims of exploitation and intimidation.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="09051232000078"></a>The Government want a thriving and well-run sector that provides sites where people want to live. We want a licensing system that raises and maintains standards on sites and ensures they are safe, well planned and properly managed with appropriate facilities and services to meet the needs of residents.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="09051232000079"></a>The consultation builds upon decisions about proposals taken following an earlier consultation in 2005 and sets out for further consideration how the new licensing system might look. Persons engaged in the management of park home sites will need to demonstrate they have the relevant competences to manage sites. The new system will give local authorities duties to impose management conditions in licences and a range of enforcement tools to ensure that site licensing conditions are complied with. It will also allow local authorities to recover their costs in connection with their duties under the new provisions by charging appropriate fees. The proposals are intended to drive up the management standards in this sector and, in those parts of it where that is not possible, we intend to give local authorities powers to put alternative management arrangements in place.</p>

<a name="90512-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="09051232000080"></a>I have also today published a paper setting out the Government&#146;s response to the May 2008 consultation <I>A new approach for resolving disputes and to proceedings relating to Park Homes under the Mobile Homes Act 1983 (as amended)</I>. The paper sets out the Government&#146;s intention to transfer the jurisdiction on appeals and applications under the Mobile Homes Act 1983 from county courts to residential property tribunals. The paper also includes a short consultation on additional protections for residents subject to proceedings in relation to the termination of their agreements following on from the previous consultation.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="09051232000081"></a>The aim of the transfer of the jurisdiction is to provide residents of mobile homes (including caravans) and the owners of sites on which they are located, with a level playing field in the resolution of disputes, by

<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="09051232000082"></a>Park home residents and the sector more widely will benefit from the introduction of these proposals and will build upon build upon work already done to assist and support residents and others with an interest in park homes.

Due to the exceptional economic circumstances the Low Pay Commission asked the Government for more time to produce their report to allow them to take into account more recent economic data when making their recommendations.

The commission has recommended that the adult hourly rate of the minimum wage should increase from &#163;5.73 to &#163;5.80. The commission has recommended increasing the development rate, which covers workers aged 18 to 21 year-olds, from &#163;4.77 to &#163;4.83. It has recommended that the rate for 16 to 17 year-olds moves from &#163;3.53 to &#163;3.57. It is recommended that these changes take place in October 2009.</p>

<a name="09051245000483"></a>Asked by <b><a name="90512w0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051245000370"></a>Lord Morris of Manchester</b></i></p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government further to the comments by Lord McKenzie of Luton in Grand Committee on 28 April (<I>Official Report</I>, House of Lords, cols. GC44-5), what is the justification for the breadth of the exemption of the Armed Forces from the Disability Discrimination Act 1995; and whether they have now reconsidered it.[HL3308]</p>
</ul>

<ul><a name="09051245000321"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_1"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government why they plan to maintain the exemption of Armed Forces personnel from the Disability Discrimination Act as a proportionate means of ensuring combat effectiveness.[HL3309]</p>
</ul>

<ul><a name="09051245000322"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_2"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government whether it is their policy that Armed Forces personnel should be treated differently with regard to the Disability Discrimination Act from police and fire services personnel.[HL3310]</p>

<ul><a name="09051245000323"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_3"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will propose an amendment to the Equality Bill to remove the exemption from the Disability Discrimination Act of Armed Forces personnel.[HL3311]</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="09051245000003"></a><b><a name="90512w0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09051245000371"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> The Armed Forces have an exemption from the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) because all service personnel need to be combat effective in order to meet a worldwide liability to deploy. This means that everyone who joins the Armed Forces undergoes a rigorous selection and initial training process to ensure that they can withstand the hardship and challenges of military service.</p>

<a name="90512w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="09051245000004"></a>The Armed Forces do not allow units to have a protected role or reduced commitment, which means that everyone is liable to deploy and to fight anywhere in the world, even if only in self-defence. Accordingly, the MoD has concluded that it is essential that exemptions from domestic and international disability legislation are retained. For this reason the Armed Forces' exemption from the DDA has been replicated in the Equality Bill. This is required to ensure the continued combat effectiveness of the Armed Forces, as decisions on operational effectiveness must be taken by MoD Ministers, accountable to Parliament and based on military advice, not by the courts. The Armed Forces must be able to determine and set their own standards, based on the tasks to be performed. The Government do not expect the rationale for the exemption from the DDA to change, hence there are no plans to remove this exemption.</p>

<a name="90512w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="09051245000005"></a>The Armed Forces perform a role which is fundamentally different from those of other organisations, such as the police and the fire services. All service personnel are weapons-trained and need to be able to

This involves deployment overseas and prolonged working in stressful situations and arduous environments. Service in the police and the fire services is intrinsically different, not least because there is no requirement for everyone to be weapons-trained, or to serve overseas for prolonged periods. The Government do not consider that a direct comparison can be drawn between service in such disparate organisations.</p>

It follows that the indicators of performance at the end of key stage 4 must be based on performance in comparable examinations.

The achievement and attainment tables only recognise qualifications which have been approved under Section 96 because it is unlawful for maintained schools to offer other qualifications. While independent schools can legally offer qualifications which are not approved under Section 96, these are not recognised in the tables because to do so would mean that the tables would not be comparing performance across a common set of qualifications.</p>

Ofqual has not determined whether iGCSEs meet these requirements because they have not been submitted for accreditation. However, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) conducted a comparability study into the extent to which iGCSEs met GCSE criteria and corresponding programmes of study required for use in England, the results of which are available on Ofqual's website at <a href="http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/309.aspx">www.ofqual.gov.uk/309.aspx</a>.
