<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they have any plans to modify the present programme for the control of badgers with respect to the increasing incidence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, TB in cattle is an extremely serious animal health problem. The Government are dealing with the disease on a broad front and on the basis of sound science. Bovine TB is, however, continuing to increase while our research, including the badger culling trial, is in progress. My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture has made clear that the Government are keeping the possibility of taking additional measures under review and will not hesitate to act if necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply. The Question was tabled some weeks before the present emergency. I apologise to the Minister if, for want of ministerial back-up, it places her in a difficult position. With regard to tuberculosis and badgers, does she agree that it will be some years before the Krebs-Bourne trials are completed? In the meantime, farmers--especially dairy farmers--and veterinarians are somewhat dissatisfied with the progress in the Krebs-Bourne trials. Indeed, the National Farmers Union has pulled out of the TB Forum set up in 1999. Does the Minister agree that it would be a good time, following the present emergency, to re-assess the Government's approach to badger control and tuberculosis in cattle?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the Government's approach to badger control and tuberculosis in cattle does not rely only on the Krebs-Bourne trials. We are making progress with those trials. All 10 trial areas are involved. In seven of them there has been proactive culling. Reactive culling and survey work has taken place in the other three areas. The noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, will be aware that the Select Committee on Agriculture in another place looked at the issue recently. The Government will shortly be responding to its report. The committee concluded that notwithstanding its support for the trials, carrying them through and getting the evidence we need, it was <P>


<a name="column_1115"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>also important that we assess policy options so that we have policies ready as and when results come out of the trials.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Acton: </B>   My Lords, I follow up the Question of the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, by asking the question which he so carefully did not ask: can badgers in fact spread foot and mouth disease?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, badgers are not a susceptible species for foot and mouth. Therefore, they cannot get it. Just as the noble Lord could spread foot and mouth on his shoes or anywhere else, badgers could do the same on their fur. But it is the movement of susceptible species that is the greatest danger.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister any information about the possibility that an AIDS-type virus in cattle, which is prevalent in the South West, may be weakening cattle and making them more liable to tuberculosis? Might not that be more of a nuisance than badgers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, we have a wide research programme in place looking at husbandry issues, cattle to cattle transmission and other possible wildlife sectors. In any disease situation the issue of potential susceptibility to disease is one matter we have to take into account. Therefore, the survey work that comes out of TB99, which is being done on affected herds, will be important in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew6"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm that it has been known for a long time that TB, both in humans and in animals, is a disease of malnutrition? There is a known selenium deficiency in the soils in this country. Selenium is closely associated with the immune system function. Dairy cattle, which seem to be most prone to TB, are under huge stresses with the amount of milk that they are expected to produce. Therefore, can she say what research is being done in this field?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-01_para0"></a>Furthermore, I understand that there is a child in Scotland who is suffering from bovine TB which is resistant to all antibiotics. I do not expect an immediate answer to this question, but is the immune status of that child compromised by his diet?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Countess, Lady Mar, is correct. I cannot answer that question immediately. There is close liaison between ourselves and the Department of Health. A liaison group is looking at the health implications of M. bovis. I stress that the number of cases of M. bovis in humans has remained constant for many years. It is not increasing. It is predominantly a disease among older people and is thought to be a recurrence of a disease that was contracted pre-pasteurisation. That is the current advice. The matter is being kept under review. So far as concerns the Scottish dimension, the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health sits on that liaison group.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-01_para1"></a>In relation to selenium deficiency, I am aware that that is one of the issues that has been raised as a potential factor in TB. We have vastly different incidences of TB in different parts of the country. There is a wide programme of research which has been extended. Details of that are available on our website. I hesitate to say that, but I am afraid that it is true.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that it is 28 years since I took the Badgers Act through the House of Commons? The connection was known then and the measure took account of it. However, since that time, vast sums of money have been spent and large numbers of badgers have been destroyed. Perhaps it would have been wiser to have pursued a medical or veterinary alternative. Can my noble friend assure the House and make it clear that, in many parts of the country, this problem does not apply? In those areas, badgers ought not to be persecuted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that badgers are persecuted in any area. We are trying to find out what are the necessary and appropriate disease control measures if it is clear that we have a wildlife vector such as the badger involved in the spread of bovine TB. I must remind my noble friend--although I know that he is aware of this--that 8,000 cattle are slaughtered every year because of bovine TB. It is a welfare issue for cattle as well as for wildlife. However, my noble friend is absolutely right to remind the House of what I said earlier in my remarks; namely, that different patterns of disease are seen in different parts of the country. The whole thrust of our work seeks to establish solutions and policy options that will allow badgers and cattle to coexist in good health.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell the House whether a vaccine is available for bovine TB and also a vaccine for foot and mouth disease, which is causing such concern at the moment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I shall respond first to the second question put to me by the noble Baroness. A vaccine is available for foot and mouth disease. It is not used in this country or throughout the European Union because use of that vaccine would result in compromising fatally our disease-free status. It is then impossible to distinguish between animals with antibodies through vaccination and animals with antibodies through disease. For that reason, there are enormous trade ramifications. The advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer has been not to pursue a vaccination policy. However, obviously at this time we are taking every option into account, including vaccination.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-01_para2"></a>No effective vaccination exists against bovine TB. A great deal of research is being carried out and considerable resources are being invested internationally to try to develop such a vaccine.

<A NAME="10227-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether it was appropriate for the trustees of the Victoria and Albert museum to announce to the press the appointment of a new director without first informing the present director and before the appointment had been confirmed by the Prime Minister.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum have acted wholly appropriately in this matter. At no time before receipt of the Prime Minister's approval did the trustees make an announcement about the new director. An error, not committed by the trustees, resulted in the name of the new director becoming known to museum staff and the press. The current director knew that, at the expiry of his five-year term, he would be succeeded at the end of an extended term running until his 60th birthday. The recruitment campaign for his successor was also public knowledge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, I should first declare an interest, in that the present director, Dr Borg, is a friend of mine. I thank the Minister for that Answer, but I should like to press him as regards this error. Does he think that it is right that a public body--that is, the chairman and trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum--should send, without thought, an open fax to the museum giving the name of the new director before informing the present incumbent? He learned the name of his successor from his staff. Surely that is not the behaviour that we expect from a public body. The chairman and trustees should be censured. The matter demonstrates the height of discourtesy. To describe this as a mere error made at the end of a long professional career is not something that I have ever seen happen before.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am very sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, has thought fit to ask that question. I shall answer it. The error occurred because a fax sent from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which concerned the subject of the press release and included the name of the new director, was sent to Dr Borg himself. It was sent to him in error instead of the person to whom it was intended to be sent. It was sent to no one else. Subsequent to that, the name of the new director became known to museum staff and the press.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bramall: </B>   My Lords, as someone who has worked very closely with the present director, Dr Borg, when he was director-general of the Imperial War Museum--I had the highest opinion of him--does the Minister agree that, whatever interpretation is put on this rather odd sequence of events, it reflects the <P>


<a name="column_1118"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extremely cavalier way in which this very distinguished public servant has been treated by the trustees and, to some extent, by the department?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I certainly agree with the noble and gallant Lord on the distinguished service given by Dr Borg. During his time as the director of the V&A he has overseen a number of successes. Recent highlights include the development of new audiences through critically acclaimed exhibitions such as the art of the Sikh kingdom last year, the introduction of an experimental contemporary programme, the opening of the new Canon photography gallery, the £31 million refurbishment of the British galleries, which will be completed and the galleries reopened by November of this year, along with others. So far as concerns that point, I go along entirely with the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall. However, my answer has made it clear that Dr Borg has not been treated in a cavalier manner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, is not the noble Lord in danger of defending the indefensible here? A great deal of ill feeling, disappointment and hurt have been generated by this series of events. Does the noble Lord agree that, in the circumstances, it would be sensible if Ministers, when appointing chairmen--in this case it was the Prime Minister--were to be careful and to advise the chairmen whom they appoint to behave towards those who serve them in a manner reflecting a high degree of courtesy and concern?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I wholly reject both the implicit and the explicit criticisms made in the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Peyton.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us why it took so long to decide this appointment? Surely the little spat taking place in the Chamber this afternoon might not have taken place had it not been for the fact that it took eight months to reach a decision. Can the Minister confirm whether it was the decision itself or the approval of the decision which took so long?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, no delay occurred in the approval of the decision. The recruitment process was conducted entirely properly. Interviews for the post were held in two stages: the first interviews of seven candidates were conducted in December; second interviews of four of those candidates were conducted in January 2001. This process was carried out after public advertisement of the post and the appointment of recruitment consultants. This is not a quick process, but it is a correct process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I have taken an interest in the process since before the events just described by the Minister because I, too, am a friend of Dr Borg. May I ask how it was that the intention that his contract should not be renewed beyond his 60th birthday <P>


<a name="column_1119"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>became public knowledge so very far in advance of that event? Has this not in fact reduced his ability to run the establishment even more effectively than the noble Lord has already rightly outlined?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, there was no question of Dr Borg's contract of appointment being renewed beyond his 60th birthday. His five-year contract expired in autumn 2000. At that time he was informed that his contract would be extended until January 2002, which would coincide with his 60th birthday. That had to become public knowledge because action had to be taken to recruit his successor.

<A NAME="10227-02_spopq0"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How they will ensure that civil society organisations can monitor and evaluate progress in poverty reduction strategies in the poorest countries.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative (HIPC) makes a direct link between debt relief and poverty reduction. As a result, all countries that are eligible for World Bank or IMF concessional adjustment lending are producing national poverty reduction strategies. These strategies are being developed by national governments in wide consultation with civil society. Progress will be judged through the normal processes of democratic accountability.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   My Lords, I think we all agree that civil society has to be supported and I welcome the emphasis on that in the Government's White Paper. However, these are very large aid and debt relief funds coming into the different countries. How can non-governmental organisations, especially the smaller ones, be expected to be equipped to monitor their government's progress as regards poverty strategies; and how can we expect those governments to tolerate their doing so?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, there are three different initiatives which will assist that process. First, we are mainstreaming work on poverty reduction and the monitoring of governments engaged in poverty reduction strategies through our work with the international financial institutions, governments and civil society. As part of that, we are working on a proposal with the World Bank to develop the capacity of southern civil society to engage governments in budgetary processes so that they will be able to monitor what their governments are doing with the money. We also contribute to the Paris 21 initiative, which aims to co-ordinate work on capacity building for poverty monitoring from a country-led perspective. As part of that, we are building the capacity of civil society to demand and use poverty <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>information. The UN Development Group is producing new country reports focused on international development targets. The aim is to provide key information and indicators. Yesterday, at the international conference on child poverty, the first of the reports--on Tanzania--was launched.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, why has further lending or debt relief been extended to countries such as Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Zambia, which have not satisfied the criteria of economic and political reform?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, Zambia qualified for debt relief under the HIPC initiative in December last year. It secured new IMF/World Bank lending last year following the sale of the copper mine and renewed commitments to privatisation and macro-economic stabilisation. In all HIPC cases, including that of Zambia, debt relief at the decision point is on "flow" terms. That means that it can be suspended if the Government of Zambia fail to maintain an economic programme designed to restore growth and reduce poverty. Zimbabwe is not eligible for HIPC assistance and is not receiving any new lending or debt relief. In August last year, Nigeria entered into a one-year standby agreement with the IMF. This paves the way for a debt rescheduling agreement, not debt reduction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Whitaker: </B>   My Lords, with reference to civil society, how can the Government ensure that northern NGOs do not dominate over southern NGOs, thus further disempowering them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, we have what is called a civil society challenge fund: £11 million pounds has been allocated to the fund in the coming year. The criterion for funding is that UK-based non-profit making groups must have established links with civil society groups overseas. Those links must be more than merely a channel for transferring money; they must demonstrably add value in terms of the activity to be funded. As I mentioned in my reply to the noble Earl, the Paris 21 initiative aims to build the capacity of civil society to demand and use poverty information.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew16"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lichfield: </B>   My Lords, some of the poorest people in the world live under dictatorships. Will the Minister help us in thinking about how such people may be able to participate in programmes of aid and debt relief, which depend on economic reform, good governance and strong civil society?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree that it is difficult to deliver aid which benefits the poor in countries where the government are not committed to poverty reduction. We recognise that, and we have been trying to look at ways in which we can reduce poverty in such difficult circumstances. Debt relief is provided only to countries that have a programme of economic management funded by the IMF. That must be focused on economic growth and poverty <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>reduction. For HIPC countries which are in conflict or which have a governance problem, the Chancellor of the Exchequer pledged that from 1st December last year all debt payments to the UK will be held in trust and will be returned to fund poverty reduction programmes when the country is able to enter the HIPC process.

<A NAME="10227-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, the Minister mentioned democratic accountability. Does she agree that democratic accountability relies on strong opposition? Will the Government provide further funding for organisations such as the Westminster Foundation which promote democratic opposition?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, that it is important to have strong, democratic processes in-country. The Westminster Foundation has made a strong commitment and carried out good work in countries by way of promoting democratic processes. I shall write to the noble Lord with respect to the specific question on funding.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind that these poorest countries have received funds either from governments or from charities in more prosperous countries, can the noble Baroness say to what extent those funds have been fully used for the relief of poverty?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I should tell the noble Lord that in 1997 we made it absolutely clear in our White Paper that our development programme would be totally focused on the international development targets and the relief of poverty. We have been working with the international financial institutions, with the European Union and with others to try to ensure that they adopt a similar attitude in the programmes that they develop. We have been somewhat successful, especially with the EU, and through the HIPC process with the World Bank and the IMF.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, the UK climate change programme that was published last November sets out in detail how we plan to deliver our climate change targets. We estimate that the policies in the programme could reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 23 per cent below 1990 levels by 2010, and our carbon dioxide emissions by 19 per cent. We remain on course to meet these objectives, and we shall continue to evaluate our progress regularly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Is the noble Lord aware that in an independent survey published earlier this month it was estimated that a reduction of CO2 emissions compared with 1990 by the year 2010 would amount to only 6.5 per cent, compared with the 20 per cent targeted, unless further urgent action is taken? Will the noble Lord comment on that estimate? Can the noble Lord also tell the House when the suspended international talks in the Hague are likely to be resumed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I shall deal first with the noble Lord's latter point. At the request of the incoming United States Administration the resumption of these talks, which was scheduled for May, has now been postponed to some time between the middle of June and the end of July. Intensive negotiations are in train to establish that outcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para1"></a>Secondly, the estimate in the study to which the noble Lord referred, which, I believe, relates to Cambridge Econometrics, was based on policies already in train. We do not seriously disagree with that estimate. However, it did not include all of the policies to which this Government are committed. It included only the price effect of the climate change levy, not the effect of the establishment of the carbon trust or of the reaching of agreements with the high-energy user sectors. Moreover, it did not include emissions trading effects, the effects of new building regulations on energy requirements, or the effect of the voluntary agreement between the European car manufacturers on reducing CO2 emissions from transport. There are several other policies to which we are committed at national or European level that will contribute towards achieving the 20 per cent target.

<A NAME="10227-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Palmer: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that if Her Majesty's Government gave full support to a new British bio-diesel industry this would go a long way towards supporting their aims as regards climate change?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, will know, in response to his "green challenge" the Chancellor of the Exchequer is currently considering a number of proposals for favouring alternative fuels. However, the full benefit involved is likely to be felt to the back-end of this period and beyond 2010.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, as the Treasury indicated on Friday, the presumption is that there will not be full availability of ULSP at the time of the Budget and that, therefore, some transitional arrangements have to be engaged in as regards pricing. However, by the end of that transitional period we are confident that ULSP will be available throughout the United Kingdom.

<A NAME="10227-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, in view of the positive relations that we understand have been created between the Prime Minister and the new President of the United States, can the Minister say whether Her Majesty's Government will use every possible opportunity between now and next June to persuade the US of the importance of coming on board with regard to the Kyoto protocol, as they are in many ways the key in reducing the dangers of global warming at the present time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, it is important that we impress upon the new US Administration the importance that we in the United Kingdom--and, indeed, in Europe--place on reaching agreement on climate change. There was a lengthy and positive discussion between the Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State Powell a few days ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Carver: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the most effective way of reducing our CO emissions would be to build some more nuclear power stations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the target takes into account a reduction in the contributions made by nuclear power for the period to 2010. Beyond that, some assessment of the various sources of energy will need to be made in order to sustain the reduction in CO2 emissions that we are confident of achieving by 2010.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, although I accept the Government's wish to achieve their objectives, can the noble Lord comment on the whole position of the climate change levy, especially on horticulture? I realise that the Government have already given a 50 per cent reduction, but this obviously places those concerned at a disadvantage as regards their overseas competitors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the position of the horticultural industry was addressed by the 50 per cent reduction in the effect. We believe that the kind of competitive anxieties expressed by the industry at that time have largely been met. We recognise that the climate change levy will impose some costs on several sectors in industry. The high-energy users are, of course, now subject to discussion and conclusion of sector agreements. We believe that the anxieties of the <P>

<A NAME="10227-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Lord Macdonald of Tradeston) </B>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 1st February be approved [6th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we are here today to consider a draft order that it is proposed to make under Section 51(2) of the Transport Act 2000. Under Section 103(6), a draft of the order must be laid before and approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. As your Lordships will no doubt be aware, the draft has already been approved in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para3"></a>Those of your Lordships who took part in the many debates on Part I of the Transport Act 2000 will no doubt recall that Parliament took some time to persuade itself of the benefits of the provisions that it contains, which relate to air traffic services. However, Parliament did give its approval and in doing so gave government the authority in principle to proceed with the establishment of the public private partnership (PPP) for National Air Traffic Services Limited.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para4"></a>Noble Lords will also recall that the Government accepted amendments to defer the final stages of the preparations for the PPP for a period of three months after Royal Assent. We agreed to use that period for further discussion with stakeholders, not to re-open the principle of the PPP but to ensure that progress was as smooth as possible and addressed the many legitimate concerns that have been expressed. I undertook that at the end of that period I would come back to your Lordships' House and provide a further opportunity for debating the issues. I am happy to confirm that we shall honour that commitment in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para5"></a>That debate will no doubt provide the opportunity for noble Lords to raise many aspects of this subject. Today's business is much narrower and more technical. In passing the Transport Act, Parliament was clear that it wanted the PPP to proceed hand in hand with a number of safeguards. The instrument that we are considering today is intended to give effect to those protections.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para6"></a>The draft order itself is a relatively simple document. It seeks to designate, for the purposes of Section 51 of the Act, a company named National Air Traffic Services (No 2) Ltd, which, for convenience, I shall call "NATS No 2". This company is a government-owned company that has been established for the purposes of holding the Secretary of State's shares in National Air Traffic Services Limited (NATS). It will be the vehicle for the NATS Public <P>


<a name="column_1125"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Private Partnership (PPP)--in other words, 46 per cent of the company's shareholding will be sold to the strategic partner; 5 per cent will be made available to employees and the Government will retain a 49 per cent stake.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para7"></a>For a company to be designated under this section, it must be in receipt of assets under a transfer scheme made under Section 43 of the Act. The shares in NATS, which are currently owned by the Civil Aviation Authority, are to be transferred to NATS No. 2 under a transfer scheme to be made on 31st March, the date on which it is proposed this order will come into effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para8"></a>A further requirement relates to public ownership of the transferee company. NATS No. 2 will meet this requirement, as at the time of the transfer it will continue to be wholly owned by the Government. I hope that that provides your Lordships with an explanation of the technical side of the order. I will now deal in a little more detail with its effects.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para9"></a>The designation of the company will apply the various protections in Section 51 to NATS No. 2, and I will look at each of these in turn. The first protection is one that was widely welcomed when it was first proposed. The Secretary of State must ensure that he does not dispose of any shares in NATS No. 2 unless he is satisfied that a scheme is in place to ensure the completion of major projects relating to the provision of air traffic services. The projects falling within this category are the New Scottish Centre at Prestwick and the New En Route Centre at Swanwick. Designation of the company will ensure that the Government's commitment to complete these projects will be honoured.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para10"></a>There are also further protections relating to the limits of the Government's shareholding in the PPP. They come in two forms--one relates to the Government's ability to sell shares and the other to what the Government may allow to happen to their shareholding in a situation where new shares are being issued, for example to fund a capital investment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para11"></a>I will start with the Government's ability to sell shares. Any sale of shares in the designated company must not reduce the Crown's shareholding in that company below 49 per cent. As I have already explained, the Government do indeed intend to retain a 49 per cent stake. This level of government shareholding reflects the ongoing public interest in NATS, which we believe is essential for the future of the provision of air traffic services in this country. It will ensure that the taxpayer gets value for money, and the taxpayer will share in any dividends. Again, the introduction of these protections was widely welcomed in Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para12"></a>The second type of protection (enshrined in subsection (5) of Section 51) relates to a situation where, for whatever reason, the Government agreed with the chosen strategic partner that new shares should be issued, for example so as to allow a major capital investment or project to go ahead. In that case, there is a protection as to the minimum level of government shareholding; namely, that the Secretary <P>


<a name="column_1126"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of State is required to hold at least 25 per cent of the designated company's share capital at any given time. This limit has given rise to much discussion in previous debates. I am aware that concerns have been expressed that this limit gives the Government a free hand to reduce their shareholding, and consequently is a stepping stone to full privatisation. We dealt fully with those matters when the Bill was being considered, but I can again reassure your Lordships that this is not the case. The protections we have allow the Government only to sell 51 per cent of the shares in NATS--with the fall-back that if, at some time in the future, the Government were to agree to new shares being issued, they must not allow the effect of this to be that the Crown owns less than 25 per cent of the larger pool of shares. These are important protections and reassurances of the continuing role for the Government in this PPP.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para13"></a>The next protection contained in this order is that the Secretary of State must continue to hold a special share in the designated company. That requirement will be entrenched in the company's articles of association and will, along with the shareholders' agreement, be used to protect the Government's rights in certain key areas such as the issue of new shares and the company's dividend policy. In essence, it will enable the Government to maintain the public interest while allowing the private sector the freedom to run the business.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para14"></a>Noble Lords on the Benches opposite attached importance to the special share during our debates on the Bill for the protection it would afford for national security. They were quite right to do so. They also suggested that the European Commission might challenge the special share. However, the Government remain firmly of the view that our powers to hold such a share are robust in this case.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para15"></a>The final protection is that the company's articles of association must not be amended without the Secretary of State's consent. However, the Secretary of State cannot consent to any such alteration unless a statement of the proposed consent is approved by both Houses of Parliament. This is intended as a safeguard to ensure that the Secretary of State would not be able to consent, without parliamentary approval, to a reduction in the rights attaching to the special share.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para16"></a>I hope that I have explained to your Lordships with sufficient clarity the protections that this very short order will introduce. In passing the Transport Act, Parliament has given its approval to the Government's proposal to establish the PPP, subject to certain safeguards. I trust that your Lordships will now endorse this technical measure to give them effect. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the order, which, as he said, is not in itself controversial, dealing, as he <P>


<a name="column_1127"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>explained, with the setting up of NATS No. 2 Ltd, as I suppose we must now get used to calling it. Indeed, I welcome the protections that the order gives to the special share and other measures. However, it also gives us the opportunity to question the Minister on the selection of the strategic partner for NATS No. 2.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para18"></a>Like no doubt other noble Lords, I have seen press reports of the progress, or rather lack of it, of choosing the preferred bidder for the PPP. Last week it was reported in the press that the Government had abandoned plans to select a preferred bidder. What does that mean? Originally the timetable was for the preferred bidder to be announced by the end of February; that is, tomorrow. What does it mean that there is now to be no preferred bidder? Further, press reports yesterday stated that one of the key partners of SERCO, one of the bidders, had pulled out under pressure from members of the airline group, another bidder. I hope that the Minister can clarify exactly what is going on and what now is the timetable for a decision and, indeed, how many runners are still in the frame.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para19"></a>I remind the Minister--the Minister has already referred to this--of the amendment that we made in this House that called for a three-month delay to any transfer and the undertaking from the Minister to make a report at the end of that time. Those three months were supposed to give the Government, among other things, time to select the strategic partner and announce it. That clearly will not now happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para20"></a>Whoever the bidder is, it is clear that safety must come first. I am sure that we are all agreed upon that. Can the Minister say what the views of the aviation safety group of the Civil Aviation Authority are? Is it true that it has serious doubts about at least one of the potential bidders? If that is so, will the Government not hesitate to take a lower bid for the sake of a safer bidder? Does the Minister want to take the opportunity now to revise downward the likely proceeds of the part sale from the figure of £350 million which was originally announced? Is it true that the Secretary of State only agreed to the PPP on the promise from the Chancellor that he could spend the proceeds on transport? Does the Minister now wonder whether that was in fact a worthwhile trade-off?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para21"></a>There are two other matters. First, when NATS No. 2 goes into the PPP will there be any mechanism for a clawback of any excess profits made by the strategic partner? In previous privatisations the Government were criticised for not having made such an arrangement. Secondly, I am puzzled as to the status of the employees' 5 per cent shareholding. When this order was discussed in another place the Minister stated that,
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-03_para23"></a>If the employees cannot trade their shares and have to return them when they retire, and if they do not receive any dividends, which I presume would be the case if the not-for-profit partner was chosen, then what <P>


<a name="column_1128"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>value is there to the employees' shareholding at all? I hope that the Minister can answer some of these questions today and that he can tell us when the fuller statement and report will be made and the form that it will take. The Minister has already referred to this and he said "in due course". Can the Minister be a little more specific it than that?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, I believe that everyone agrees with the Minister that this order is not of itself of any great debatable value, but simply implements the Bill. I do not propose to go back on all the arguments that we have had. Neither do I believe that it would be very profitable to try to seek a great deal of detailed information about each of the bids. Efforts were made in Standing Committee in the other place, but achieved very little result. I shall not follow that line.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para0"></a>However, I support and add my queries to the questions put by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara. They are extremely relevant and pertinent questions. We all look forward to a full answer from the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para1"></a>As the noble Lord said, there have been suggestions in the press that one or other of the three bidders left is no longer a favoured bidder. However, reports vary as to who that might be. Can the Minister tell the House whether they are still three, two or only one bidder? In the final resort I do not expect the Minister to tell us who it is because he has already said that when matters reach that stage he will return to the House. If there are only two bidders left perhaps he will be able to tell us their names. That will also help to concentrate our minds.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para2"></a>There is the question of the timetable. There is the mythical or magical date of 31st March. At some point there will be a debate in this House, which the Minister has confirmed. At the same time we are expecting the announcement of a preferred bidder. So at what point in the subsequent process will we have the debate? Shall we have it between the announcement of the name of the preferred bidder and the final signing of the contract or shall we not be able to discuss the matter until the contract has been signed?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para3"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, said, there are legitimate concerns about the safety aspects of the bid. I am sure that I do not need to remind the Minister of the amendment to the Bill which gave priority to the Secretary of State's duty to maintain a high standard of safety and the identical provision relating to the CAA and everything that it does as regards NATS. I do not in the least doubt the Secretary of State's commitment, but I would like to be assured that the Treasury is also under the same limitation, or is there a conflict between the requirement on the Secretary of State to put safety first in everything that he does and the natural tendency of the Treasury in these circumstances to wish to allocate the contract to the lowest bidder?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para4"></a>I hope that we shall receive a little more clarification about employee shares. As I understand it, any current employee of NATS will have to sell back, give back or <P>


<a name="column_1129"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>get rid of their allocation of shares on leaving the company. However, that 5 per cent was a percentage of the total shareholding. One can appreciate that if each new employee were given a shareholding its amount would increase. But what if the number of shares in the company is increased? Does that automatically result in an increase in the number of shares allocated to the employees? At that point which employees are we talking about; those who were engaged at the beginning of the company or those in current employment?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para5"></a>Finally, as regards the special share, in this House and in another place we have received frequent reassurances, almost in the same words, that the share is robust. I ask the Minister to tell the House on what evidence the assurance of robustness is based? Have the Government been to the Commission and actually discussed the validity and the sound legal basis for the share before coming to this House and to the other place to reassure Parliament about the robustness of the share?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, once again, the NATS PPP has provided us with a topical and interesting debate. I am grateful for the contributions that have been made, which have ensured that these very important matters relating to the PPP have been aired once more. Following this debate, I am sure that your Lordships will be aware of the importance of the issues that this order raises. The Government continue to believe that it provides some essential protection that will contribute to the success of the PPP.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para6"></a>I now deal with some of the particular points that have been made. As regards the identity of the bidders, the Government have received and evaluated three bids for the NATS PPP, as scheduled. The Government's objective remains to implement the PPP in the spring. The Government have not selected one preferred bidder at this stage, but they are in continuing discussions with the Nimbus consortium and the Airline Group. The third bidder, Novares, has not been eliminated from the process, but is being held in reserve. We expect the preferred bidder to be selected within the next month. We shall try to ensure that we drive that timetable through on time and that the PPP will come into effect as soon as possible thereafter.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, asked about the agenda that we are working to as regards the delay period when we promised to hold discussions with the trade unions, the users, pension trustees and other stakeholders about the process for establishing the PPP. We have been doing that. Recently, we had the latest in a series of constructive meeting with the unions. We met representatives of the users, including General Aviation interests, last month, and we are in continuing dialogue with the pension trustees. We have received written comments from a range of other interested parties. My honourable friend, the Parliamentary Secretary in another place, and his predecessor, have both been to see the NATS operation at the London Centre at West Drayton at <P>


<a name="column_1130"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>first hand. He and I have been to Swanwick to see the new en-route centre. At both locations we took the opportunity to have discussions with staff as well as with managers. I believe, therefore, that the discussion process is constructive. It will help, as has been suggested by noble Lords opposite, to ensure a smooth transition to the PPP. As promised, I shall make a full report to the House in due course. Noble Lords may recall that I said that we will report back by the end of February or early March.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para8"></a>As regards other questions which were raised and the clawback arrangements, the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon inquired whether the Government would be introducing such arrangements and how they would be consistent with the partner's incentive to increase NATS business. The PPP is structured to protect the taxpayer against an early sale of the assets leading to excessive profits, first, by retaining a 49 per cent equity stake in NATS. The taxpayer will share in the potential upside benefits created through the introduction of a strategic partner. Secondly, the strategic partnership agreement does not allow the partner to exit until the new Scottish centre is complete. That is presently scheduled to be around the year 2007. That would prevent a quick and profitable sale.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para9"></a>One of the Government's primary objective for the PPP has been to select a partner who will be committed to NATS for the long term. The Government believe that the PPP's structure will provide the right incentives for the partner to grow and develop NATS business while providing the appropriate protection for the taxpayer against excessive profits and windfall gains.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para10"></a>Another question was raised about the status of the opinion supposedly expressed by safety experts. I understand that the safety experts cited in one newspaper article were acting in an advisory capacity to the chairman of NATS and were not formally connected with the Civil Aviation Authority. I am sure that any concerns will be fed into the bidding process through the office of the chairman of NATS.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para11"></a>I was also asked about the relative priorities of the Treasury and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. I assure noble Lords that those imperatives are in close alignment and there is no threat that different priorities might put safety at risk. As your Lordships ensured in your amendment to the Transport Bill in its final stages, safety is paramount. That now has the force of legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para12"></a>We are still in discussions about the arrangements for the 5 per cent of equity that will go to employees. It will depend on the nature of the equity structures of the successful bidder, whoever that is. If other relevant details emerge, I shall write to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and to the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, as soon as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para13"></a>We believe that the special share is robust. It is only one part of a comprehensive range of safeguards. We believe that we have taken appropriate advice and that the special share proposals are consistent with the UK's obligations under the Treaty of Rome. Should <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>any different interpretation emerge--although none has in all our discussions--I shall tell the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-04_para14"></a>I hope that I have responded to the most important points made in the debate. The debate has not been about the principle of the PPP. Parliament has already given its blessing to the Government's proposals to create a PPP by approving the necessary powers in the Transport Act 2000. The real subject of the debate is the activation of the safeguards that Parliament wanted. I invite your Lordships to approve the order.

<A NAME="10227-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   My Lords, the Minister did not answer the point made by my noble friend Lady Thomas on what stage will be reached before he reports back to the House. Can we have a clear undertaking that he will report back to the House before entering into any binding commitment with a so-called preferred bidder--a commitment that could lay the taxpayer open to substantial damages? If he is not prepared to give that commitment, surely it makes a mockery of the reporting back process. Can we have a clear answer on that, please?

<A NAME="10227-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, let me be clear. The relationship of the report back was never for an approval of the bidder. If the noble Lord checks what I said in the debate, he will find that that is clear. We said that we would undertake the process that the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, strongly encouraged to try to spread a broader understanding of what we were trying to achieve and to give the Government time to listen and make any amendments that might be beneficial to the operation of the PPP as we went forward. We are doing that. Were the timing to be such that the selection of a preferred bidder came before my report back, of course I would welcome that, but it has never been conditional.

<A NAME = "10227-05_para7"></a>Some groups of casual and self-employed workers advertise their services in newspapers and shop windows quoting only a telephone number. They include window cleaners, gardeners, hairdressers and builders. I am mindful that, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, says, if I keep referring to window cleaners, there will not be any left in the country, so I have tried to find others with similarly erratic modes of employment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para8"></a>By advertising by telephone number only, such people are able to evade inquiries under existing powers. We have no way of identifying them. We do not have the power to ask a telecommunications provider to tell us who owns a particular telephone number, yet we know from the evidence that we have picked up that quite a high proportion of those people are likely to be committing some form of benefit fraud.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para9"></a>Amendment No. 16 would allow us to do that. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Grabiner, who first highlighted the value of obtaining such information in his report on the informal economy. In chapter 5, he said that giving fraud investigators the right to reverse search telephone number databases would be a valuable extension of their powers. It would be a valuable tool for Inland Revenue investigators in particular, who would be able to follow up advertisements for goods and services that gave a contact number but no personal details, for example in local newspapers and newsagents. They could check whether a person who subscribed to a given number was registered for tax or was claiming benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para10"></a>We are not talking about fishing trips. We would still need reasonable grounds for making the inquiries. Although the provisions in new Section 2C would not apply to the amendment, the provisions that already govern inquiries to employers would still apply. The provisions would be inserted in Section 109B of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which provides that the powers may be used only when it is reasonable in relation to explicitly set out purposes, which can cover whether the benefit is paid, investigating and detecting benefit offences and contravening social security legislation. The Bill would not allow us to check a telephone number simply because it appeared in an advertisement. It would have to be an advertisement for a service that is at risk of <P>


<a name="column_1133"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fraud. To establish that, we would consider the issues that I mentioned earlier, such as seasonal factors or whether the service provides opportunities to nip out and sign on.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para11"></a>I emphasise that the powers would not allow us to obtain information on the content of communications. They are only reverse search powers to establish the name of the owner of the phone number. Obtaining information on the content of communications would be very intrusive and would not be reasonable, although, given the changing nature of the communications world and the sensitivities around the content of communications, we thought that it would be inappropriate to rely only on the test of reasonableness.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para12"></a>We wish to make it unequivocally clear that the powers could never be used to obtain information about the content of a communication. Amendment No. 15 would achieve that by limiting us to communications data, except for traffic data. I hope that your Lordships will recognise that we are honourably limiting the point to which the powers can be taken. I refer noble Lords to Section 21(4) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, in which the definition of "communications data" contains the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"which includes none of the contents of a communication".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-05_para13"></a>
The other amendments--Amendments Nos. 20 and 21--tidy up the references in the Bill to telecommunications.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para14"></a>In conclusion, these amendments will enable us to obtain the identity of persons who advertise their services by telephone. That will enable us to detect and prevent people working and claiming benefit, which constitutes the largest area of fraud. The powers could be used only where we had reasonable grounds. They are akin to the powers which we already have to obtain information from employers. They could not be used to obtain information about the content of telephone calls or about the person to whom a call is made. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will welcome the amendments, which, as I say, are strictly circumscribed. I beg to move.

<A NAME="10227-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches are grateful to the noble Baroness for explaining so clearly this group of amendments. We welcome the amendments, which tidy up the definition of the telecommunications services. We believe them to be practical and useful. However, we wonder whether the Government's zeal for clarity has made the insertion of new subsection (2F) somewhat redundant, given that the phrase "communications data but not traffic data" in new subsection (2E) would in any case provide for new subsection (2F). This is not an important point, but I mention it in passing.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para15"></a>We are pleased that the definition has made it clear that only communications data and not traffic data are to be requested by the DSS for its inquiries.

<A NAME = "10227-05_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever. As your Lordships will see, the amendment seeks to eliminate from the list of people from whom the Government can ask for information,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-05_para21"></a>
We had a brief discussion about this in Committee. As on previous occasions, the noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, was extremely helpful in providing us with definitions of what "servants" or "agents" might be. Indeed, in subsequent correspondence, the noble Baroness gave rather more pedantic definitions which, none the less, are helpful. We are grateful to her for those.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para22"></a>I believe that it may be helpful if at this stage in the proceedings I say a word or two about the other extremely helpful action which the noble Baroness has taken; namely, to provide the House not only with an amendment which incorporates into the Bill the code of practice which will govern many of these clauses but also a draft of the code itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para23"></a>We shall come to a later amendment on which we shall be able to debate the code of practice. However, it may be helpful to refer to it at various points during the course of our deliberations this afternoon. I certainly do not intend to weary the House by referring to it both on an amendment to which it is relevant and when we come to debate the code as a whole, but I believe that it will be helpful to proceed in that way.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para24"></a>So far as concerns this amendment, paragraph 4.4 on pages 12 and 13 of the code of practice deals with this particular point. It is a question not only of whether it is appropriate for the Government to be able to ask the principal involved in any transaction for information about an individual who is suspected of fraud but also whether it is appropriate for them to ask for such information from the person's servant or agent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para25"></a>The only reason that I return to this point at this stage is that I am a little puzzled as to what in practice the Government have in mind. The code of practice states that authorised officers should only address inquiries to an individual directly--that is, to either a servant or an agent--where it is not possible to identify the corporate body. I am not sure whether the officers are clear as to who the corporate body is, how they will know who the agent is or, in particular, who the servant is. If they are clear that the person in question is a servant, presumably they must know who employs that person.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-05_para26"></a>In a helpful letter the noble Baroness said that the person may be an agent; for example, a newsagent may deal with money transactions and would be the agent of another financial organisation. However, again, I should have thought that it would be possible simply to return to the principal. I have a vague feeling at the back of my mind that, given that presumably a relationship of confidentiality exists between the agent and the principal, it would be undesirable for the Government to go to the individual concerned. Certainly, so far as concerns employees, if an employee were being awkward in not providing information, it would seem very odd for the Government to take action against him directly rather than against the company, which they can in any case ask to provide the information. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Grabiner: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may raise one matter in direct response to one of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. Sometimes it is not possible to detect whether or not a business is a corporate person. A partnership is not a corporate body in English law. Almost certainly a local newsagent is not a corporate body; it is a one-person business. I believe that in a case of that kind, not only may it not be possible to identify the corporate body but a corporate body may simply not exist. Therefore, one can only talk to someone who may be the principal of the business or who may be an agent or servant of the principal.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para0"></a>Thus, the corner newsagent may simply operate under the rubric of a personal business without having any corporate structure. He may have an employee who works in the shop. That person will be an employee or agent for the purposes of the type of inquiry which we are now discussing. I suggest that that would be an appropriate case to come within the language of the paragraph of the code of practice to which the noble Lord drew attention a moment ago.
<P>


<a name="column_1136"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para1"></a>In a case where the corporate body exists and can be identified, then, according to the draft of the code, in most circumstances it would not be appropriate to approach the individual; it would be appropriate to go direct to the corporate body.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I could, if noble Lords wish, present a full argument about the amendment. However, in an effort to save time I shall home in on the concerns that were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and add to the helpful points that were made by my noble friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para2"></a>The code states that we shall address an inquiry to an individual only when we cannot identify a corporate body. The noble Lord asked about the circumstances in which that would be the case. Some possibilities were outlined by my noble friend, but I shall give a couple of examples that may clarify the situation with regard to possible servants and possible agents. We will need to address a request for information to a servant only when we cannot identify a corporation to which to address the inquiry. For example, a language school operating in the UK may be a small part of a large international organisation and we may have difficulty establishing the legal identity of the UK part of the organisation. If the language school could not or would not provide sufficient information to enable us to address our inquiry to the corporate body, we should address it to the most senior appropriate person in the language school, such as the head of the school in the UK.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para3"></a>In another example, we may want to obtain information from a cheque shop because we believe that a claimant is cashing girocheques but reporting them as stolen. If the cheque shop was not a limited company--this point was made by my noble friend--there would be no corporate body to which to address the inquiry. If the staff in the cheque shop could not or would not provide sufficient information to enable us to identify the person carrying out the business, we would have to address the inquiry to the most senior appropriate person in the cheque shop, such as the manager. One could complicate the example further by suggesting that the manager might tell us that the owner of the company lived abroad.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para4"></a>Similar provisions apply to agents. For example, a large university might contract out its record-keeping duties to a commercial data management company and ask us to direct our inquiries about whether a claimant was one of its students to that company. The data management company would be the university's agent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para5"></a>I could give other examples but the significant point is that we should go to an individual only when we cannot identify a corporate body. We do not expect that to happen often; it usually happens when complicated histories are associated with an organisation, perhaps because the owners are abroad or responsibilities have been delegated to a body to act as its agent. In such cases, it would be helpful to have those powers. The issue has been raised in discussions <P>


<a name="column_1137"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on the draft code of practice between business representatives and officials. Businesses generally want corporate liability rather than liability for individual employers and we are confident that our provisions will meet their concerns in that regard. We are happy to continue talking and if we need to strengthen the draft code in that respect, we should be happy to look at the matter. In the light of that, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment, which stands in my name and that of my noble friend, is, in a way, the mirror image of Amendment No. 4. Amendment No. 3 relates to the way in which the department or local authorities will make inquiries of the kind that are described in the Bill. There is a strong case throughout for that being done through a centralised system rather than through a system that allows an authorised person to make a request for information from a bank or other body. Amendment No. 4 relates to what happens at the receiving end of the request, although it is helpful to consider Amendment Nos. 3 and 4 separately.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para9"></a>The provisions in the code of practice relating to structure are helpful in several respects. As we proceed, it may be helpful to try to establish how the code will operate. Paragraph 1.4 of the code, for example, states that people asking for information will be trained and will work either in one of the department's area intelligence units or in the national intelligence unit. I take that to mean that inquires will come from those working in the area intelligence unit or the national intelligence unit. If so, the point that we seek to establish in the amendment--there was some confusion about drafting at an earlier stage of the Bill's passage through the House--would not be pressing. I hope that the Minister will give an assurance that all inquiries will be made, as the draft code states in paragraph 1.4, through the area intelligence unit or the national intelligence unit.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para10"></a>Paragraph 4.19 states that all inquiries will be conducted through centralised intelligence units--I emphasise that that is in the plural. If I understand the situation correctly, the system will be centralised only to the extent that a request comes through a series of units rather than from a single unit. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para11"></a>Another point arises in relation to paragraph 4.3, which sets out the information that may be asked for. It seems to suggest that, although the request for information will be made through a relatively--<P>


<a name="column_1138"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perhaps completely--centralised system, there may be a request to send the information back to a more diffused position, from which the inquiry originated. Later we shall discuss questions arising from the rather complicated structure that the Government seem to have in mind for the relationship between the various classes of official. At this stage, is it the intention that, even though a request has been channelled through a centralised organisation, it may be asked of a request, "Please send back the reply"--that is implied in paragraph 4.3--and that that should be sent to the individual who asked for the information in the first place? If that is the situation, it raises questions that we need to consider. Requests should come from the centralised system and the reply should be channelled back through the same system. When one views together the two paragraphs to which I referred, it is not clear whether that is the Government's intention. It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify exactly what the Government have in mind. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I can be relatively brief. The code will be statutory and inquiries can come from only the 14 central points--there is one point in each of our 13 area directorates and one in our national intelligence unit. I confirm the noble Lord's expectations. The provision is in the code, which is statutory, and its provisions will be binding. Business need have no concerns about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-06_para12"></a>The address to which the request will be sent back will be that from which it was sent. In other words, it will be sent back to one of the 14 units. We may need to clarify the wording in the code to make it clear that that is our intention. With those assurances, I hope that the noble Lord feels able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, the Minister is probably right; perhaps we should look at the second of the two paragraphs to which I referred. It gives the impression that replies may go back in a way that is different from that through which it was received. It was good of the Minister to provide the code in the first place. It will be helpful to pick up various points as we proceed, and although doing so may delay our proceedings a little, I hope that it will not do so by very much. No doubt later there will be wide-ranging consultations. The sooner that one picks up points, the earlier they can be corrected. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>in some shotgun way to some given organisation--for example, a bank--or whether they will be concentrated on a single point.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para1"></a>This matter was discussed briefly in Committee and the Government were able to say that it will be possible for it to be done through a single part of the organisation from whom the information is being requested. We see again in paragraphs 422 and 423 of the code of practice that that will be done. The noble Baroness pointed out that my original amendment would have been too restrictive; it could only have been done through a single access point. However, she has fulfilled what she said in Committee and the code reflects that. However, perhaps she will once again confirm it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to give that confirmation. I agree with the noble Lord that it is helpful to cross-read amendments against the draft code in order to clarify any possible misunderstandings. We will go to the point to which businesses wish us to go, which will normally be a central department. That is what many organisations request when dealing with the police. Where an organisation does not wish to set up a central point--for example, a school--which may be too elaborate when dealing with a very occasional inquiry, we shall not force them to do so. Were this amendment to be carried, as the noble Lord admitted, the British Bankers' Association said that its effect would be to make the workings potentially inflexible.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para2"></a>I am happy to give the assurances that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, seeks. We are working very positively with businesses to that effect.

<A NAME = "10227-07_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 5, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 8 and 13 and the grouped amendments that stand in my name. They refer to the circumstances in which authorised officers may obtain information--new subsections (2B) and (2C).
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para6"></a>My noble friend Lord Grabiner led an extremely helpful debate on these provisions in Committee. During that debate concerns were expressed in the Chamber about the implications of these "unamended" phrases. Your Lordships expressed two concerns. The first was on the provisions to obtain information on persons falling within groups who are more likely than others to commit fraud. The second concern--particularly identified by the noble Earl, Lord Russell--was the concept of obtaining <P>


<a name="column_1140"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information on an individual who "is likely to" contravene social security legislation or commit a benefit offence. I agreed to consider how we could address those concerns.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para7"></a>Amendment No. 8 is the substantive amendment. It is a rather elegant piece of drafting. On the first of your Lordships' concerns, the amendment removes the provision regarding those in groups more likely than others to commit fraud--the old Section (2C)(c) which now goes. During Committee, I explained that through research we are finding out the characteristics of those people who commit fraud. I took heed of your Lordships' views. We felt that, given the reverse search of the telephone directories--the first amendment that we discussed today--some of our concerns about groups of people that we may wish to pursue (for example, tree fellers) can be met without the possible infringements that subsection (2C) might have opened up. We felt that we could meet the concern of the House and remove subsection (2C)(c).
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para8"></a>I turn to the second area of concern and the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, which replaces the words, "is likely to" with the words, "intended to". I agreed to consider that amendment. As I indicated in Committee, the words "is likely to" were meant to cover circumstances where fraud was intended because we believe it is better to prevent fraud rather than to let it into the system and then have to set about detecting it. I accepted that the words "is likely to" had a more common meaning which might be unacceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para9"></a>The suggestions of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, more or less retain the policy intention while addressing the concerns expressed by the House. Consequently, with the addition of the present tense to the provision--"is committing"--I have returned with an amendment along the lines suggested by the noble Earl. I decided that the suggestion regarding provisions relating to contraventions of social security legislation was in line with our policy intention. I felt that the fact that we could remove those provisions relating to contravention because they were subsumed in the broader category was in line with those statements.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para10"></a>Finally, I was able to go beyond what we agreed in Committee because, in talking subsequently with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, I was asked to consider removing the words "or may be" from the test of reasonableness that an authorised officer has to satisfy when considering whether or not to make an inquiry. Thus, an authorised officer would only be able to make an inquiry if it appeared to him that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person "is" a person, as opposed to "may be", who has committed, is committing or intends to commit a benefit offence. It represents a slightly higher test of reasonableness for authorised officers to attain.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para11"></a>That would be sensible and prudent in the light of some of the concerns expressed by your Lordships that there could be ultimately the potential for abuse despite our checks. As a result of that, I accepted the suggestion that we should remove the words--"or may be"--thus tightening the clause even more.

<A NAME = "10227-07_para12"></a>Amendments Nos. 5 and 13 are consequential. So I hope that your Lordships will agree that the Government have listened to the concerns expressed--led by my noble friend Lord Grabiner in Committee--and, as promised, I have brought forward amendments not only to address those concerns but to go slightly further than I promised. I shall be deeply upset if your Lordships feel unable to support my amendments today. I beg to move.

<A NAME="10227-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, the Minister and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, on a previous occasion--although not for some years--have heard me quote a dictum by the late Iain Macleod that we do not shoot Santa Claus. What he meant was that, if one had a concession from a government in response to representations, one did not then proceed to make a speech for three hours saying what it was all about in the first place. I intend to follow that practice. I learnt my trade at his feet and it always seemed a good dictum.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para13"></a>The Minister has fulfilled the commitment she gave in Committee to consider this matter, both with regard to the objectionable word "likely" and the extremely objectionable part in relation to groups of persons said to be in danger of committing fraud, even window cleaners. The noble Baroness met both those points admirably. I agree that the amendment is elegantly drafted. We are pleased that these amendments have been moved. It is entirely appropriate to leave unasked how the second of them ever entered the Bill in the first place. None the less, it is a great improvement and we are grateful for it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-07_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, we have here a model of the way Parliament ought to work--it sometimes does, and it is nice when it happens. I do not think that the Minister expected to be disappointed in this quarter. The Minister will have observed that I put my name to her amendments. The only reason why I have not put my name to the amendments from the noble Lords, Lord Higgins and Lord Astor of Hever--to which I had my name at the previous stage--is that the Minister's amendments have now rendered them redundant.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para14"></a>I thank noble Lords for what has come about; the Minister for master-minding the whole thing and for seeing an opportunity and taking it. The noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, offered more helpful contributions than we are ever likely to know. My noble friend Lord Goodhart makes me rather pleased I was not able to be present previously because he saw an opportunity and took it with his consummate skill. He produced a great improvement as a result. I thank the Minister's officials. We have a model of proceedings as envisaged in the committees chaired by the noble Earl, Lord Jellicoe, and Lord Rippon of Hexham in which a great deal of the work is done before we come into the Chamber. That work is vital. They played a vital part in it and the Bill is very much improved as a result. I welcome it.

<A NAME="10227-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever </B>   moved Amendment No. 5A:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 29, at end insert ("and shall be exercisable only if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the information is likely to be of substantial value (whether by itself or together with other material) to the inquiry and does not consist of or include items subject to legal privilege").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-07_para16"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 5A, with the leave of the House I shall speak also to the consequential Amendment No. 20A.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para18"></a>Amendment No. 5A ensures that an authorised officer can only require information which is likely to be of substantial value to the inquiry, and does not consist of items subject to legal privilege. Sufficient safeguards should be put in place to ensure that the new powers are proportionate to the intended outcome. Amendment No. 5A recognises the importance of an individual's right to privacy by ensuring that information will only be disclosed in circumstances where the information sought will be of substantial value to the investigation and does not consist of or include items which are subject to legal professional privilege. That will ensure that the same criteria as must be fulfilled before a court will grant production orders under other measures, will apply before a notice can be issued.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-07_para19"></a>Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights enshrines the right to privacy. The law has shown a willingness to acknowledge that right through, inter alia, the doctrine of legal, professional privilege. To preserve that doctrine and ensure that communications between a solicitor and client are privileged, provision should be made on the face of the Bill to the effect that the power to require information under these provisions will not extend to disclosure of information subject to legal privilege. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-08_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, these amendments cover similar ground to Amendments Nos. 17 to 19 tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Goodhart.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para0"></a>The underlying issue here is that of privilege; under what circumstances privilege may justify the withholding of information and under what circumstances, without any government recognition that it so justifies, it may nevertheless be allowed quietly to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para1"></a>People need professional advice of many kinds. That is not always recognised in law. For example, there is, I believe, no legal privilege attaching to confession to a Roman Catholic confessor. Yet I cannot in all my political experience recall a case of a confessor being subpoenaed to give evidence on the confessions of his penitent. Were such a case ever to arise, I might be found here standing shoulder to shoulder with Cardinal Winning in defence of the liberties of the Church. While that may be of great entertainment to the House, I doubt it would be quite so entertaining to the Minister. So if the Minister could indicate whether or not there are some cases where a government may be prepared to hold its hand--such indication of the most imprecise kind, as is the nature of the case--it may assist us.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para2"></a>However, the question arises whether, as one is entitled to take advice from a lawyer with privilege, one may be entitled to take advice under some circumstances from a financial expert with perhaps some qualified form of privilege. The way the financial services industry is developing now, the boundary between those two categories is not quite as definite as it used to be. Where exactly the boundary comes between a tax lawyer and a tax adviser is something on which I do not believe there is any clear legal ruling. People even of the greatest innocence--in fact, most often people of the greatest innocence--may wish to ask their financial adviser, "Am I legally entitled to do this or will I be accidentally evading some obligation to which I am subject?"
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para3"></a>I am sure very few of us are aware of all the obligations to which we are subject. We try, but success is not particularly common. So were we to discourage people from taking expert advice, we might, as with being faced with litigants in person in court, be letting ourselves in for a great deal of extra work.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para4"></a>A problem certainly exists. I do not pretend to see my way through it to a solution, but were we by any miracle able to bring to it the same sort of constructive thought we brought to the last group of amendments, we might possibly do some good.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, Amendments Nos. 5A, 17, 18, 19 and 20A, all seek to place restrictions on the types and sources of information available to authorised officers. They seek to prevent us adding people that provide advice or professional assistance to the list of organisations that could be required to provide information.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para5"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 17 and 19 first. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, accepts that the broader amendment--I shall come to the narrower one in relation to legal privilege in a moment--contains a grey area of difficulty. Advice and professional assistance are rather wide terms. Their use in this amendment would restrict our power to add new organisations to the list at new subsection (2A). I shall not seek to provide examples because we do not intend to add anything further to the list; in any case, such additions would have to come before your Lordships' House. However, I can give the House examples of why that might be difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para6"></a>As drafted, the amendment would cover the information given in order to receive advice from a building society in response to a mortgage application. Information given in respect of mortgage applications could include details of income and capital. It could also include information on properties already held and, of course, the property for which the mortgage was requested. A frequent source of social security fraud is that people claim housing benefit as though they were renting, whilst actually owning the property, and they mislead about their income and capital. I am sure the House can see therefore that information <P>


<a name="column_1144"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>given to a building society in order to receive mortgage advice would be extremely pertinent to that area of crime.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para7"></a>As I say, there are grey areas. The term "advice" could also include advice that a bank might provide on investing income or transferring it overseas. We would similarly want to be able to obtain details of the information that somebody had supplied to receive that advice as that information might include details of money stolen from the benefit system, or income that was being hidden from the benefit system.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para8"></a>So following the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, if banks and building societies were not already on the list, they could not be added to it because, under certain circumstances, those organisations could be in the position of giving advice, even though the bulk of their activity relates to the giving of straightforward information.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para9"></a>Those are hypothetical examples. My point is that organisations which give advice to their customers may also have information which could assist us to detect fraud. But I share some of the noble Earl's concerns. There is a difference between asking an adviser what to do to avoid tax and asking a lawyer what is legally acceptable. I shall come to that in a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para10"></a>I have already given an assurance in Committee; I am happy to give it again. We will not add organisations such as the CAB or lawyers to the list of those from whom we may require information. Should we seek to add any other organisations to that list, we shall of course bring them back before the House in any case and the House can decide whether or not it is appropriate to proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para11"></a>I return to the core of the amendments. Since Committee I have been wondering whether we could do anything further to meet the concerns expressed, particularly those in relation to legal privilege, which is perhaps the one that really matters. Information subject to legal privilege can be argued to be a special case. We have made clear in paragraph 2.9 of the code that no information will be requested that is the subject of legal privilege. However, I am willing to consider tabling a government amendment at Third Reading specifically to exclude information subject to legal privilege from that which can be obtained under these powers because I accept that it is a particular case. I hope that that meets the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para12"></a>Amendment No. 18 seeks to limit the organisations that we can add to the list of those required to provide information to those organisations that collect and store only financial information. The Bill does not restrict itself to only financial information. If we did that, again we would be unreasonably narrowing our ability to combat fraud. Much of the information that we seek is financial, but not all. The composition of a household is not financial information. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, will know that above all we need to have that information. The details of where the claimant lives is not financial information. The details of any employment may not be wholly financial <P>


<a name="column_1145"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information. The information provided to substantiate a person's identity is not financial. Whether or not someone is in education is relevant to benefit but it is not financial information. We need all that information and more in order to combat fraud.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para13"></a>With that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able not to pursue his amendment. I hope that my response to Amendments Nos. 17 and 19 addresses the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Astor, on legal privilege embodied in Amendment No. 5A. In the expectation that I shall table an amendment at Third Reading to meet a concern which I accept may need more belt and braces than just the code of guidance, I hope that the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and the noble Lord, Lord Astor, will feel able to withdraw their amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-08_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, I take the point she makes about Amendment No. 18 and give a limited but warm welcome to her  comments on the forthcoming government amendment. She knows that it does not meet the whole problem. I suspect that it is all any of us could do in her shoes and I shall welcome it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches are grateful for the positive way in which the Minister reacted to this group of amendments and specifically to Amendment No. 5A. We feel that the issue of legal privilege is a special case. We look forward to seeing the amendment that she proposes to table at Third Reading. In the light of that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "10227-08_para15"></a><P>

("( ) No investigation or inquiry under this section shall be made until the validity of the National Insurance number held by the individual concerned has been checked.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 6 it may be helpful if I speak also to Amendments Nos. 46 and 49 which, in effect, seek to impose penalties for those who have an invalid or fraudulent national insurance number. This is an important area of the Bill, which we have not previously debated in Committee. The figures for national insurance numbers are, indeed, remarkable. I understand from a Written Answer on 13th March 2000 to a Question asked by my right honourable friend Mr Willetts in another place, that the number of national insurance numbers currently in issue is over 81 million, whereas the population is around 60 million.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para17"></a>There is a huge surplus of national insurance numbers floating round the system. Part of the reason for that is the fact that the number which are withdrawn as a result of death is relatively small. Clearly, there must be an initial assumption that if someone is using a false national insurance number, that in itself is a matter for concern and should be <P>


<a name="column_1146"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subject to penalties. Moreover, it is likely that the individual concerned will be engaging in fraud of one sort of another.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para18"></a>The amendment suggests, therefore, that the first step should be to check whether the national insurance number held by an individual is genuine. We think that that would be an efficient way to do it because at present the return which the department gets from carrying out investigations into fraud is far in excess of the cost. The Government have not pushed to the point where the cut in fraud is equal to the cost of ensuring that fraud does not take place. This would seem, therefore, to be an easy way to begin the search. Long before one gets to all the other questions of taking information from the whole list of bodies set out in Clause 1, the first step should be to check on the national insurance number.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para19"></a>Part of the situation is shrouded in mystery. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify a number of points. I understand that information is held on two different computers, NIRS2 and the DSS computer, but no doubt she can clarify where the information is held. None the less, I assume that somewhere in government--she will no doubt tell us where--there is a list of national insurance numbers and against that list the name of the person to whom they were issued.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para20"></a>There seems to be some doubt as to the stage at which a national insurance number comes into existence. The noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, in his report, to which I shall shortly refer in detail, thought that it happened at the age of 16. Others say that it happens at birth. No doubt the noble Baroness can help, but I believe that the child benefit number is converted into a national insurance number at a later stage. However, at all events the number should have a clear relationship to a specific name. That should give us a lead.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para21"></a>The overall situation is rather confused, but all one must ask is whether the national insurance number which a given individual has is one which is related to the name. It may well be that there is extensive organised fraud in this area where people can have tailor-made national insurance numbers which fit their name precisely. However, I suspect that some such transactions in themselves may be somewhat fraudulent and perhaps the fit is not as good, as reference to the Government's records would immediately reveal. That is the first point that we need to clarify.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para22"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, states in his summary of recommendations at (ii) that to combat identity fraud, which is the way he conveniently describes it, the procedures for issuing national insurance numbers should be tightened up in line with the regime already piloted by the Benefits Agency. He does not concern himself with tightening up those existing numbers. He is concerned in that summary with the issuance of new numbers.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para23"></a>The previous Conservative government introduced a series of measures to cut down on the prevalence of national insurance records, the most important of which was the data cleaning project, which was <P>


<a name="column_1147"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>designed to identify anomalies and duplicate records. It began in November 1995 and will apparently end in March 2001, which is now. Can the Government confirm that that is the intention? It would seem to be a strange thing to do at this time, given that the Bill is now going through the House. Perhaps the Government can tell us exactly what their intentions are.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para24"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, in his normal thorough way, goes into these matters of national insurance fraud in rather more detail. Indeed, he refers to the pilot study carried out in Balham--nothing to do with the late Tony Hancock who is, alas, no longer with us--and I believe an extremely high percentage of false national insurance numbers are located in the greater London area. At all events, the Balham study would seem to help in dealing with this. Again, before we get to Clause 1 of this Bill and from the point of view of rights and data protection measures, these measures would seem to be a better way, in the first instance, of dealing with the problem. That is what this amendment seeks to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, goes into more elaborate matters. For instance, The Day of the Jackal fraud system is perpetrated by means of false birth certificates of people who have died, and so on. This needs to be cleaned up. Outsiders can go and look at people's birth certificates, but it is not at all clear whether the person recorded on the certificate as having been born is also recorded as having died. Here again we think, as the noble Lord recommended, that there should be stricter control over the issue of birth certificates as a proof of identity. This is a problem that needs to be tackled.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para26"></a>Overall, it seems to us clear that to write into the Bill the first part of our proposal, namely, Amendment No. 6, would be an efficient and probably more cost-effective way of checking up on national insurance numbers. It would be helpful if the noble Baroness would clarify for us the factual situation and comment on Amendments Nos. 46 and 49, which seek to impose an immediate penalty on someone with fraudulent intent who is in possession of a false national insurance number. I beg to move.

Also, of course, we have a need for balance. On the one hand, we must try to track down and pursue the fraudulent use of national insurance numbers. On the other hand, perfectly genuine law-abiding people--many of them the victims of theft, as of credit cards--continue to have legitimate needs and a legitimate right to build up a pension entitlement. The two things need to be kept in balance somehow.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-08_para27"></a>Will the noble Baroness confirm, as I am sure she will, that so long as people have surviving dependants there may be an interest in maintaining national insurance numbers of people who are now dead? Secondly, can she tell us of the procedure which is <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I accept that your Lordships are concerned about the issue of national insurance numbers, of which there have been significant reports. Perhaps I may start with the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, partly in response to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, as to the apparent discrepancy between the size of the population, which he estimates as around 60 million, and national insurance numbers, of which over 80 million are in circulation. The noble Earl is absolutely right in saying that not only are numbers given to individual citizens but that numbers are allocated to children at the child benefit point. When someone dies, his national insurance number needs to continue to exist; in other words, to be a live number, because widows' benefits depend on it. Also, an EC national for example, who has come to this country, worked only for 12 months and then gone back to, say, Spain or Germany, none the less maintains a live number even though not a UK citizen and a member of our population base, because at some point he or she may return to the UK and wish to resume national insurance. Equally, foreign students who are permitted to work part-time have a national insurance number, although not part of the home population.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para0"></a>There may be UK nationals who are entitled to retirement or winter fuel payments even though they may be living abroad. There are even extreme examples of people, like Gurkhas, who are entitled to claim working families' tax credit, or the foreign wives of UK servicemen. Given all that, your Lordships will see that there is an understandable gap between the live population and the number of necessary national insurance numbers in circulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para1"></a>Regarding the cleaning project, yes, we identified about 200,000 mis-matched, unacceptable dead numbers which have been cleaned from the system. We have completed that exercise. May I say that the numbers of national insurance numbers being issued each year have not changed since the early nineties: there is not some sudden crisis identified with national insurance numbers. If a number is suspected to have been stolen, it is marked on the computer and checks are carried out to verify this. I hope I have brought the matter into perspective.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, also asked about the computers. The basic information is held on the department's central index but there is also additional information, such as the amount of contribution which is held on NIRS2, as he said. Given that background information, I hope I may persuade your Lordships that these amendments, though they may be pegs on which to express wider concern about national insurance numbers, really do nothing at all to help us. They are redundant and may even make the situation worse.
<P>


<a name="column_1149"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para3"></a>The first amendment would place a statutory duty on officers to check the validity of a person's national insurance number before initiating any enquiries under the powers of Clause 1; that is Amendment No. 6. We do this already. It is one of the basic building blocks before any further investigation into fraud can continue and therefore putting this on to the face of the Bill would achieve nothing at all. It is already absolutely standard practice. It is imperative that we establish at the outset the identity of the person suspected. I would ask the noble Lord to accept from me that this amendment is redundant, despite being useful as a peg on which to explain that we always do it. We do this already, and checking the national insurance number before we start on any serious investigation is an absolute requirement.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para4"></a>Turning now to Amendments Nos. 46 and 49, I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that they would achieve nothing new. It is already an offence to make a false statement in order to obtain benefit. That is what happens when a false insurance number is used. Of course, there may be a genuine error. A person may have been allocated a number as a child, perhaps when living abroad with their parents who were UK nationals, and stayed abroad before returning home perhaps 30 years later and has then innocently sought another national insurance number when starting work here, without realising that a number had been already allocated to them. There will be occasions when people innocently but erroneously hold two national insurance numbers. The issue is whether they use those numbers to perpetuate fraud. That was part of the debate we had earlier. It is already an offence, so once again this amendment is redundant.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para5"></a>The proposal would create a penalty specific to that offence which would tie the hands of the magistrates to a maximum penalty of £500. However, the existing offence attracts a penalty of up to £5,000 or six months' imprisonment. Therefore the noble Lord--I am sure unwittingly, innocently and in error--seeks to weaken the effect of the offence and the punishment which already exists by law.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para6"></a>I hope that I have addressed the point about the gap between the population and the numbers in circulation. I hope that I have covered the point about computers. I hope that I have addressed the issue raised by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, about what happens if the number is stolen. I hope that I have addressed the issues underlying the amendment by suggesting not only that they are already part of departmental procedure but that they are already offences and the amendment would weaken the ability of the department to handle those offences. In the light of all that, I hope that the noble Lord will not wish to pursue the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, can she confirm whether the cleaning project is continuing; and whether there is any extension of the Balham project?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I thought that I had mentioned the cleaning project. We have <P>


<a name="column_1150"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>identified something like 220,000 mismatched numbers. We have completed the exercise; it was finite. Perhaps I may write to the noble Lord on the Balham exercise. I can give him information about the local project.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para7"></a>However, on the basis of that exercise we have found significant areas of benefit fraud. It is not all associated with national insurance numbers. The project was set up in 1997. We have had validation trace units at seven of the sites within the offices. We have been looking at the allocation of ninos. As a result, there have been something like 166 arrests for identity fraud; a further six deportations; and by extending the initiative to neighbouring Benefits Agency offices in 1999 there were a further 46 arrests. We seek to make use nationally of the lessons learned from Balham. We now have specialist teams to combat identity fraud and the fraudulent use of ninos. From1st April 2000 we are not only continuing the work in Balham but extending it nationally. We are going live across London inside the M.25 corridor and Wales from 1st April 2000 where 70 per cent of all nino applications are handled. We have gone live in the rest of the country from 1st October 2000. So, yes, we are continuing the Balham project. We extended it to the M.25 and Wales last summer. Last autumn we went live to the rest of the country. I hope that I have answered the noble Lord's point on Balham.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for the points she made. I understand what she says about some national insurance numbers continuing in operation with regard to widows' benefits and so on. Clearly that is necessary. None the less the extent of the surplus seems to be very large--80 million people as against 60 million would scarcely be covered by that. It could surely be argued that we withdraw the number with regard to the owner but perpetuate it as regards the widow or other related claimant.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para8"></a>None of these matters covers the basic point which the Balham project--I am glad to hear that it is being extended--seems to confirm: that it will be a relatively simple exercise, albeit large scale, to check up on the extent to which the national insurance numbers held by an individual coincide with those which appear on the Government's records. There is the feeling that a large number of invalid national insurance numbers are being held. Therefore, to clean up the matter by making the initial inquiry on a national basis has much to be said for it in terms of reducing benefit fraud.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para9"></a>The Minister's other points are very fair. I take the point that inquiries are already made at the first stage on national insurance numbers. But that is the present situation before the Bill comes into operation as an Act. We were concerned that this should be an upfront part of the exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para10"></a>I concede the point the Minister makes on penalties. It merely demonstrates how important the issue has been considered in the past. The report of the noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, seems to bear out that point. It <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>gives considerable cause for concern with regard to surplus numbers and the stringency with which new numbers are issued.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para11"></a>I shall study carefully the point the noble Baroness makes. Clearly I shall need to amend the second set of amendments, if not the first, and return to the matter at Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

("( ) Prior to the exercise of the power conferred on an authorised officer to obtain information under this section, that officer shall obtain in writing the consent to carry out an investigation.
<BR>
( ) Consent shall be obtained from an official of seniority of "Band B" or above from the relevant department.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment is concerned with the way in which the powers conferred on authorised officers to obtain information under the clause shall be authorised and the level at which the investigations take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para15"></a>There is still considerable concern about the way in which the investigations will be carried out, despite the excellent amendments moved by the noble Baroness earlier, with no external check on whether it is reasonable to investigate an individual. The British Bankers Association still feels that independent external checks should be made on the way in which the Government operate. It remains of the view that one should have independent judicial authorisations for specific inquiries. It stresses that it does not understand why those suspected of benefit fraud should have a lower standard of protection against the invasion of their privacy than those suspected of tax fraud or criminal offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-09_para16"></a>The Minister has been kind enough to write to me and to others on this point. No doubt the noble Baroness will wish to put on record her arguments. The code of practice gives us more reassurance than we had in Committee. The protections which are built in seem to be more substantial than we had at first realised. On the other hand, it is not entirely clear how the system will operate in practice. We had understood that there were to be authorised officers. On page 10 of the code of practice we find a reference to a selection of individuals. There is reference to authorised officers; and we are clear about them. However, there will also be fraud investigators, decision makers, fraud specialists, responsible officers and accredited fraud officers. The relationship between each of these is not entirely clear.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I thought that the example given at the bottom of page 10 clarified the relationship between them extremely well.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, the example given is:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>necessary. He refers the matter to the Authorised Officer, together with the reasons for the request. The Authorised Officer makes sure these are valid reasons and, if so, makes the request of the Building Society and, upon receipt, passes the reply to the Fraud Investigator".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-10_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para1"></a>What gives cause for concern is that the whole argument turns upon whether it is reasonable to carry out the investigation. The initiative of the matter comes from the fraud investigator and then goes up to the fraud officer. The amendment seeks to establish at what level these decisions, which clearly involve an invasion of privacy and raise issues on human rights and so on, are likely to be carried out.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para2"></a>One of the other examples given is that the information is given on the basis of an anonymous tip-off. Perhaps the Minister can comment on that. If the tip-off received is anonymous rather than backed up by any further indication as to the source of the allegation or what has prompted it, do the Government regard that as a reasonable basis for carrying out an investigation. There may be all kinds of reasons why individuals make anonymous tip-offs; for example, they may not like the person.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para3"></a>If we look at that particular case, it appears that the person who has the ultimate say is not the authorised officer but the investigating officer. If that is so, it gives us some cause for concern.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I do not see an investigating officer. I have "fraud specialist", I have "decision maker", who actually makes the benefit decision, and the "authorised officer". Where is the investigating officer?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, doing this on one's feet is not perhaps the easiest thing to do. I have a list. I have authorised officers, fraud investigators, decision makers, who, as the Minister has said, are related to the decision on the actual benefit question. I have a responsible officer who turned up at some point and an accredited fraud officer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, but where is the investigating officer?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, it would have been easier perhaps in Committee to have found one, but then we did not have the draft code of practice. He is a fraud investigator. However, I am not clear whether sufficient protection is being given to ensure that the investigation is reasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para4"></a>I turn to the related points on this matter. The code of practice at paragraph 4.7 sets out what reasonable grounds are. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An Authorised Officer can require information only where he has reasonable grounds for doing so. Reasonable grounds are where an officer has good reason to believe a person is either committing fraud (or is intending to do so). What is reasonable would vary, depending upon the circumstances of the case, and each case should be considered on its own merits".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-10_para5"></a>
That is a most extraordinarily circular paragraph. I am not clear how that answers the question, what are reasonable grounds, although the code of practice goes on to give further examples.
<P>


<a name="column_1153"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para6"></a>What we are really concerned about here is whether, given that there is apparently to be no external approval as to whether or not an inquiry is justified, the level at which these inquiries are carried out is appropriate. Therefore, perhaps, given the various categories which we have now summarised, the Minister could tell us at what level in the Civil Service these particular offices will be filled. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, this provides me with my first opportunity to thank the Minister for providing us with the draft code of practice. That was extremely helpful. It is an extremely well-drafted code. It shows all the typical excellence of the Department of Social Security at putting itself under restraint coming from its own good judgment, while at the same time maintaining a vehement objection to any restraint placed upon it from any other quarter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Earl allow me to respond on that point? In fact he will find that "fraud investigators" appears in paragraph 3.2, but that apparently has not been drawn to the attention of the noble Baroness. So the drafting is somewhat strange.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. I thought that I remembered the phrase, but I did not succeed in finding it while he was speaking. I am sorry to have been so slow.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para7"></a>I return to the point. As a member of an institution, I sympathise with the objection to restraint from an outside quarter. On the other hand, most of us are subject to restraint and probably have to put up with it here and there. But although the draft code of practice tries to diminish the misgivings considerably, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that misgivings still remain. What, therefore, is the best thing to do is not necessarily a simple question.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para8"></a>Incidentally, I share the noble Lord's misgivings on the subject of anonymous tip-offs. They have been relied on in law enforcement in a variety of contexts at least since the Heresy Act of 1401, but they have led to a considerable number of miscarriages of justice. Having said that, I might remind the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that the person who put anonymous tip-offs centre stage when he was Secretary of State was none other than Mr Peter Lilley. I expressed misgivings about it at the time. I express misgivings about it now. Those are no party misgivings; they are simply a matter of concern for justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para9"></a>However, I come back to the point that I made at Second Reading about proportion between legitimate objectives. The Minister was not entirely pleased with the point I made. If I remember her words right, she said that the proportions did not always appear to her as they appeared to me. Fair enough, I do not expect it. But on this occasion perhaps the point about proportion may tell in the Minister's favour. It is often essential for the prosecution of fraud that the fraudster or potential suspect fraudster should not know that he is being investigated until fairly late on in the proceedings. Fraudsters have a capacity sometimes, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>not merely for disappearing but for evaporating. If their identity is fictitious they can collapse it and may never be found again. So there may be a strong case indeed for making approaches under cover quietly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para10"></a>It may be in terms of priority that the need for justice and the need for control justifies the use of a superior officer in the way that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, demands. I am capable of being persuaded of that point. However, I must say that the noble Lord has not yet so persuaded me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may respond first to the point about the anonymous tip-offs. I understand noble Lords' concerns. I was asked whether anonymous tip-offs alone would be reasonable grounds for an investigation. The answer is no.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para11"></a>An example may be where someone is understood to be a lone parent but a tip-off says that she actually has a live-in partner. That may be the kind of tip-off that one gets from a neighbour when they do not have a good relationship. Tip-offs of that kind would usually be raised with the claimant. Occasionally, very detailed tip-offs might be regarded as reasonable grounds, but in all cases they would be checked against our records on the claimant.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para12"></a>As I have said, the general presumption would be to check first with the claimant. Only detailed and serious allegations might trigger the need to go under cover. I hope that this gives the noble Lord some reassurance on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para13"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord asked about the relationship between the fraud specialist and the authorised official. At present, fraud specialists carry out investigations on the ground. Something in the order of half a million such investigations are carried out each year using current powers. Only a small number of authorised officials will be attached to each of the 13 units, usually between 10 and 50 officers. To use the additional, sensitive powers conferred by the Act, the fraud investigator would have to approach the authorised official in order that that official could make the inquiries on behalf of the fraud investigator. Given that many people are in the field carrying out work, we would not want such information "floating around the system", to borrow the phrase used by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, when we discussed this matter in Committee. Sensitive inquiries utilising the new powers contained in the Act must be carried out by the authorised official, who, in turn, must have "reasonable grounds" to investigate, which in turn must be clarified with the fraud investigator. I hope that that has clarified our slightly teasing exchange on this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para14"></a>The third question raised by the noble Lord concerned whether authorised officials will be sufficiently senior to have such powers entrusted to them. In Committee I said that such officials will be appointed at executive officer grade, grade B3 or its equivalent in a local authority. They will be authorised to act on behalf of the Secretary of State only once they have been given full professional training. I could give <P>


<a name="column_1155"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>details of that training but I shall not take up the time of the House unless noble Lords would like me to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para15"></a>The grade is a management grade equivalent to that of a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force or a second lieutenant in the Army. It would rank between a police sergeant and a police inspector, who similarly carry high levels of responsibility. The grade is the same as that required for officers who currently use departmental powers to inspect the records of employers about their employees. Most noble Lords would regard that work as equally sensitive. I have already indicated that management controls will be put in place to be implemented by sector managers.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para16"></a>Finally, if an individual or an information provider has a complaint or question about the manner in which these powers have been applied by the authorised official, they may direct their inquiry to the senior officer in the central intelligence unit or the investigation manager in the case of local authorities. The address will be included in all requests for information.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para17"></a>I have sought to establish that, first, anonymous tip-offs would not, as they stand, provide reasonable grounds for investigation. They would need to be checked with the claimant, although occasionally exceptions may be made. Secondly, the fraud specialist will carry out the day-to-day work on the ground of checking the integrity of benefits but the exercise of powers as regards data information conferred by the Bill must be handed to an authorised official who must demonstrate reasonable grounds so to act. Such authorised officials will be relatively senior members of staff, in the top quarter in terms of hierarchy of staff in the Benefits Agency. Thirdly, if a complaint is received about the inappropriate use of these powers, relevant information will be made widely available by the authorised officials.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para18"></a>I hope that, with those points, the noble Lord will feel that I have addressed his concerns.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-10_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I am not sure that I am impressed by the level at which these decisions are to be taken. Paragraph 3.7 of the code states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Authorised Officers will receive their authorisation from the Fraud Area Manager acting on behalf of the Secretary of State. Authorised Officers will be of management grades not below that of Executive Officer. They will be managed by officers not below the grade of Higher Executive Officer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-10_para19"></a>
It would seem that a person acting "on behalf of the Secretary of State" will not be below the rank of higher executive officer. The noble Baroness compared the grades with ranks in the Army and the Royal Air Force. However, they do not seem to be at a particularly high level. We shall need to consider that between now and Third Reading. We shall also need to consider the continuing concerns expressed by the banks and other organisations on the lack of external supervision.
<P>


<a name="column_1156"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-10_para20"></a>However, we have made considerable progress and the code of practice represents a substantial step forward. But, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, pointed out, ultimately this is a matter of balance. We need to weigh the degree of power conferred on officials on the one hand and the lack of external supervision on the other. Nonetheless, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her reassurances as regards anonymous tip-offs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to say that we shall review these procedures. The last thing the DSS wants to see is criticism from banks and building societies of the actions of its authorised officials. If we receive complaints, we shall either review the managerial supervision element or we shall review the training. If the fears expressed by the noble Lord turn out to be legitimate--I do not think that they will, because officers are already working with equal levels of responsibility in parallel fields; their behaviour is almost always exemplary--then we shall find that out. The code of practice offers plenty of opportunities to make adjustments through training and complaints procedures. Having said that, I should point out that, based on the body of experience from complaints officers currently working in the field, we believe that we have set these processes at the right level.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I understand the point. Again, although I am reassured by the noble Baroness's comments on training and so forth, if someone is carrying out an investigation which is not reasonable, that is far more a question of an individual's attitude to the issues than it is a question of training. I shall bear in mind the points made by the noble Baroness. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "10227-11_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment relates to the provisions as regards members of the family of a suspect. Again, the code of practice has proved to be extremely helpful. In Committee I raised the question of whether it was appropriate to include in the list of those who might be investigated people who were simply members of the family of someone <P>


<a name="column_1157"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who was otherwise suspect. That part of the Bill has now been radically changed. This is the only section which, in effect, has survived the helpful innovations introduced by the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para6"></a>The relevant paragraphs in the code of practice are paragraphs 2.11 and 2.12. That part of the code does seem to restrict the provision to inquiries about family members whose circumstances are directly relevant to the claim under investigation. For example, if a man is claiming a means-tested benefit but is not declaring his wife's earnings, inquiries may be made about her bank account in order to establish the truth. I have some doubts about the precise wording of paragraphs 2.11 and 2.12, but I think it would be helpful to discuss that when we discuss the code of practice as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para7"></a>This issue was raised in Committee. However, perhaps the Minister will state for the record precisely why she believes that the members of a family--defined precisely in the code of practice--may need to be investigated. Also, is she satisfied that there are adequate restraints on going beyond the particular cases where the fraudulent benefit claim immediately raises the question of family relationships?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, again I am happy to give the assurance that the noble Lord seeks. I explained in Committee that information about a person's family--the tightly defined nuclear family; in other words, the dependants who are covered by benefit--is needed by the department. People claim benefit not only for themselves but for their dependants.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para8"></a>The crucial point is that income-related benefits are based on household assessment; therefore, we need to know about the household. It is as simple as that. For example, people may be fraudulently claiming for children that they do not have; they may claim that they are single when they are a couple; or a man may be claiming a benefit when the woman is in work. The implication of the noble Lord's amendment is that if a single man were working and claiming benefit he would be prosecuted, but if a married man were claiming benefit when his wife was working--the same offence but within the household--we could not prosecute him. I am sure that that is not the noble Lord's intention.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para9"></a>So I am happy to give the noble Lord the assurance that he seeks. The notion of "family members" is tightly drawn. Because income-related benefits are household based, any claim is on behalf of the whole household; therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the information is correct and valid. That is why we need to retain the provision in paragraph (d).

<A NAME = "10227-11_para15"></a>Amendment No. 14 seeks to ensure that any inquiry initiated as a result of the Bill is pursued with the full knowledge of the data protection regulations and that the concerns expressed by the Information Commissioner about some provisions in the Bill have been taken into account.

Will the Minister give the House an assurance that knowledge of the data protection regulations will be required as part of the training of the authorised officers who will exercise the powers provided under the Bill?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para18"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 38, the Minister was kind enough to say that she would confirm whether or not an individual could request information held on him by the DSS and under what circumstances there would be an opportunity to do so. We are grateful to the Minister for the confirmation set out within the code of practice that an individual will be able to access personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Act. However, although the draft code of practice has established that an individual has the right to subject access, and would be eligible without our amendment to access personal data held on him by the DSS, it does not confirm at what stage, if any, individuals may access that information if they are under investigation in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. I beg to move.

<A NAME="10227-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Grabiner: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment No. 14. We examined this amendment on the first day of the Committee stage. My instinctive reaction then was that the amendment was unnecessary and that that is still my view.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para19"></a>I think that the source of the problem is that the Data Protection Act 1998 is widely misunderstood and that even experienced lawyers are a little nervous of it. I include myself in that category. The obscurities of the 1998 Act are driven by the fact that it has its origins in the human rights convention, and the legal concepts in the convention were then very novel, and still are quite novel, to English lawyers and legislators.

<A NAME = "10227-11_para20"></a>The relevant provision of the convention is Article 8. The first paragraph of the article spells out the right to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence. Obviously, the right is not absolute or unlimited. The convention is carefully structured and makes a sensible balance. Accordingly, paragraph 2 of Article 8 makes it plain that a public authority may be entirely justified in interfering with that right provided that the interference,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is in accordance with the law and is necessary ... [for] the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of... crime ... or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-11_para21"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para22"></a>Those two aspects of Article 8 are perfectly mirrored in the Data Protection Act. The right in paragraph 1 is covered by the so-called Data Protection Principles, especially the first principle. The limitation on the right is set out in Section 29 of the Act, which expressly exempts from the first data protection principle cases where personal data is processed for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime or for the purpose of apprehending or prosecuting offenders. It follows that in this context Article 8 of the convention is made effective in our domestic law by the Data Protection Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para23"></a>The next step in the argument is the Human Rights Act 1998. Section 3(1) of the Act requires that, so far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the convention rights. The obligation to construe all legislation in this way is, therefore, cast squarely on the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para24"></a>It will immediately be obvious that it is entirely unnecessary and indeed circular to introduce any provision into this Bill of the kind that we are now discussing. In the first place, it adds nothing to the Data Protection Act, which cannot be excluded or side-stepped. Secondly, Section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act means that, if and when the Bill becomes law, it must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the convention rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para25"></a>I should like to emphasise one further point that I believe is sometimes under-rated in our debates, and, for the most part, ignored in the representations from some of the outside bodies, or pressure groups, that have given their views on this particular subject. The purpose of Clause 1 of the Bill is to enable the DSS to detect or prevent crime and to apprehend and prosecute benefit fraudsters. That is an entirely legitimate object in any civilised society. It is specifically authorised by the convention. That is especially the case where these powers are necessary as a check on whether a particular benefit claimant has, on a previous occasion, given honest answers to questions properly put to him or her and where the answers are to be relied upon for the purpose of deciding whether or not the claimant qualifies for the relevant benefit. We must always take full account of the convention right in paragraph 1 of Article 8, but there is absolutely no justification for disregarding or watering down the limits on that right that we find in paragraph 2 of Article 8.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-11_para26"></a>In the result, I believe that this amendment is unnecessary for at least two reasons. First, if and when these powers in Clause 1 are enacted, they will be exercisable only in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998; and, secondly, the provision will have to be construed by the court compatibly with the convention because Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 says so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-12_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, that was an extremely helpful intervention, for which I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Grabiner. If the noble Lord will forgive me, I should like to probe one or two of his assertions. First, I do not have the text of the Human Rights Act with me today, but it is my recollection that the requirement to construe existing statutes in the light of the convention is a requirement to do so as far as possible. It must be so, otherwise the whole provision for a certificate of incompatibility would be unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-12_para0"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord is clearly persuasive in arguing that Clause 1 of the Bill is a legitimate object within the terms of the convention. However, it has been argued by the Data Protection Registrar that this object is subject to the requirement of proportionality. That is a fairly major argument. There is probably some obligation on this House to consider how far that requirement of proportionality is met. We know that the registrar has had some fairly significant misgivings at earlier stages of the Bill. I understand that discussions have taken place since then. I have heard in the most general terms only about the results of those discussions. However, before we leave this amendment, perhaps we could be enlightened on how far the registrar is currently reassured. That would be extremely helpful to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Grabiner: </B>   My Lords, I shall respond briefly to the noble Earl's observations. He is absolutely right to draw attention to the opening words of Section 3(1), which read:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"So far as it is possible to do so".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-12_para1"></a>
Indeed, I believe that I referred to those words when I drew attention to the provision. However, if it is not possible to do so, the possible consequence is that there would have to be a certificate of, so to speak, non-compatibility. In that event, there would be a potential problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-12_para2"></a>The noble Earl also referred to the issue of proportionality. The amendment now before us is one that would have the effect of making the operation of the powers contained in Clause 1 of the Bill expressly subject to the Data Protection Act 1998. The proportionality point does not arise by virtue of the Data Protection Act. It arises under that Act in any event, but it will also arise under this Bill, if and when it becomes law. Therefore, there is no need for this Bill to incorporate a provision that would make it in its operation subject to the Data Protection Act 1998, because the proportionality obligation will have to be satisfied under this legislation standing alone.
<P>


<a name="column_1159"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-12_para3"></a>We discussed this issue previously. I entirely agree that it must be necessary; and that means proportionate. The mere process of going through these proceedings--indeed, as we have done in previous debates--reveals most clearly that the product at which we are arriving is a proportionate response to a serious social and criminal problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am indebted to both my noble friend Lord Grabiner and to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, for expanding the point about the proportionality issue and the degree to which all legislation is subject to the Data Protection Act. That brings me to the first point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Astor. There is no need for amendment No. 14. There is nothing in the Bill that can enable us to contravene the Data Protection Act 1998. The noble Lord asked why we have not placed such a provision on the face of the Bill. I could respond and say that, equally, the Bill must not contravene the Human Rights Act 1998, the Race Relations Act 1976, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 or the freedom of information legislation. However, we do not seek to place them on the face of the Bill. The law is the law; and, by law, we cannot contravene the law. The Data Protection Act 1998 is the law. Therefore, putting a provision on the face of the Bill to the effect that we cannot contravene it would not change the fact that we cannot contravene it; in other words, the suggested provision would be otiose. Indeed, I believe that my noble friend Lord Grabiner put the case most succinctly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-12_para4"></a>The question was also raised as to whether the Data Protection Act and its obligations and responsibilities should form part of the training of authorised officers, which I believe to be a most helpful and pertinent question. Yes, indeed, it is important that they should understand that their actions must fall within that framework.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-12_para5"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 38, and the question of data. As I believe we made clear in Committee, we generally keep data for 14 months, unless it is needed for prosecution purposes. Anyone can ask for the data that is held upon himself at any stage, so long as that request would not jeopardise any investigation. For my own interest, I asked to have sight of a typical print-out of what might be held on a real but anonymised individual in the social security computers. This gives information about national insurance numbers, family, employment, and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-12_para6"></a>In the light of that, I was also asked whether it would be reasonable to reduce the time limit of 40 days down to 21. The reference in the amendment to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the relevant agencies or bodies",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-12_para7"></a>
which would include the DSS and local authorities, would also, presumably, include banks and other organisations listed in subsection (2A), as set out in Clause 1. That would mean that the noble Lord's amendment to restrict the time available to make such enquiries to 21 days would not only apply to the DSS but would also apply to banks, building societies, credit reference agencies, and everyone else. As a <P>


<a name="column_1160"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>result, I believe that those organisations would be extremely unhappy. They are currently subject to the same 40-day requirement as applies to the DSS. However, as the amendment is framed, they, too, would be brought within the 21-day requirement. I am sure that they would find this very hobbling in terms of their ability to respond, because the time limit would be halved and could be seen as unreasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-12_para8"></a>Finally, I was asked whether the Data Protection Registrar was reassured in terms of what we propose. The truth is that we have not heard from the registrar recently on the subject. I understand that she has been sent the draft code of practice, but has not responded. I believe that it is fair to say that her original concerns have been addressed in part by the amendments that we have proposed, especially Amendment No. 8 that the House accepted earlier, and by the publication of a code of practice, which will be a statutory code of practice. If the registrar has other concerns, she will no doubt communicate them to us. However, I have checked the position. That was certainly the situation yesterday. I rechecked to confirm whether or not we had heard anything further today, but we had not. That is the best information that I can give to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-12_para9"></a>Having addressed some of the concerns that your Lordships expressed--one about the code of practice and the other about subsection (2A)(a), (b) and (c), which was dealt with by way of Amendment No. 8--I hope that my response will also allay the concerns that the Data Protection Registrar gave in response when the Bill was originally published.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for that clarification from the Minister. I cannot recollect saying anything in my short speech to either amendment about putting anything on the face of the Bill. I have checked my notes and I cannot recollect saying that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-12_para10"></a>The points made by the noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, were helpful, particularly as regards clarifying the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act as they relate to the two amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I have misunderstood the noble Lord. However, Amendment No. 14 states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nothing in this Act shall authorise an inquiry which contravenes any provision of the Data Protection Act 1998".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-12_para11"></a>
In other words, the noble Lord asks for a provision on the face of the Bill that nothing we do can contravene any provision of the Data Protection Act. As I said, that cannot happen. We cannot contravene the provisions of the Data Protection Act because that is law, in the same way as we cannot contravene the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act and so on. As I say, perhaps I have misunderstood the noble Lord.

<P>

<A NAME="10227-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I accept the points that the noble Baroness makes. These are probing <P>

<P>
<A NAME="10227-12_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, that statement was signed originally before the Second Reading. I believe that it was signed at the First Reading of the Bill. I signed that the Bill was compatible with human rights. I believe that on a couple of occasions the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, told me that I had signed that measure and that he held me personally responsible for that. It was certainly signed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I take the Minister's word that it does not matter that the measure is not on the face of the Bill at all the other stages.

We inserted that measure in response to the concerns that the noble Lord expressed in Committee. Therefore I feel slightly miffed that we responded to those concerns in the draft code of practice but he has failed to acknowledge that. Paragraph 4.5 of the draft code of practice states:

<A NAME = "10227-13_para18"></a>We had a lengthy debate in Committee regarding whether or not the Bill should make provision for a code of practice. I explained that it had always been the Government's intention to have a code of practice regarding the use of provisions under Clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill--the powers to obtain information. I also explained that we did not intend to commence using those provisions until the code had been published. I recognised, however, that the House, and organisations in the private sector, wanted greater certainty on this point, and I agreed to consider whether we could bring forward a government amendment to make provision on the face of the Bill for a code of practice, which is what we have done. The detail of the proposed provision is in Amendment No. 22.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-13_para19"></a>This amendment provides that the Secretary of State must consult on a draft of the code before it is published. We have already met with representatives from business and local authorities to discuss what should be in it and we shall continue to hold dialogue with them further to develop the draft code which has already been provided to your Lordships. Additionally, this provision provides for formal consultation both on a first draft after the Bill receives Royal Assent and on subsequent revisions of the code following its publication.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-13_para20"></a>This amendment provides that the Secretary of State shall issue a code of practice relating to the provisions at Clauses 1 and 2. The House can thus be certain that the powers in Clauses 1 and 2 will always be exercised within its framework.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-13_para21"></a>The amendment provides that the Secretary of State may revise the code of practice from time to time. The private sector organisations have suggested to us that they would find it helpful if the code of practice were regularly reviewed. A suggestion of three years has been made. We think that that might be beneficial to all concerned. It would enable private sector organisations to provide feedback--the sort of research that we discussed earlier as regards any complaints about how things were working. It would give both the private sector organisations and authorised officers in both DSS and local authorities an opportunity to say whether or not they find the code helpful. Consequently, I give an assurance to the House that we would review the code of practice within three years of its publication and that the code would be revised, if necessary, in accordance with that review.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-13_para22"></a>The amendment also provides that the final version of the code of practice be laid before both Houses of Parliament and, above all, that authorised officers must have regard to the code, where it is relevant, when they exercise the powers in Clauses 1 and 2. The code of practice shall be admissible in criminal and civil proceedings. So if an authorised officer fails to comply with the code of practice that could be taken into account by a court of law.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-13_para23"></a>Amendment No. 54 amends the commencement provisions of the Bill. It provides that Clauses 1 and 2 may not be commenced until the code of practice has <P>


<a name="column_1165"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been published. Our discussions with the Information Commissioner, which is the Data Protection Registrar, and representatives from business indicate that this would be a welcome addition to the Bill's provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-13_para24"></a>Perhaps I may say a word or two about the code of practice. I emphasise that the work is in draft. Negotiations are ongoing. A document may go through many stages before it is published. At the moment it makes no reference to local authorities because we are currently in consultation. We had a helpful meeting last week, but we still have to do further work with them as to what shape the code will take. We plan to provide the next draft before the Bill reaches the Committee Stage in another place, subject to the rest of the consultations, particularly with the local authorities, proceeding satisfactorily. 
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-13_para25"></a>I believe that in the code we have addressed the key issues of what the powers are, who will use them and how they will be used. There is an introductory chapter setting out its purposes and a specific chapter setting out the various safeguards pertaining to the use of the powers. We have tried to include examples as we have proceeded as to how the powers might be exercised.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-13_para26"></a>It is a code which is primarily aimed at authorised officers. It is designed to instruct them on how they must use the powers. But we also want it to be intelligible and legible to business and to any private individual who wishes to find out more. We have endeavoured to set out what is and what is not reasonable in the exercise of the information powers. For example, we have stated that authorised officers should always consider the option of making a direct approach to the customer if they need information about them. Unless there are grounds for thinking that an investigation would be compromised by approaching the customers direct, this would be our immediate route for obtaining information. We would only make an approach to the information provider if there is no other feasible option available. At paragraph 2.9 the code makes clear that information subject to legal privilege may not be obtained under these powers. I have given a commitment that I shall return to this matter at Third Reading with an amendment to that effect because it is such an important and sensitive issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-13_para27"></a>I hope that your Lordships will find the draft code helpful. I will, of course, take on board your Lordships' comments including those made in correspondence, if that might be helpful subsequently because, as I say, such a draft code goes through many stages of revision before it is laid before Parliament. These amendments make provision on the face of the Bill for a code of practice governing the use of provisions in Clauses 1 and 2. They also ensure that the measures in those two clauses cannot begin until the code of practice has been published and laid before both Houses of Parliament and that, before publishing the code, the Secretary of State must consult on a draft of it. We shall have further consultations in order to review the draft within three years. I hope that your Lordships will welcome these amendments. I beg to move.

<A NAME="10227-13_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the whole House will be very grateful for the extremely constructive and flexible attitude which the Minister has adopted throughout our proceedings on this Bill. We certainly welcome the amendment which puts the code of practice on a statutory basis. Already in the course of our debates we have picked up various points in the draft code of practice. At this stage of the proceedings I do not intend to repeat them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-13_para28"></a>However, there are one or two points which are worth questioning. The first arises from an exchange which took place a moment or two ago between the noble Baroness and my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever. I had not previously noticed that the Bill, as printed at Report stage, does not include, as it did when published at Committee stage, an assurance by the Minister that the Bill conforms to the European Convention. It is possible, although unlikely, that the form of the Bill may change during the course of its proceedings through this House and the other place in such a way that it is inconsistent with the convention.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010227/text/10227-14.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, was it on the original Bill as published for the Committee stage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, the original Bill has an undertaking from the noble Baroness giving an assurance that it is in conformity with the convention. Suddenly, it has disappeared.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that it has already been given. It may well be a printing error which has been well spotted for its omission. The crucial issue is the undertaking that was given in writing when the Bill was originally published and that stands.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I understand that very well. I have never noticed it before. It is possible that an amendment has been made which is not in conformity with the convention. However, the noble Baroness says that that is not so, but it is possible. What is relevant to the present debate is that it seems possible now that we are putting the matter on a statutory basis, that there is something in the code of practice which does not conform. I do not believe that that is stretching the matter too much. The assurance that has been given needs to be considered by the House. Perhaps in a more general sense--and it is not appropriate to discuss it at this point--the House should consider whether the way in which we handle this particular issue is the best way of doing so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para0"></a>Perhaps I may return to one other point as regards the amendment before making one or two general points on the draft code of practice. I am not quite clear how subsections (7) and (8)in the new clause interact. Subsection (7) states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A failure on the part of any person to comply with any provision of the code of practice for the time being in force under this section shall not of itself render him liable to any civil or criminal proceedings".
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para1"></a><P>


<a name="column_1167"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Subsection (8) states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The code of practice for the time being in force under this section shall be admissible in evidence in any civil or criminal proceedings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-14_para2"></a>
If those subsections interact in any way, and if we are going to make a statutory code, then if someone has failed to do something which is in the code there is an argument for saying that that should not render them liable to civil or criminal proceedings. The fact that such matters can be used in evidence in respect of another offence not related to the code does not appear to be right. Obviously, this is a highly technical matter. It would be helpful if we could have an indication as to how those two subsections interact.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para3"></a>I have covered most of the points that I need to make. As regards the pure drafting of the code, it appears that no-one has read it straight through. For example, I refer to paragraph 2.4 which begins,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"However, any authorised officer shall not ask for information"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-14_para4"></a>
and so forth. Then it states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For example, we will not ask a utility company to obtain a current meter reading".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-14_para5"></a>
There appears to be a change from first to third person. There are similar examples in paragraphs 2.11 and 2.12.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para6"></a>As regards the local government code of practice, in correspondence the noble Baroness has indicated that it will be available in March. Will we have it before Third Reading?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I thought I had made that point clear in my original remarks, but perhaps I was speaking too rapidly. I said that we were still in discussion with local authorities. That code will be incorporated into the other and we hope that it will be in place, subject to discussion and agreement, in time for the Committee stage in another place. We have gone further and faster in our discussions with business than with local authorities, although they are in parallel track.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for that information. Because of the imminence of a general election it is very important that the code is available before then.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para7"></a>I have one extremely important point which arises at paragraph 4.13. It states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Authorised officers will not make enquiries in person by means of a visit. The power to inspect promises only relates to enquiries made to an organisation about their employees".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-14_para8"></a>
I believe the word should be "premises".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the amendment, which provides for a statutory code. I think that I am right in saying that the provisions to which my noble friend Lord Higgins has drawn attention are very similar to, if not exactly the same as, the provisions about the Highway Code, which have existed for some considerable time. The important thing is that the definition of offences has to be in the Bill. I wondered whether that was absolutely plain when the Minister was responding to the previous <P>


<a name="column_1168"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment. It must be right that the definition of offences has to be in the Bill. The code cannot create offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para9"></a>On the other hand, a failure to comply with the provisions of the code might be evidence that an offence defined under the statute has been committed. It is important that the statute defines the offences. One cannot use the code to modify or reduce the scope of the statutory provision for offences. I should be glad to have that confirmed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I listened to that intervention with great interest. I shall re-read the code of practice with that question in mind between now and Third Reading, as I am sure the Minister and many others will also do.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para10"></a>On the whole, it seemed to me that the code was concerned with creating defences rather than offences. In the very short time available to me, I have not seen anything in the wording of the code to which I wish to object. I warmly congratulate the Minister on the work that she has done on the subject. In our preliminary meeting, she made encouraging noises about the code of practice and its time of appearance. She has performed a great deal more than she has promised. That is entirely the right way round. I take her point that consultation is still in progress. We saw it in progress a few minutes ago and I very much welcomed its operation. I am in no position to complain about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para11"></a>It is highly unlikely that we have done anything contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights that was observed by neither the noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, nor my noble friend Lord Goodhart. I am inclined to fall back on Locke's remark when he saw the proofs of his Second Treatise of Civil Government--that printers have ways all their own, not united by the general fairness that cements mankind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Grabiner: </B>   My Lords, on the point about the certificate of endorsement, for the sake of the record the first version of the Bill carried the endorsement by my noble friend the Minister to the effect that the provisions of the Bill were compatible with the convention rights. The current version, produced after Committee stage, does not carry that endorsement. Section 19(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, which contains the obligation to produce the statement, provides that before Second Reading the Minister must,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"make a statement to the effect that in his view the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the Convention rights".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-14_para12"></a>
That obligation has been complied with. The Act also says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The statement must be in writing and be published in such manner as the Minister making it considers appropriate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-14_para13"></a>
The statutory obligation has been satisfied.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, my Lords. I have had similar advice from the Table, which is that the endorsement appears after the First Reading and only <P>


<a name="column_1169"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>once in each House and does not have to be repeated at each stage of the Bill. I was wrongfooted and thought that maybe it had been left off accidentally. The basic point is that the original certification casts its halo over all subsequent proceedings and does not need to be repeated. I am intrigued that we have spent longer on that today than on many of the other issues in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para14"></a>The second point that has been raised was on the code. I welcome the welcome that has been given around the House to the code. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, referred to an apparent incompatibility between subsections (7) and (8) on what was liable. Subsection (7) says that a failure to comply with the provision will not render a person liable to civil or criminal proceedings. That is a standard in statute providing for codes of practice. It ensures that the authorised officer will not incur personal liability merely for breaching the code. It will not prevent him being prosecuted for an offence committed in connection with his duties. Subsection (8) provides that the code shall be admissible as evidence in any civil or criminal proceedings. In other words, a court may have regard to the code when considering whether an authorised officer has acted properly in his exercise of the information powers set out in the Bill. If the noble Lord wants further elaboration, I shall be happy to write to him.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para15"></a>On the point about "premises" and "promises", all that I can say is, "Promises, promises, thank you very much".
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para16"></a>Finally, in response to the thoughtful speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern--we would expect nothing less--I shall re-read his comments and see whether we need to take any further action, but we agree with what he said.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para17"></a>In the light of that, I hope that your Lordships will again feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew10"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   It is your amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-14_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Ouch! I hope that your Lordships will be able to withdraw any objections and will accept my amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-14_para18"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<A NAME="10227-15_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Speaker   (Lord Murton of Lindisfarne): </B>  My Lords, before I call Amendment No. 23, I remind noble Lords that if it is agreed to, I shall be unable to call Amendment No. 24, owing to pre-emption.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 23:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 7, line 18, leave out from ("authorising") to the end of line 38 and insert ("payments to be made to any person for information obtained by virtue of the powers contained in subsection (2A) of section 109B.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-15_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 25. Amendment No. 23 has two objectives. First, it would widen the categories of persons who may be recompensed by the Secretary of State in return for providing information under the <P>


<a name="column_1170"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>new powers. Secondly, it would remove the Secretary of State's discretion on who is to be paid and the amount of such payment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para2"></a>Clause 3 restricts the potential recipients of payment to credit reference agencies, telecommunications providers and, to a limited extent, water, gas and electricity suppliers. It therefore excludes a number of other organisations from the possibility of payment, notably banks and insurance companies. It also restricts the amount that can be paid to utility companies. Those organisations will bear the majority of the inquiries as a consequence of the Bill--around 55 per cent on the department's estimate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para3"></a>This is fundamentally a question of equity. The Bill would create a large number of potential information providers to help in the fight against social security fraud. That has not been challenged. The issue is the fairness of the burden of compliance. The Government, who will be the beneficiary of the inquiries, hope to save at least £200 million through lower benefit payments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para4"></a>In Committee, the Minister explained that there was a general principle that the Government do not pay for information that they are authorised by law to collect. Past practice does not necessarily make that a good principle when we consider the burdens on business. We also know that the general principle is not absolute. It was ignored in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and is ignored again to an extent in this Bill in relation to credit reference agencies and telecoms providers.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para5"></a>The Minister also argued in Committee that businesses could afford to pay. She read out some profit figures from some major banks. I am troubled by that. If businesses have legitimately made profits in the UK or elsewhere and paid tax on them, that does not create a reservoir into which the Government can dip as they choose.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para6"></a>Those net profits belong to the shareholders. We should not assume that strong profits are made by all the companies that the Government intend to bring within these new information powers. I cite Equitable Life as an example of an insurance company where extra costs would impact on policy holders. The banking sector is also diverse in scale and profitability. We can not assume ability to pay.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para7"></a>I accept that if Government estimates of up to £7.6 million in additional costs are correct, that would not be a large burden on business; but those estimates may be incorrect. Against the background of increasing regulatory burdens on businesses, we should draw a line somewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para8"></a>I hope noble Lords will agree that with this small amendment we can send a positive message about regulatory burdens to the business community.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para9"></a>Amendment No.23 removes the discretion to pay whatever the Secretary of State thinks fit. Amendment No.25 defines that in terms of the costs that are reasonably incurred. Costs will need to be defined, and I hope that they will include the opportunity cost of capital, so that the ability to pay a profit-inclusive <P>


<a name="column_1171"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>price to the credit references agencies, which is a matter that concerned the Minister at Committee stage, would not be affected.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para10"></a>I do not believe that this provision would plunge the Department of Social Security into an administrative quagmire, nor do I believe that businesses would haggle and thereby delay the use of the powers, as suggested by the Minister in Committee. It is unlikely to be in their interests to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para11"></a>I note that the department is prepared to negotiate constructively with credit reference agencies and telecommunications providers, and I hope that the same spirit would prevail in relation to other information providers. I am confident that their representative bodies could present practical solutions that would not create an excessive burden as a result of the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para12"></a>The amendment requires fair payment to be made to those drawn within the net of information providers.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para13"></a>I hope that noble Lords will therefore support the amendment.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-15_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has raised an issue that goes way beyond the confines of the Bill. It is a big and an important issue. Therefore, it is not entirely proper to seek resolution tonight because we can only resolve a small part of it. Nevertheless, she has placed noble Lords in her debt by raising the issue, and I hope that the thought she has provoked will spread beyond those here present.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para14"></a>There is an ongoing general argument about the division of cost between government and business. It not only arises in the context of administration undertaken by business on behalf of the Government but it arises constantly in all the debates on social costs and regulation. I should like to see all those issues considered together in a process of negotiation in which we might be able to work out, on some intelligent general principles, who pays for what.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para15"></a>What I would not be so happy with is a process of slow, administrative creep, in which, bit by bit, administration is passed over to private companies and private bodies and carried out on behalf of the department. It began in the Student Loans Bill 1990, when universities were required to take on the day-to-day administration of student loans. That involved taking on a considerable number of staff, running an office, and paying costs that in many cases could have been used to employ one member of teaching staff, and probably two. During the passage of that Bill the Government, purely voluntarily, chose to make a concession. It was not, of course, the full cost-- it never is-- but it was extremely welcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para16"></a>In Committee the Minister resisted the idea that the full cost should be met. She said that the Secretary of State should pay what appeared to him to be appropriate, a power that could be curbed or curtailed, where necessary, by judicial review. I am not aware that the Treasury is as easily controlled by judicial review as perhaps some other departments of state.
<P>


<a name="column_1172"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para17"></a>The principle that public funds are adequate for the purpose for which they are voted seems to be regarded in certain Whitehall quarters as a tautology. This is an issue that should be considered in a wider context than the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para18"></a>I read the Minister's arguments in Committee because I was unable to be present. She argued that the Government do not pay for information that people are required to supply by law, but do pay firms that make their living out of supplying information for money. That approach has a coherence and an intelligibility in the short term, as a stop-gap measure, and is not an inadequate resolution of the problem. However, in saying that, I do not suggest that we should happily leave the situation as it is.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para19"></a>I remember the protests of British Airways against the charges imposed on it under carriers' liability. It seemed to me that those points were very well taken. An enormous administrative burden was being placed on a body that was not particularly well trained for it, and not equipped with the necessary powers of interpretation and knowledge of immigration law. The idea that administration is part of the majesty of the state, and should be so taken, is not one lightly to be lost sight of.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para20"></a>I hope that, after the little local business outside Westminster is over some time in the next few months, whoever is then in office will be prepared to sit down with representatives of finance and business and enter into a genuine, serious process of consultation about how the general issue of who pays for what should be resolved. It is in that hope that I am prepared in the short term to see the Bill remain as it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I also support the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. Businesses today already face a torrent of red tape, while at the same time trying to remain enterprising and thriving. On their shoulders lie the responsibility of creating the wealth of the nation, and they are competing with foreign companies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para21"></a>In responding to the two amendments, can the Minister clarify the position of mutuals and other non profit-making organisations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No.23 strikes out the categories of organisation that receive payment for supplying information and substitute a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that arrangements are in place, as he thinks appropriate, for requiring authorised payments to be made to any persons in the list in Clause 109B(2A) in respect of information obtained under the new powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para22"></a>Amendment No.25 inserts a new subsection requiring that payments made to information providers should be equivalent to their costs.

<A NAME = "10227-15_para23"></a>We debated the amendments in Committee. Our starting point, as stated so elegantly by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, is that where organisations are required by law to provide information to Government, we do not pay for it. I gave the Committee various examples. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Committees have to provide extensive information to Inland Revenue and Companies House, for example, but they are not reimbursed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para24"></a>The Information Commissioner-- Data Protection Registrar-- requires organisations to complete detailed registrations of their data holdings, purposes, suppliers and recipients, but she does not pay them for this information. Banks are required to report suspicions of money laundering to the National Criminal Intelligence Service. Utilities are required to provide information to the regulator to enable him to carry out his statutory duties. I do not wish to labour the point, but I simply repeat what I said in Committee: the DSS has had powers since the 1940s to require information from employers about their employees. Again, we do not pay for this, and it was not something that was proposed by the preceding government in the previous 20 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para25"></a>This is a good country in which to do business. Multi-national companies are setting up in business in the UK because of our stable economy and benevolent regulatory regime. At the other end of the scale, as I am sure the noble Baroness will know, small French companies are relocating to Kent because the regulatory burden is less and the incentives greater. I could go on to expand on what the Government have done to reduce burdens on business.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-15_para26"></a>With regard to regulation, we have the lowest level of product market regulation of any OECD country. The labour market is less heavily regulated than in other EU countries. The non-wage ongoing labour costs are among the lowest in the OECD and the European Union. The Regulatory Reform Bill will allow us to enact important reforms that otherwise would not take place because of pressure on parliamentary time. Those reforms will be beneficial to business. Each department now has a Minister who is responsible for regulatory reform. We have cut taxes on business. We have cut corporation taxes by a full 3 per cent, and the main rate is now the lowest ever in the UK.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, what is product market regulation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, it is an attempt to control standards and the like, as opposed to labour regulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para0"></a>The main rate of corporation tax is now the lowest ever in the UK and the lowest in any major industrialised country. We have cut the small companies' rate by 3 percentage points from 23p to 20p. We have introduced a 10p starter rate of corporation tax, and so on. The Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report that the Government are considering other ways in which to provide a more competitive environment for business, including the abolition of outdated requirements for withholding tax on intra-UK interest and royalty payments, reform of the tax treatment of intellectual property, goodwill and other intangible assets, regimes for the tax treatment of gains on the disposal of substantial shareholdings, and extending the on-shore <P>


<a name="column_1174"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pooling rules for double taxation relief. I should be glad not to be pressed further on what that might entail. I could go on, but I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that in relation to all those dimensions the Government are committed to establishing a regime in which business can thrive and be competitive.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para1"></a>Essentially, the noble Baroness is arguing that businesses should not incur any costs in helping the Government to fight benefit fraud. That is where we part company. Fraud is theft from the taxpayer. Businesses which operate in the UK enjoy an environment and infrastructure paid for by the UK taxpayer. The police, who protect businesses from crime, are funded by the taxpayer. The courts, where businesses defend their rights, are funded by the taxpayer. And businesses are taxpayers, too.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para2"></a>However, the fact remains that businesses enjoy the many benefits of trading in this country and, in so doing, make strong and handsome profits. The share of the cost of enacting these proposals in the case of, for example, Barclays would amount to approximately 75 minutes' profit for the whole year.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para3"></a>I have heard the argument that the costs would be passed on to customers in the form of higher charges. I do not accept that for one moment. The debates which we had in Committee about profits speak for themselves. I understand why businesses would seek not to carry that responsibility, but I believe that it is right that businesses should meet the costs for the greater good of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para4"></a>Amendment No. 25 seeks to require the Secretary of State to pay information providers an amount equivalent to the costs that they have reasonably incurred rather than an amount which he considers appropriate. The point that I wish to make in this respect is that this amendment undermines the whole logic of paying credit reference agencies. As a result of this amendment, they would be worse off than they would be under the Government's proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para5"></a>Credit reference agencies accumulate information in order to sell it. I believe that that point was made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, in discussing where we should draw the line. That is their business and it is how they make their profit. We believe that it is only right for the DSS to pay them the market rate--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the Minister did not hear what I said when I talked about profit. I said that there was no reason why it should not include the opportunity cost of capital, which in ordinary accountancy language translates into profit when the books are made up at the end of the year. I did not say that using costs would deprive businesses of the ability to pay a profit-inclusive price. Indeed, that would be a possibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the noble Baroness is saying that it would be a possibility, not an inevitability. Am I right?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-16_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, I am saying that if the Government wanted to, they could do that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-16_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, certainly I would not wish to put words into the noble Baroness's speech which she did not intend to use.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para6"></a>I return to my substantive point. We are trying to distinguish organisations to which we seek to pay the going rate because they make their profit from that activity. This amendment, as pressed by the noble Baroness, would limit us to paying only their costs. The credit reference agencies might be surprised at that suggestion, particularly given the noble Baroness's experience in the business world and their expectation that she might speak on their behalf.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para7"></a>Although the noble Baroness says otherwise, we believe that the amendment would plunge the department into complex negotiations and renegotiations with specified suppliers of information about what they consider to be the reasonable costs of providing each and every piece of information. As I said, while that was happening the system would continue to be defrauded. I believe that the better way forward, as provided in the Bill, is for the Secretary of State to be able to meet the costs which he considers appropriate. Businesses can rely on the fact that the unreasonable use of the power would be curbed by judicial review.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para8"></a>I do not doubt that the utilities, the credit reference agencies and the telecommunications companies could afford to meet the costs of compliance. However, that is not the issue. We are seeking to make a distinction in paying those categories of business for those types of information. We were not motivated by whether or not they could afford to help us. It was a question of whether or not it was their task or job to help us.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para9"></a>The job of credit reference agencies is to sell information. If that information were made available free of charge, they would have no business. In the case of the utilities and telecommunications companies, in Committee I explained in detail why we considered it right to pay them for some of the information that they would provide--that is, for the purposes of electronic matching. Again, we consider that approach to be fully in line with the department's approach to the Royal Mail, which we also pay for providing electronic data for matching.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para10"></a>We included telecommunications companies because, for the purposes of data matching, they have invested in special technology to help to meet government inquiries. The House will note that those powers do not allow us to require organisations to alter their procedures or invest in special technology, and so on. That is why we believe that they are in a special position.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para11"></a>We do not believe that we are making unreasonable demands. We are seeking to make our inquiries in such a way that the costs are minimised. I have given commitments that businesses will not be required to invest in special software. They will not be required to obtain information especially in order to meet inquiries. They will not be required to store information differently or to store it for longer. Businesses need not fear these powers.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para12"></a>I hope that I have reaffirmed the distinction that I tried to draw in Committee between paying for information which, on the one hand, it is the sole purpose of an organisation, such as a credit reference agency, to provide, or to pay for the additional costs that we may impose on telecommunications companies for the technology required for data matching. We consider it reasonable to meet those costs. However, we do not believe that we should pay banks and insurance companies and the like for information which we can reasonably expect them to provide in our combined effort to fight fraud, particularly financial fraud, of which they are almost as much the victim as is the DSS.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para13"></a>Finally, the noble Lord asked me a question about mutual companies. Mutuals and non-profit organisations are also liable to respond to our requests for help without payment. If they have information, we shall seek to pursue it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-16_para14"></a>In the light of those assurances, apart from the broader debate about regulatory burdens on industry, which may indeed be the subject of a proper Wednesday afternoon debate on some occasion, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, suggested, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-16_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, does she accept and share with her right honourable friend the view that this is not simply a particular problem but one part of a rather more general problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-16_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I do not wish to trespass on debates that have already taken place on the Regulatory Reform Bill, in which these issues were addressed on a wider front. However, I certainly agree that the interaction of government with business takes place across a wide front of government activity. Therefore, it is important that there is an overview and that these interventions and interactions are coherent and reasonable. I believe that I am right in saying that my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer has responsibility in the Cabinet Office for that function. That is why in each department a Minister is appointed to ensure that the burdens are reasonable. They are overviewed by the Cabinet Office. Therefore, I hope that the noble Earl will accept that the Government are acting to ensure that an oversight of this information is held at a most senior level.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-16_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her response. It disappoints me but perhaps does not surprise me. Perhaps I may state for the record that I was not trying to propose an amendment which would have deprived the department of the ability to pay the credit reference agencies a price which included their normal profit. Indeed, if the words that I proposed were deemed to be seeking that, I should have considered amending them. That was not what I sought. I was seeking to make a general point about the increasing regulatory burdens and the need to draw the line as to when those burdens should be more fairly shared out. I accept that that is a bigger issue.

<A NAME = "10227-16_para15"></a>The Minister recited many details to establish the competitiveness of the UK economy, including lower regulatory burdens compared with those in other countries. I do not deny that, but that advantage has been eroded in recent years. All of the surveys carried out by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Institute of Directors, the Confederation of British Industry and the British Chambers of Commerce constantly refer to the rising tide of regulation and the associated increasing costs. That was the motive behind my amendment. However, I accept that it is part of a larger issue and I shall not test the opinion of the House. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="10227-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>   moved Amendment No. 24:

("( ) any local authority").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10227-17_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 26.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-17_para2"></a>Amendment No. 24 seeks to establish whether local authorities should be paid for operating the Bill's proposals and, if so, how much they should be paid. In Committee, the Minister discussed that and was courteous enough to write to me subsequently setting out details of the Government's weekly benefits savings anti-fraud incentive scheme and of the new anti-fraud incentive scheme. The first of those schemes involves a sliding scale, which changes depending on how much fraud the local authority prevented. However, it also imposes penalties on local authorities if they fail to meet individual thresholds by 75 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-17_para3"></a>Our debate in Committee revealed considerable differences between the position of central government and that of the Local Government Association as regards the extent of the payment. The LGA has also written to me since the Bill's Committee stage. It continues to maintain that the support that central government give to local authorities in terms of housing benefit administration is inadequate and meets less than two-thirds of actual costs. It also points out that "the current incentive regimes" are not "sufficient" to meet the costs of tackling fraud and are ineffective. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Resources are insufficient and notice of funding is frequently given far too late to meet the local authority's budget cycle".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-17_para4"></a>
That is obviously an important consideration because it affects whether the scheme is likely to be operated with the degree of determination that noble Lords would wish. The LGA also states that the shortfall that results from the way in which central government allocate funds to local authorities means that any funding has to be made up through council tax. Those are the reasons why it feels that the Bill's proposals are not compatible with a reasonable and equitable approach to the problem that the Bill seeks to address. The LGA is also concerned about the extent to which the so-called "two strikes and you're out" provisions <P>


<a name="column_1178"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>might within three years have important implications for local authorities if specific benefits were withdrawn and the burden fell on local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I take the noble Lord's first point about subsidy arrangements and I shall return to it. His second point was that local authorities feel that a burden will fall on them if benefits are withdrawn. Which bodies does he have in mind? People for whom a local authority has responsibility under housing legislation because they are vulnerable will have, almost by definition, only a partial arrangement involving either 20 per cent or 40 per cent of their personal allowance. They cannot therefore be left without benefit. The same definition of vulnerability applies to local authorities that have the relevant responsibilities and to those who are protected by the hardship regime under the DSS. I hope that the noble Lord can help me--I absolutely do not understand this point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, that may make two of us!
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-17_para5"></a>My understanding is that the view of local authorities is that if a benefit is withdrawn under the "two strikes and you're out" principle, as set out in the provisions, the costs would have to be covered in another way. Unfortunately, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, who is expert in these matters, is no longer in the Chamber.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-17_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord's argument is not possible. Local authorities have responsibility under housing legislation and under social services legislation. Under housing legislation they have an obligation to house someone if he or she becomes homeless only if he or she is vulnerable. Anyone who is vulnerable is also protected by the hardship schemes that operate under the "two strikes and you're out" principle. In terms of social services, local authorities have a responsibility to intervene only when people are vulnerable through ill-health or disability--they may be an ex-prisoner--or if there are dependants and children. Those people are protected by the hardship clauses. There is not an overriding responsibility on local authorities; a path by which local authorities can pay money to single individuals who have no benefit does not exist. If people are vulnerable, they are protected under the DSS and the vulnerable are the responsibility of local authorities. I do not understand this point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I am stuck between two groups, both of which are obviously expert. As I understand it, local authorities argue that in some cases the local authority may have a homeless duty. If the applicant is deemed to be vulnerable, the local authority will not be able to recover the costs of rehousing the applicant. If the applicant has dependants who are likely to suffer hardship, social services authorities may also have to provide assistance. The Government have given no indication of the fact that they will reimburse local authorities for those additional costs.
<P>


<a name="column_1179"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-17_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, housing benefit is not affected by the Bill; it is not a sanctionable benefit. People cannot therefore become homeless in this regard even if they were cheating with regard to their housing benefit. The deductions would come from JSA or income support, not housing benefit. Therefore, people cannot become homeless because housing benefit would not have been  withdrawn. There may be a profound misunderstanding in this context.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, local authorities will doubtless read our exchanges and the Minister's arguments and we shall see whether they come back to us. A similar situation arose in Committee, when the view of local authorities seemed to be at variance with that expressed by the Minister. They have come back to us about the extent to which there is a deficit with regard to meeting the relevant costs. Members of the House and local authorities should consider the Minister's comments. In the light of those further considerations we should carry out further consultations. I shall go into the matter in greater depth and consider how we might resolve what appears to be a conflict of understanding in this regard between the Minister and local authorities. Having said that, if she would spell out her response to my other points, we could take the matter further at a later stage. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-17_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am baffled by the noble Lord's argument. The concept of vulnerability, for which, as I said, local authorities take responsibility, affects precisely those groups of people for whom a hardship scheme is in place under the DSS. The relevant situation should not therefore arise. Housing benefit cannot be taken away if someone is on income support or JSA, which is a hardship benefit. It can be touched only if a person is not on income support or JSA, in which case he or she would have other sources of income. I do not understand this part of the argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-17_para6"></a>I return to the first part of the noble Lord's argument. Essentially, the basis of his case was that the level of subsidy provided to local authorities was insufficient. We may have to disagree in this regard. I understand that local authorities may seek additional funding. In their place, I did exactly the same. However, they could not say that we have behaved unreasonably. We have increased the sums available to local authorities for the next three years.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-17_para7"></a>The increase for 2000 to 2001 is 2.5 per cent in line with inflation, but the housing benefit case-load has decreased by approximately 6 per cent. That recognises that local authorities have transferred some of the housing stock to housing associations and that housing benefit cases now may be more complex. Local authorities have received increased resources in line with inflation to meet a reduced case- load. This can be probed further with the local authorities. I agree that it will not be even across the country. I have the statistics for each local authority's subsidy <P>


<a name="column_1180"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arrangements should the noble Lord wish to pursue it, including that for Wandsworth. From my knowledge of local government, these seem reasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-17_para8"></a>It was mentioned that local authorities may be under pressure because we are changing the subsidy arrangements which provide an incentive for them to detect fraud. We are changing the arrangement from the weekly verification scheme to the new verification framework. The changes will increase the emphasis on awareness, prevention and prosecution as well as detection and increase the incentive to prevent and detect fraud. The change is from April 2001. Precisely because local authorities said that they were under pressure to make these changes in the time-scale envisaged, we have agreed that they can continue to use their current scheme until April 2002 if they wish. We have a one-year transitional period that they can choose. Many local authorities are seeking to start the new scheme straightaway because they agree with us that in the long term it will be more advantageous for them to do so. Those local authorities not fully geared up have another year.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-17_para9"></a>I believe that we have met the concerns of the local authorities. I realise that these concerns were raised by the noble Lord in Committee. I thought that I had replied by letter and sought to address them. Understandably, local authorities have come to him and said that they are not satisfied.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-17_para10"></a>On the point about local authorities' responsibilities for those who might become homeless, I do not understand that argument from my experience. They are welcome to come back to us on the subsidy arrangement. It may be that we have to agree to disagree. I can understand local authorities wishing to augment their revenues. From the information I have it seems that they have been treated reasonably and fairly, particularly in terms of the overlap of one year in moving on to the new verification framework. I hope that in the light of that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME = "10227-18_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have pursued this matter with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, for some years. It relates to the documentation that local authorities use for housing benefit claims and operations in the housing benefit scheme. It seems to be extraordinarily diverse. Some documentation is a great deal better and more helpful in preventing fraud than other kinds. There does not seem to be any argument for different local authorities using significantly different forms. This amendment suggests that the Secretary of State, or relevant Minister, shall revise and review the current documentation and that a standard system should be employed which is specifically designed by the department to ensure that the commitments and statements made, perhaps with reference to national insurance numbers, may be as appropriate as possible for this purpose. I do not understand why there is diversity. No doubt, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, can tell us why or alternatively accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-18_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the short answer as to why there is diversity is history. The amendment seeks to introduce a standard claim form for housing benefit to be used by all authorities. Currently, local authorities have some freedom to produce forms to suit their own circumstances within the framework of legal requirements. They are also expected to follow good practice guidelines issued by the department. This freedom has some advantages.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-18_para13"></a>We accept that the forms used could be improved. We have already done something about it. It was clear that my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Social Security, was aware of the noble Lord's amendment even though I was not until this morning. The Secretary of State was very concerned about it and it has dominated his thoughts over the recent Recess. The Secretary of State is issuing a new model claim form today. It has been developed by the Benefits Fraud Inspectorate as part of its work to help local authorities improve administration. It gives local authorities a standard from which to work and a bench-mark of good practice both in terms of design and content. We believe that this model will help local authorities to produce better claim forms that will be more efficient for them and easier for tenants to complete.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-18_para14"></a>So we share the spirit of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. But we do not go as far as his amendment, which seeks to impose this form on local authorities. Let me explain why.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-18_para15"></a>First, the cost of doing so would be considerable. In order to comply, every local authority would need to reprogram their computer systems--they all have different computer systems--so that the information could be input in the order and in the format set out on the model. In many cases that would be an unnecessary diversion of resources and wasteful.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-18_para16"></a>Secondly, there is of course the interrelationship with council tax benefit. In some authorities housing and council tax benefits are administered separately and in others they are administered together. That <P>


<a name="column_1183"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>determines whether or not the claim form is designed to capture information for both benefits at the same time. We can therefore respect the need for some local flexibility to cater for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-18_para17"></a>Thirdly, many local authorities add additional sections to the housing benefit claim forms to gather extra information for other benefits for poorer residents--for example, for school uniforms or council nursery places. A national claim form would mean that local authorities would have to issue supplementary forms either with the housing benefit form or after receiving the housing benefit form back. That again could lead to delays or waste of costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-18_para18"></a>For those reasons we do not believe that a statutory standard claim form is the way forward at the moment. As I said, the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate developed a model claim form which is in the process of being issued to local authorities along with general guidance on good design of claim forms. That has been developed in full consultation with those authorities and we fully expect it to be used as the minimum standard. Of course the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate will continue to monitor the standard of claim forms in its visits.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-18_para19"></a>Finally, we are making further and much needed changes to the claims process. As part of our modernisation programme we are developing a single claims process for income support, JSA allowance and incapacity benefit, which will also capture and transfer to local authorities information for assessing housing benefit claims. For people of working age it is intended that initial information for claims be gathered over the phone; any evidence subsequently provided will be verified for the purposes of all related claims, and that should prevent some of the duplication which is at the moment taking place and which is wasteful.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-18_para20"></a>I hope as a result that those people who need to claim a variety of benefits will receive an integrated service because they will be using integrated claims forms in the procedures. For those people claiming just housing benefit, our model claim form will enable local authorities to improve and enhance the service they give. It may be, as local authorities re-tool their computer systems, so they will gradually take over the model claim form and it will become a common basis of usage across the wide range of local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-18_para21"></a>I hope in the light of that response we indicate that we are addressing some of the concerns raised by the noble Lord--issuing a model claim form and encouraging local authorities, where appropriate, to take it up. However, we do not believe it is appropriate at this stage to deny them the flexibility that they have to use the forms for other purposes as well, such as council tax benefit and take-up campaigns of various sorts to identify various forms of need such as council nursery places.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-18_para22"></a>We are therefore treading a line with the consent and support of local authorities, which I hope the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will feel he is able to respect and which will enable him to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="10227-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for that illuminating reply. I do not propose to go into the business of managing local authorities' housing benefit--I suspect I am not well qualified to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para0"></a>Nonetheless, it is important that we go as far as possible towards standardisation. As the noble Baroness said, it may be that a specific local authority wants to acquire other information and retain a degree of flexibility. I felt that that could have been met by having a standardised first part of the form and a less standardised part for a degree of flexibility. At any rate, the fact that a model form is being produced is a step forward. I find it extraordinary that the situation was allowed to develop in the first place.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para1"></a>Computerisation raises some issues with regard to the extent to which it will be possible to cross-reference to detect whether some of the other data we have been discussing on the earlier clauses can be checked against the local authority organisation if, as I understand the Minister correctly, there are a vast variety of different computer systems. However, I understand the Minister's reply reflects a realistic appraisal of the problems involved in this area and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "10227-19_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I hope the Minister will confirm that I have today, on the whole, tried to be helpful where I can. One cannot do it everywhere. Unfortunately what is for us the major issue of the Bill has arisen rather too late in the day to be given the treatment to which at other times it might have been appropriate. That is the question of Clause 6 and the benefit sanctions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para6"></a>It is clear to everybody, no matter from which point of view they approach the issue, that where there is a prohibition there must be a penalty; where there must be a penalty, that penalty must be made as effective as can appropriately be possible. But the word "appropriately" cannot altogether be left out. One wants the penalty to be sufficient to deter. But there are penalties--one reads of such things in other places--which are not merely of a level to deter, but of a far greater level.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para7"></a>It is an assumption that legislators tend to make rather too easily that there is a level of penalty which is sufficient to deter which nevertheless stops short of real savagery. It is not in all cases axiomatic that that is necessarily so. One tries to make it the case where possible. But one should not take it for granted, a priori, that it will be.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para8"></a>The level of sanctions here, we are told, is not to be above 40 per cent and is to exclude housing benefit. But careful questioning by the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee brought out that in a limited <P>


<a name="column_1185"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>number of cases, where there are overlapping sanctions, the level of sanction could reach as high as 80 per cent. That is a quite draconian level of significance.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, commented on this matter in his report and in Committee--I have read everything that was said there; I apologise for being unable to be present. I found I was answered fairly thoroughly long before I was able to make an appearance and was therefore able to do a degree of preparation I might not otherwise have been able to do. The noble Lord, Lord Grabiner, said that these sanctions are well established in social security law. As I remember, he quoted the Jobseekers Act. He is correct. He may not know that all those he mentioned I opposed when they were introduced, and most of them the Minister equally opposed when they were introduced. The Minister remembers the Jobseekers Act well enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para10"></a>The fact that it has been done before, does not mean in my case at least that there is any continuing consent; in fact there is a continuing dissent. A large number of issues are involved which have never been argued out; have never been resolved; and no evidence has been brought to bear on them. The Minister, speaking in Committee, clearly found my view of the effect of sanctions altogether incredible. Indeed, to borrow her phrase, she said that, on the effect of sanctions on those who suffer them, we are living in different worlds.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para11"></a>The virtue I will claim here is that I am prepared to have a commission to research and ascertain which of us is living in the real world; or indeed if neither of us is--which is always a possibility--and in what proportions our worlds are mixed when we come to reality. That seems to me to be a perfectly proper academic curiosity. I have not yet seen in anything done, either by this Government or the last, an equal curiosity to arrive at the truth.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para12"></a>The Minister's difficulty here--indeed, the difficulty of the whole of the Department of Social Security--is that when we consider the existing levels of benefit, particularly of income support, they are suffering from delusions of adequacy. I have already quoted the assumption of most public bodies that any public money voted for a specific purpose is tautologically adequate to the purpose for which it is voted. That is not necessarily so. The levels of social security benefit were calculated by Beveridge in 1948 off research dating from pre-war sources. The chance that that level, uprated automatically in line with inflation between now and 1948, will meet what it genuinely costs to subsist in safe poverty is astronomically small. Prices go up but they do not go up in a uniform scale, so the effect on different points in the social security scale can be very different.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para13"></a>Many people in rural England now spend 10 per cent of their benefit simply travelling to the necessary place to collect it. That is largely a result of bus deregulation. That is only one example; I do not believe that it is unique. As a matter of urgency we need to arrive at a new picture of how much benefit is <P>


<a name="column_1186"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>necessary to support good health. The view of the Acheson report that the level of income support is too low to be compatible with good health is not by itself conclusive but I believe that it is one to which we should pay a good deal of attention. We should put some effort into finding how true that is. If the whole level is insufficient to maintain good health and we start shaving off parts from something which already risks being below a minimum, we may create considerable difficulties.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para14"></a>That is my basic reasoning for thinking that the effects of benefit disentitlement on the scale we are considering here are likely to be a good deal more severe than the Minister thinks. The Minister shakes her head; I am sure I shall hear why. I shall listen with a great deal of interest. We need to take seriously the arguments for finding a level of minimum income. My party policy, on which we shall go into the next election, is that we believe we should commission research to find out what is now a minimum income necessary to maintain good health.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para15"></a>I recall when that proposition was put in an amendment to the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill by the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester. He made an extremely powerful and persuasive case. It ruffled a good many administrative feathers in government circles. To me, that suggests the word "bull's-eye". I think that the noble Lord was right, and the irritation he caused was evidence of his rightness.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para16"></a>When we have a benefit level which is clearly sufficient to maintain good health, we would be in a position to have sanctions which take it down to the level that will maintain good health and no lower. It is when we start to take benefits below that level that we get into trouble. That would either provoke ill health, which is not conducive to returning to work, or would create a temptation to illegal action, which may be serious.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para17"></a>Part of my complaint about the whole regime of benefit sanctions is that we have absolutely no idea on what scale either of those processes operates, if, indeed, at all. If the problem is as trivial as the Minister believes, the research would surely show that I am wrong. I am prepared to take that risk. Is the Minister prepared to take it equally?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para18"></a>The Minister argues that the sample arrived at under the Bill would be too small for serious research. That is a point which can be taken perfectly seriously. On the other hand, I am sure that she does not think I would object if she were to enlarge the research sample to take in people deprived of benefit under other benefit sanctions. At present I do not see any prima facie reason for supposing that benefit sanctions for one reason are likely to create more hardship than equally severe benefit sanctions for another reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para19"></a>If I were to see any reason to suspect that, I would be perfectly ready to investigate it. If a larger sample were to show one sanction causing more hardship than another, I would be prepared to look at it further, as I am sure the department would also. But enlarging the sample--I have not demanded that in Amendment <P>


<a name="column_1187"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>No. 39, to which I think we might with convenience speak in this group--would not create severe problems. If that is the Minister's problem, I do not see why she should not do it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para20"></a>If we are to have a sanctions regime--there has to be some way of punishing people on benefit and we have not yet found a satisfactory one--minimum income entitlement would necessarily be part and parcel of the same package. But if we do not have one, I do not see how we shall justify the other. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, I have no difficulty in supporting about 90 per cent of the comments made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell. He has been addressing the question of the level of social security benefits and a minimum income level, which I could probably argue about a great deal. However, the Bill is about social security fraud. Whatever level the social security benefits are at, fraud would still be a problem which we would have to tackle.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para21"></a>It seems to me that we are all opposed to social security fraud and each and every one of us would want to see it reduced, if not totally eliminated. Perhaps the best way to do that is to prevent fraud taking place, but we know that that is not possible; nothing whatever is perfect. What happens here is that anyone who deliberately commits a social security fraud will be subjected to sanction. However, the Government recognise that there are vulnerable people in that respect. Therefore, measures are being taken. There is an opportunity to receive reduced benefit in such circumstances. The sanction will last for only 13 weeks.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-19_para22"></a>This attack is on the people who commit the abuse deliberately. Although we might talk of measures being draconian, the people who commit the abuse and bring about fraud need sanctions which they have to observe. They must be ones which they can feel; ones which will be a deterrent and may prevent them from attempting the fraud in the first place. It does not seem to me that the amendments do anything like that. I think that the Government have it just about right, if we are to punish people who commit fraud deliberately. We know that fraud involving billions of pounds takes place every year.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I very much agree with my noble friend Lord Davies of Coity. Last year around 10,000 people were prosecuted for benefit fraud. The vast majority of those who were caught did not go on to re-offend, but there is a small minority who do, despite being punished by the courts. It is those persistent benefit offenders who are being targeted by this sanction.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para0"></a>I think that the noble Earl was running two arguments. One is that if benefits were sufficiently generous, or certainly far more generous than they are currently, he would have less difficulty with sanctions because sanctions would then only reduce those benefits to a more acceptable level. That is an argument about the relativity of benefits to wages and the like. We can discuss that on other occasions. The other implication of his remarks was that these are <P>


<a name="column_1188"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people who have fallen into hardship, for whom it is not unreasonable to commit benefit fraud and therefore any sanction that follows alongside it should be as light as possible but noticeable.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-20_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, did the Minister hear me at any moment say anything that suggested it was not unreasonable that they should commit benefit fraud?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   No, my Lords, but given their straitened circumstances it was suggested that the sanctions should be as light as humanly possible, because otherwise they might get into further hardship. All requirements to see the effect of the sanctions are posited on the belief that the sanctions will produce such states of hardship, and so on, as would be unacceptable in the eyes of the noble Earl. That is as I understand it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para1"></a>Under the current system--though people may disbelieve this outside--this hard core of repeat offenders can continue to receive benefit as if nothing had happened and, if they were stealing from the till and were discovered, as if nevertheless they could continue to work as a cashier. Everyone would think this was inappropriate and wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para2"></a>We estimate that about 5 per cent of those who are successfully prosecuted end up back in court for benefit fraud. These are not inadequate people; they are not people who have a disability, a learning difficulty or other problems. They are people who are deliberately, knowingly and fraudulently cheating the system, as established by the courts, not once but more than that. We are talking, for example, of people like the disc jockey who fraudulently claimed incapacity benefit for two separate periods at a cost of £9,000. There was also the man who was prosecuted once for working while claiming and then again for stealing and cashing a relative's child benefit book. Undeterred, he was prosecuted yet again for attempting to claim JSA to which he was not entitled.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para3"></a>These people are claiming benefit to which they are not entitled, primarily because they have other sources of income already, such as being in work. One claimant was successfully prosecuted in February 1994 for two offences related to girocheque fraud and sentenced to three months in prison. He was prosecuted a second time in September 1996, again for cashing girocheques belonging to other people, and again received a custodial sentence. He was prosecuted a third time in December 1998, this time for working while in receipt of incapacity benefit. The overpayment was about £130, and so he had to serve a period of community service.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para4"></a>This is what we are dealing with. We are not dealing with inadequate people in straitened circumstances; we are dealing with people who have more than once been found guilty by the courts of deliberately and knowingly--not innocently or erroneously--cheating the system. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, will accept that for as long as there has been a benefit system provision has been made to stop or reduce benefit <P>


<a name="column_1189"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where a claimant does not comply with the rules. As far back as the early 'sixties the standard amount by which supplementary benefit--the forerunner of income support--was sanctioned was 40 per cent of the personal allowance. There was the same provision for 40 per cent of the single person's allowance, and for 20 per cent where pregnancy or serious illness was involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para5"></a>I understand the concern of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, about basic minimum standards, below which there may be difficulties for the person concerned. Therefore, this sanction has a safety net for the vulnerable, which provides a minimal level of support for the offender and any dependant, where they have no other resources to fall back on. There could be a reduction of benefit, as I have described, which works out at £10 or nearly £21, according to whether a family is involved and to their degree of vulnerability. If the claimant or any one within an assessment unit is seriously ill or pregnant the reduction of £10, the lower rate, would apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para6"></a>In the case of JSA, hardship payments would be made from day one to any family falling into a vulnerable group, which includes those responsible for a child or a young person, where someone is disabled or where the claimant or partner is pregnant, is a carer, or suffers from a chronic medical condition. In other cases anyone on JSA would be able to claim hardship payments not from day one but from the 15th day. For those on income support the same rules relating to the seriously ill or pregnant would apply to the amount of deduction.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para7"></a>Obviously the sanction does not remove an underlying entitlement to JSA or income support, and housing benefit and council tax benefit remain in full payment. This mirrors the hardship payment and benefit reduction schemes that are already in place in other sanction regimes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para8"></a>By restricting, as the amendment would do, the level of any benefit sanction to just 10 per cent of the single person's allowance--£5.25 rather than £10.50--I believe we would be saying that we view this offence of twice knowingly and deliberately committing fraud as certified by the courts to be less serious than those who are currently sanctioned with 20-40 per cent for failing to attend a job interview, or for giving up work voluntarily and who do not appear to be seeking work. In other words, at the moment we sanction 20 per cent or 40 per cent failures or offences done for the first time in some cases which, in most people's eyes, are far less serious than the persistent, knowing and continued fraud that are sanctioned here. That cannot be right.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para9"></a>For any sanction to be effective, we have to combine our concern for those who may be vulnerable with the need to protect the system from those who fail to meet their responsibilities. I do not believe that the amendment would do that. The sanction would last for 13 weeks, after which the benefit would be restored to the rates that would otherwise apply, and throughout this period no reduction would normally apply to housing benefit or council tax benefit.
<P>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1190</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para10"></a>This would mean that for a family of four with two adults and two children they would have £128.50 a week to live on, and the housing costs would be met. For a fit single person aged 25 or more the amount would be £31.30 and the housing costs would be met. I do not think this implies destitution, homelessness and debt. At Committee stage the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, spoke eloquently on behalf of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and I said that we would monitor the effects of the sanction, including its use as a deterrent, together with the effect on an individual's life, including the adequacy and accessibility of hardship payments and together with the effect on specific claimant groups. I also said that we could not pursue the sort of detailed research that the noble Earl has again proposed tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para11"></a>To do so, it would be necessary to see the effect of taking away £10 a week from the benefit level of £200 a week over 13 weeks. One would need to appraise the health of each member of the family before the sanction was imposed; and one would need to check diaries of their food, expenditure and leisure consumption. It would certainly be necessary to survey their housing and the effects of the weather and also intrude on their privacy to find out the resources of family and friends as regards possible subsidy and other sources of support. One would have to work out whether serious illness in one parent or in a child or perhaps in a third member of the family could be attributed to that deduction of £10 from a benefit of £200 over a period of 13 weeks. Other factors would have to be taken into account, such as the length of time the family had already spent on benefit, and also the amount of savings they had. I do not believe that this research, as outlined by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, is possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para12"></a>I come back to my basic argument. These are sanctions imposed only when somebody has knowingly, fraudulently and persistently defrauded the benefits system, and that has been established by the courts. They are in line with the sanctions imposed on offences against the benefits system since the early 1960s and with the rest of other benefit sanctions. We have in play hardship regimes that we think are in line with all the other hardship and benefit regimes that are in place, which have been shown by research on JSA and incapacity benefit to support people while making them realise that we expect the conditions of those benefits to be respected as part of the entitlement to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-20_para13"></a>I know that the noble Earl will not accept my argument but I would say that at the end of the day, under these conditions, IS or JSA would normally be sanctioned either by 20 per cent or 40 per cent of the personal allowance and the benefit for the rest of the family would remain undisturbed. Child benefit will never be withdrawn. Housing benefit and council tax benefit will remain in payment, even when JSA or IS is sanctioned. Premiums payable for the family will not be reduced: only the personal allowance. Free prescriptions and free school meals will remain available, even when a benefit may be sanctioned. <P>

<A NAME="10227-21_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I suppose that the amendment was bound to tempt the Minister into trying to argue that she is against sin and I am not. She has not resisted the temptation. To cut a long argument short, perhaps I may say that where the Bill proposes a six months' sentence of imprisonment, provided I were assured that it was not mandatory I would not oppose it. I believe that we are proposing a somewhat more severe penalty. I know that the Minister does not agree. The noble Baroness heard my arguments about delusion of adequacy as regards the level of income support. I shall repeat them if necessary, but I suspect that the House would rather I did not do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, did I hear the noble Earl correctly? Does he think that 13 weeks' loss of £10 on a benefit of £220, reducing the amount to £210, is harsher than a six months' prison sentence?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-21_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, yes, and I am prepared to consider research to see whether I am wrong. Is the Minister prepared to do the same?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I wonder how many noble Lords in this House believe that a £10 sanction on a benefit of over £200 over 13 weeks is harsher than six months in prison. I do not believe that the proposition deserves substantial research.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-21_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the Minister shows a remarkable lack of curiosity. One of us is wrong. I would rather like to know which of us it is. I am prepared to take the risk of finding out.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para0"></a>The next trap that the Minister fell into was that she listed, very properly, cases of social security fraud which are clearly grossly credible. They were almost all people who were already working--for example, a disc jockey. Those people in law, properly, have no benefit entitlement anyway. So a social security benefit sanction takes away from them what they should never have had in the first place. As Gibbon would put it, it <P>


<a name="column_1192"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>robs them of a superfluous treasure. It is a most inappropriate sanction because it bites on something that those individuals should not have anyway.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para1"></a>If we are dealing with real criminals, people to whom benefit should never have been awarded--even if we are thinking in the pure, narrow terms of deterrence--benefit sanctions are not the appropriate penalty. Some more ordinary criminal penalty would in those cases be a good deal more appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para2"></a>The Minister trotted through a great deal of material about hardship payments to vulnerable people. If one is on a means-tested benefit and that benefit is rightly awarded--we must assume that that benefit is not allowed by the Treasury to be significantly above what is needed to live on--how can one then be deprived of any substantial part of it without being in hardship? I have asked this House before why single people can never be presumed under benefit rules to be in hardship. I have never had an answer. I shall continue to ask the question because one day I should like to hear an answer. It sounds like a somewhat perverse form of family values.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para3"></a>Any punishment must create hardship. I would like that hardship to be such that it does not leave the person beyond the point of recovery--it does not drive him into either illegal courses which may leave him with a long-term drug dependency or in the grip of a drug dealer, or in a state of ill health such that he cannot return to work. That is a degree of moderation which one may legitimately expect of the criminal law in any circumstances. Beyond that point, it becomes self defeating.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para4"></a>I turn to the Minister's difficulties about research. We all know that when the Whitehall machine sets out to prove that some matter is difficult it can do so very well indeed. If we have a sufficient control group with which to compare these people, I do not envisage that every single detail about the area and the weather for which the Minister asks will be necessary. The Minister seeks to make matters more difficult than they need be. It is an art in which any good Minister--as the noble Baroness is--is skilled. I do not take the argument that seriously. But meanwhile the clock is ticking away. We have had the argument previously; we shall have it again. We shall hear the argument during the election. So, ready for the next round, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "10227-21_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 33 had originally been grouped with Amendment No. 34.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para10"></a>In Committee I undertook to consider further the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Astor, regarding the treatment under these provisions of an absolute discharge or probation order in Scotland. As the noble Lord will recall, the legal system in Scotland and in England and Wales differs somewhat on the labelling of offences. But I am sure the House will agree that social security legislation has to be consistent across both countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para11"></a>As I said in Committee, the key point at issue here is whether or not a court has found a person guilty of fraud against the benefit system. The purpose of this amendment is to put that principle beyond doubt. The effect of the amendment is to specify that any case where a court in Scotland makes a probation order is treated as a conviction as regards these provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, was correct in saying that where a court in Scotland grants an absolute discharge or makes a probation order it is not treated as a conviction because this is what the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 provides. However, the position in England and Wales differs in that while the granting of an absolute discharge is similarly deemed not to be a conviction, any case where a court makes a probation order is a conviction.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para13"></a>The social security system applies to Great Britain as a whole. I am sure that your Lordships would agree that claimants should be able to expect the same treatment whether they live in Scotland or in the rest of Great Britain. It would be unfair to sanction a person in England or Wales on the basis that he had committed two benefit frauds, one of which had attracted a probation order, but not to sanction a person who had committed identical frauds in Scotland and received identical sentences.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>   moved Amendment No. 42:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 18, line 29, at end insert ("and, in addition, an amount which is 32 times the weekly cost of the benefit which was defrauded by each employee").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-21_para27"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para28"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in Committee we debated the question of what penalties should be imposed on colluding employers whose actions resulted in social security fraud. Generally speaking, the feeling on this side of the House is that the proposals with regard to measures to combat organised fraud are significantly less and less effective than proposals to combat individual fraud.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para29"></a>In Committee we suggested that the penalty on employers who were colluding in fraud with their employees should reflect the fact that substantial amounts of money might have been lost to the Exchequer, in particular in relation to employees drawing benefits to which they were not entitled. Somewhat to my astonishment, the Minister expressed horror that any colluding employer should suddenly become liable for the consequences of his action. She suggested that that might put the employer out of business and was unduly severe. Therefore, taking, as always, the views of the Minister into account, I have tabled a more moderate amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para30"></a>Amendment No. 42 suggests that the penalty that a colluding employer should incur, in addition to that set out in the Bill, should be 32 times the weekly cost of the benefit defrauded by each employee. Your Lordships may be puzzled why the figure is 32 times the weekly cost of the benefit defrauded. It is based on the proposal which applies to local government when it adopts an incentive scheme to stop fraud. That seems a not unreasonable proposal. It may be the case that a particular employer employs perhaps 20 or 30 individuals, all of whom are drawing benefits fraudulently. If that is so, the penalty of 32 times the amount of money lost to the Exchequer as a result of the fraud is not an unreasonable penalty to impose.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-21_para31"></a>So I have taken into account the views, and, indeed, the reaction, which the Minister put forward, but it seems to us that a significant penalty should be imposed on employers. The overall effect of the collusion between employers and employees may be significant but both groups of people have an option. They do not have to commit the fraud. Furthermore, the employer does not have to go along with a situation where his employees can defraud the taxpayer. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Grabiner: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may make one or two observations about the proposed amendment. The particular attraction about the provision as drafted is its simplicity. It is clearly drafted. It contains nice round figures that would constitute the penalty to be extracted from the offending employer. I suspect that one of the reasons for the simplicity is to encourage employers who are charged or accused of collusion to come to a deal--for want of a better word--pursuant to these provisions. These provisions are designed to achieve a voluntary deal on a civil basis without the need to invoke the criminal process.
<P>


<a name="column_1195"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para0"></a>The first criticism I make of the proposal is that it simply introduces mathematical complication, albeit that the mathematical complication can be explained as it was by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para1"></a>The second point is that the noble Lord need not be concerned that the underlying irritation that drives his amendment cannot already be dealt with under the existing common law. In the kind of fraud we are now discussing, if an employer knowingly participates in a benefit fraud which produces the result that money is stolen or has disappeared in an illegal way and it can be demonstrated that he has the appropriate guilty knowledge, he can be made personally liable as a constructive trustee in the civil courts. There the full extent of the loss sustained by the Exchequer can be recovered. Therefore, the imposition of the penalty, which as I understand it is the real driving force that sits behind the amendment, is not necessary because in a suitable case the DSS could bring proceedings against a colluding employer and recover that money in the civil courts. The proposed amendment therefore is not necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para2"></a>The third point is that the amendment unnecessarily introduces into the existing provision the additional concept of the benefit which was defrauded by each employee. At the moment, the provisions in Clause 14 do not require proof of fraud against an employee. It requires a colluding employer who has done one or other of the things identified in the provision. The introduction of the amendment would mean that proof of a fraud by each employee would be necessary in order to recover the 32 times figure. That is not currently required in order to operate Clause 14. The amendment adds an unnecessary complication. That goes back to my first point about simplicity. It would make it unmanageable and complex. I believe that the existing common law position protects the position adequately.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-22_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, would I be right in thinking that calculating the amount of benefit defrauded when some of the attendant circumstances cease to be the case might be a good deal of work?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I believe so, my Lords. The purpose of Clause 14 is to streamline the lengthy and expensive process of prosecuting collusive employers. It introduces a single fixed penalty for the small-time offender, thereby enabling the department to focus limited prosecution resources on the more serious cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para3"></a>As my noble friend Lord Grabiner explained, the effect of the amendment would be to increase the amount of the penalty in circumstances where the employer's act of collusion results in an overpayment of benefit. In addition to the fixed penalty of between £1,000 and £5,000 already provided in the clause, the penalty would also include an amount equivalent to 32 times the weekly cost of the benefit which was defrauded by each employee. As the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said, the amendment would not only be extremely complicated but would hike up the amount of the penalty considerably, depending on the type of benefits stolen.
<P>


<a name="column_1196"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1196</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para4"></a>The clause already reflects the maximum penalty that a court might impose were the employer prosecuted and convicted. As I said in Committee, the majority of small time offenders at which the penalty is aimed are currently prosecuted for giving false information. In those circumstances, the maximum fine a court could impose would be at level 3 or level 5, which carry maximum penalties of £1,000 and £5,000 respectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para5"></a>An additional amount suggested by these amendments, which relates to the amount of putative benefit lost, would be likely to take the total amount of the penalty above that which a court could apply. This would essentially remove any incentive for an employer to agree to the penalty, undermining the purpose of the clause, which is to punish small time offenders without going through the process of a lengthy and expensive prosecution. It would also mean that the penalty agreed under such a process by administrative arrangement could and would be higher than the maximum amount that the court would be entitled to impose. Again, I do not think that that necessarily would be appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para6"></a>I understand the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that any penalty should include a means of recovering the amount of funds that have been defrauded. However, we already do this. Where there is an overpayment of benefit that is attributable to the claimant, we recover the loss directly from that individual, which is in line with the Scampion report. We do not seek to change that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para7"></a>However, linking it to the size of the overpayment would be unreasonable in that the weekly amount of benefit defrauded is not determined by the employer's action--although I accept that he may have contributed to it--but by the personal circumstances of the employees involved. Although the employer may have assisted in the fraud, he cannot be held responsible for an employee's age--certain benefits are age related--or his domestic situation--he may be claiming on behalf of a partner and children--which could result in certain benefits being claimed. For example, based on the benefit rates from April 2001, it could mean that an employer alleged to have colluded in fraud with a 25 year-old employee who is single and claiming JSA would be offered a penalty of £1,000 and an additional amount of £1,697. The total amount of the penalty would be a little under £3,000. However, if the same individual had a partner and two children, the total amount of the penalty would amount to £4,800. The amount of penalty would fluctuate not according to what the employer had done, but according to the circumstances of the employee, over whom the employer has no control.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para8"></a>The employer's offence is to tell a lie at a specific point in time in relation to his employees. We will get at that, so to speak, by offering a penalty in lieu of a court case. It is very difficult to tie the individual employee's overpayment to the employer because the employer is unlikely to know what benefit they receive. The employer may lie to fraud investigators in respect of one employee's hours of work or amount of wages, which would constitute an offence, but that does not <P>


<a name="column_1197"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mean that the employer is responsible for the size of the employee's family, for the length of time that the employee has been making claims, or even the rate at which benefits were paid.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para9"></a>While I agree that the employer is culpable because he colluded in the fraud in the first instance, the amount of benefit defrauded is not a direct responsibility of his action, although it is consequential on it. The benefits stolen and particularly the total amount defrauded are linked to the claimant's age, his domestic circumstances, for how long he claims and what benefits he claims.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para10"></a>I hope that, on reflection, the noble Lord will agree that this is unfair. The same offence committed by an employer would result in very different penalties being imposed, according to the circumstances of the employee. It could also lead the employer to being vulnerable or liable to administrative penalties higher than those which the courts could impose. Again, that would be unfair. Finally, it would be perfectly reasonable for the employer to choose not to opt for the process of negotiating an administrative penalty--out of a preference not to have a criminal conviction on his record--but would instead revert to the old court system, which would introduce the familiar delays and difficulties of establishing guilt. We would not achieve our aim; namely, to take smaller offences out of court proceedings. In the light of this explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, the amendment seems to have provoked a lively set of arguments, which I should like to take fully into account, in particular the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Grabiner. It is true to say that if such cases go through the normal legal process, they are likely to incur far heavier penalties. We are concerned here with the alternative form of penalty. I take also the point that it might be complicated and difficult to show exactly how much money the Exchequer has lost as a result of various employees seeking to exploit the collusion of the employer.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para11"></a>Having said that, I am not sure, from a purely logical point of view, that I agree entirely with what has been said by the noble Baroness. While it is true to say that the loss to the Exchequer will depend on how many employees engage in the fraud and which benefits they seek to claim, it is nevertheless the case that, if the employer had not colluded, the fraud would not have taken place and the amount, however much it may be, would not have been lost to the Exchequer. I have a little difficulty in agreeing with the argument that the amount lost is somehow independent of the fact that collusion had taken place. If there had been no collusion, then no loss would have been incurred.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-22_para12"></a>However, I should like to consider the matter further. I remain unhappy at the balance struck between the main criminal penalty and the alternative penalty. I should like to think on that between now and Third Reading.

<A NAME = "10227-23_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-23_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 45 and to speak also to the amendments grouped with it. The amendments deal with two separate issues. The first amendment has been introduced after discussions with Scottish lawyers. I hope that I shall receive a beaming smile from the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, on the grounds that we are doing our best to be helpful. The intention is simply to ensure that the offences are comparable both north and south of the Border, allowing for the differences between our respective legislatures.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-23_para2"></a>The second issue is to ensure that the responsibilities in Clause 15 to report changes of circumstances extend to those who receive benefit on behalf of benefit claimants as well as to claimants themselves and to third parties. In doing this, we have taken the opportunity to make clear the particular responsibilities placed on landlords who receive rent direct in the form of housing benefit to which their tenant is entitled. Their responsibilities are related to changes pertaining to the claimant's occupation of the dwelling for which the housing benefit is paid.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-23_para3"></a>Clause 15 provides for two separate offences. One is the summary offence of failing to notify a change of circumstances which the individual knows will affect his benefit. The other is more serious and attracts a greater penalty commensurate with the offence. I could set out the detail of these differences but, given the hour, perhaps noble Lords will accept that originally, Scottish lawyers thought that we might be able to rely on the existing drafting. On further reflection, it was considered better to use the term "knowingly". The terms "dishonestly" and "knowingly" are used in the present versions of these offences in order to respond to the concerns expressed by the Scottish Law Society and to reflect the different approaches of the two criminal law systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-23_para4"></a>This amendment seeks to "tidy up" the legislation in response to consultation and correspondence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-23_para5"></a>Perhaps I may turn now to the subsequent amendments. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that those who receive benefit on behalf of claimants are held responsible for reporting changes, as are claimants themselves. We are dealing with two main groups here: appointees and landlords. Because of their different positions in relation to the claimant, the Government consider that different conditions should apply and this is reflected in the amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-23_para6"></a>I shall deal first with appointees. These are individuals and organisations who, because of the mental inability of the claimant to act for themselves, are appointed by the Secretary of State to act in the claimant's place. They make the claim, receive the <P>


<a name="column_1199"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>payments and take responsibility for notifying changes of circumstances. Because they are standing in place of claimants, if they act fraudulently, we think that they should be treated in a similar way. For example, if an elderly, incapable lady is admitted into a nursing home and a relative acts for them and then acts fraudulently, we believe that they should be caught by the legislation in the same way.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-23_para7"></a>The second group is landlords who receive their rent in the form of housing benefit paid direct to them, instead of the claimant, by a local authority. If the claimant leaves the address, the claimant himself has a responsibility to notify the local authority and so, too, does the landlord. However, if there is no incentive to do so, then the dishonest landlord could continue to pocket the housing benefit. The existing legislation is vaguely worded and has caused disquiet, in particular among landlords in social housing--for example some housing associations--who are not sure where their liability for "policing" their tenants begins and ends. The amendment aims to make their responsibilities absolutely clear. The changes that the landlord is responsible for reporting are those connected with the tenancy: the tenant's occupancy of the property for which housing benefit is being paid, and his liability to pay rent. I am sure that this will reassure honest social landlords as to what their responsibilities are. I hope that it will also send a clear message to landlords who receive rent direct that, if they continue to enjoy it when they should not, they too are liable for prosecution.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-23_para8"></a>Finally, let me point out once more for the record that the offence in Clause 15 relating to "causing or allowing" a claimant to fail to notify a change of circumstances does not include third parties who merely learn of a change. To become guilty of an offence, a third party would have to be active in some way in the failure. This comes back to the CAB point that some knowledge of that failure is not in itself an offence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-23_para9"></a>I hope noble Lords will agree that, despite the apparent complexity of these amendments, they are in essence a simple replication of the offences so that they apply to third parties under an existing obligation to notify relevant changes in the claimant's circumstances. I hope that the law will now be clarified. I commend the amendments to the House.

<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para3"></a>The purpose of the amendment is simple. Concern has been expressed throughout our debates on the Bill regarding the extent to which the proposals will be operated in a reasonable manner. Concerns remain that there is no external check on that. The amendment seeks to make available an indication of the extent to which the operation of the proposals has turned out to be reasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para4"></a>The crucial item out of the three listed in the amendment is the number of investigations aborted. Clearly, if an enormous percentage of investigations undertaken turn out to be abortive, there is some implication that the reasonableness of the inquiries being started in the first place is in doubt. It would be helpful for us to see how, when the Bill becomes an Act, as I hope and believe it will, it operates in practice. I beg to move.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the amendment seeks to place a statutory duty on each local authority to publish a quarterly report on the numbers of investigations it carries out on the basis of the powers in the Bill, and the proportion of those which are aborted and those which result in some form of punishment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para5"></a>I take the noble Lord's point that this information would provide a form of public accountability on how well local authorities were making use of the powers, and whether they were using them properly. However, I hope to persuade the noble Lord that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para6"></a>I should first point out that he is in error in his assumption that these data would provide a meaningful picture. Local authorities do not "abort" investigations. In line with the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, they carry them through to conclusion, even where the indications are that the investigation is leading to a negative outcome. In that process we would expect there to be a proportion of cases where investigation established that there was no fraud. We would also expect a proportion of cases--though hopefully diminishing with the use of powers in the Bill--where there was insufficient evidence to prove fraud. That is the nature of investigation. Obviously, if we limited ourselves to investigating only those cases where fraud was pretty much a foregone conclusion, we should not make much of a dent in the levels of fraud that we know exist.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para7"></a>We share the understanding that it is very hard to know what counts as success. If a local authority identifies a large amount of fraud, is it because it has let in a large amount earlier in the system which it subsequently detects? If an authority detects a low level of fraud, is it because it has "built out" fraud at early stages? There is no way of knowing from the noble Lord's amendment. Therefore, there is no means of identifying whether a local authority is performing to "best value" standards by nature of the amendment, because we do not know what would count as success or failure. I suggest that that is why, at its core, the <P>


<a name="column_1203"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment is not appropriate. We simply cannot use the number of prosecutions or penalties compared with the number of investigations to indicate either success or failure in terms of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para8"></a>It is also the case that investigators may use any of the full range of powers at their disposal in any one case. While it would obviously be possible to distinguish cases where the new powers were used from those where they were not, it would be hard to draw meaningful conclusions about the effectiveness of the particular powers in which the noble Lord is interested and the powers that already exist-- many of them introduced by the previous administration--and which were being used in addition.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para9"></a>A further point of substance is that we already collect a great deal of information about local authorities' anti-fraud performance for management purposes, which might be a more proper use of such statistics. More generally, I believe that adherence to the code of practice and the commitment on the face of the Bill agreed by your Lordships this evening will ensure that we use the powers properly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para10"></a>We cannot know whether detecting more fraud or detecting less fraud is a priori evidence that the Bill is satisfactory or not as regards local authorities--because that must be balanced against the amount of fraud that we have built out of the system by other parts of our relationship to local authorities in the handling of housing benefit. It therefore seems to me that what we should rightly be focusing on is whether local authorities observe the code of practice. As we discussed earlier, the paragraphs affecting local authorities will come as a result of consultation with them over the next few weeks. We should also focus on a review of that in the light of complaints that we may receive about the effectiveness of local authorities' performance and the appropriateness of the behaviour of their officials.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para11"></a>We have already given your Lordships a commitment that we shall be reviewing the code within three years to ensure that both we and our information providers are happy with the operation of the powers in practice. We plan to do this by means of a report for consultation, which will cover our performance and that of local authorities against the requirements of the code. Plainly this will include information on how we and local authorities have used the powers and how productive they have been compared with expectations. The report will be widely valued and publicly available.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para12"></a>Local authorities are subject to a best value performance indicator on security and accuracy. Reports of performance under best value are already made available to the public. We intend to review that performance indicator to make it more robust. We expect to link it to the new anti-fraud incentive scheme for local authorities that will be phased in from April 2001.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para13"></a>For all those arguments, we cannot meet the noble Lord's request; namely, to determine whether more or fewer prosecutions, more or fewer abortive prosecutions, are an indicator of success or failure. <P>


<a name="column_1204"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, we can get to the substantive point and reward local authorities for detecting fraud and for building fraud out of their system, as well as reviewing the conduct of their officials in how they handle fraud in the light of complaints or any concern and embody that in the code of practice and its reviews over the next three years. In the light of my explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I entirely take the point that if there is an increase in the detection of fraud one is not sure whether that means there is more fraud or more detection. Indeed, I made that point in my opening remarks. I was well aware of the problem when I was Minister with responsibility for Customs & Excise as regards the detection of drugs: one never knew whether it was more drugs coming in or more detection of drugs taking place. The only observation to be made in that context is what is happening to the street price. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding indicator in that respect that one could use as far as concerns the matters now under discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-24_para14"></a>I am seeking to establish to what extent certain enquiries were started which, in the event, ought not to have been instigated. It is possible that the noble Baroness is right in her contention that this is not the ideal way to set about the task. However, the very broad-brush approach that the Minister suggests in terms of a code of conduct, and so on, is perhaps not sufficiently precise an indication of the extent to which those operating the system are, or are not, acting reasonably in initiating particular enquiries. I should like further to consider the matter between now and Third Reading. Clearly it would not be appropriate at this stage to move Amendment No. 53, which adopts the same arguments. Indeed, it would merely delay our proceedings. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<A NAME="10227-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what are their policies on promoting general aviation, including revised planning guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am delighted to be able to speak on general aviation tonight. It is very timely in the light of the two government consultation papers, Noise from Civil Aircraft and The Future of Aviation. I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald of Tradeston, and all the other noble Lords who are taking part tonight. I must also declare that I am a fixed-wing pilot, President of the General Aviation Awareness Council and Vice-President of the Popular Flying Association. Finally, I am presently involved with an industry and parliamentary fellowship with BAE Systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para1"></a>In broad terms, aviation can be split between commercial and non-commercial flying. General aviation (GA) is generally thought to encompass civil aviation other than the commercial air transport sector. The question is whether general aviation is important. Sir Malcolm Field, Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, said in September of last year that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"of all the areas of aviation, it is General Aviation which is the most active and varied, with by far the majority of civil aircraft in the UK falling into that category ... GA is the springboard for many of the world's commercial pilots and a vital industry in its own right. It is imperative that General Aviation is both successful and safe".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-25_para2"></a>
The UK commercial airlines operate about 850 aircraft from 23 UK airports. The UK general aviation fleet comprises more than 10,000 aircraft that operate from around 490 airports, aerodromes and private airstrips. Whereas more than 70 per cent of all GA activity has some business or safety purpose, 85 per cent of all seats sold by airlines are for purposes of holiday travel or personal pleasure.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para3"></a>It should be recognised that a lot of effort goes into ensuring that the needs of the airlines and, therefore, the needs of the travelling public are met. As a result, general aviation has paid a heavy price. GA survival depends on access to airports and airspace; unreasonable restrictions on either can be seriously detrimental to the economic and social welfare of the community, both nationally and locally. Yves Lambert, Director General of Eurocontrol, also said in September of last year that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we all know that General Aviation plays a large role in flying circles. The rather loose term covers many important activities. In Europe alone, I believe there are 300,000 pilots flying over 50,000 GA aircraft with an economic impact of some 5.5 billion Euros ... GA must be taken seriously. Its needs should be met as far as possible; and its hard-won liberties must not be curtailed".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para5"></a>Private aviation plays an important part in the development and the economy of the UK. If we wish to retain and support it, we must be careful not to confuse different principles like the "user pays" with the "beneficiary pays", as different charging regimes will ultimately impact on the overall flexibility of GA. We are deeply concerned that the escalating costs of operating light aircraft in the UK are pushing flying beyond the reach of our younger generation. The country is in danger of losing its strong pool of qualified pilots and its unique place in the world for pilot training and development. Today, 60 per cent of all pilots joining the airlines come from the club and private flying routes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para6"></a>The air-mindedness of our youth today has been seriously eroded over the past 10 to 15 years compared to previous generations. It is suggested that this decline is likely to continue. Aviation is ingrained into people from an early age. They often start off as model aircraft builders, going on to enjoy educational flying in the air cadet corps and university air squadrons. They eventually work in aviation, or, like myself, become a home plane builder in the recreational sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para7"></a>It is worth noting that, although the UK has less than a handful of commercial plane manufacturers--of which BAE Systems is by far the most important--it also has a successful home-build industry, with many plane kit manufacturers. A good example is the much exported Europa aircraft, which could have been seen hanging in the Dome.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para8"></a>Business aviation includes air taxi operations, in which clients charter whole aircraft, and corporate operations in which a company owns and operates its own aircraft using professional pilots. Business aviation provides industry and commerce with speed and flexibility of operation, which the rigid schedules and time-wasting routines of airline travel deny to those who need to travel quickly, cost-effectively and by the most direct routeing. Many of the world's most profitable companies operate their own aircraft for those reasons. There are well over 200 corporately owned aircraft in the UK. The ability to operate out of a nearby airport may be one of the prerequisites to an international company locating its offices and businesses in a certain area.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para9"></a>There are more than 100 air taxi operators in the UK, not only providing regular charter and ad hoc services for business travellers, but a vital part of the overnight mail, business data transportation services and freight services. A number of Ministers use GA to facilitate their busy and demanding schedules, and so they should. Ministers must surely serve their country more efficiently by making best use of their time. Yet if the infrastructure continues to decline, the flexibility of business aviation will diminish and successful businesses will suffer. Countries such as France and the USA are well aware of this.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para10"></a>GA aircraft are also used for police and ambulance services, aerial photography and survey, pipeline and electricity cable patrols, commercial support to <P>


<a name="column_1207"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>military operations, shipping and fishing patrols, coastguard duty, dispersal of coastal oil slicks and for agricultural purposes, not forgetting the eye in the sky helping to keep our roads on the move in our busy cities. Each day GA touches every one of us in some way.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para11"></a>However, the problems for GA are getting worse. More and more regional airports are using pricing policies that deter the small operator. For example, the use of mandatory handling adds substantially to the overall cost. Yet this was never meant to apply to GA operations. In some cases there is no alternative, because smaller aerodromes are closing or have operating restrictions making them difficult to operate to or from.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para12"></a>The future of Gloucester Airport, Rochester, Kemble and Bicester, to name but a few, is in doubt as they are becoming prime locations for housing. Some will become involved in expensive inquiries such as the South Cambridge inquiry, which will cost the local authority £&#189; million. Once an aerodrome facility has been lost, it is extremely unlikely that another great open space for an aerodrome will be utilised to replace it. Yet these landing sites are not looked upon as being of importance to the national economy, let alone local economies. Coupled to this, with airspace problems such as the gradual loss of lower airspace radar service (LARS), what we are witnessing is an over-commercialisation of the nation's infrastructure which is becoming beyond the economic means of GA. This is where the need arises for a national policy with regard to the future of general aviation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para13"></a>As for planning policy guidance, PPG13 is a step in the right direction but, as it is only guidance, local authorities can and do choose to ignore it. The strengthening of PPG13 would give better guidance to local authorities. One hopes it might require them to make statements in their regional and local plans. If one agrees with the argument that airports and airfields are part of our national integrated transport system, perhaps local authorities should be required to follow directions rather than follow the guidance of a strengthened PPG13.

I hope that the noble Lord will regard this evening's debate as part of that consultation process and will take into account the opinions which noble Lords will express in it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para14"></a>I too am an occasional private pilot although not as distinguished as my noble friends who have spoken and who will speak this evening. It is important to start from the premise that the United Kingdom is a world leader in aviation. It is a world leader in terms of airlines, airports and air traffic control. It has an <P>


<a name="column_1208"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extremely important aerospace business. Many of the people who are the backbone of those industries have a background of general aviation. My noble friend mentioned the figure of 65 per cent of airline pilots who have come up through what can only be described as a self-improvement route. They may have started flying as a hobby. They have then taken it further and have spent their own money to improve their qualifications. They have spent much of their resources on training themselves to enter a highly skilled job which is productive to the UK economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para15"></a>I hope that the Minister will support my argument that there is great benefit to the United Kingdom in having a major pool of highly qualified people who can enter the airlines, the military and air traffic control. I understand that many air traffic controllers are also private pilots. That argument has previously been deployed in the context of shipping. I know that previously the noble Lord has recognised the value of having a highly qualified maritime base. The same points apply to aviation. The UK has been a pioneer of the privatisation and the commercialisation of these industries. These models have been followed across the world, first with airlines and then with airports. I am sure--the noble Lord will be more aware of this than I--that all eyes will be on him, his department, the Civil Aviation Authority and NATS itself, when that privatisation occurs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para16"></a>We contend that GA is important. It is important as a freedom for people to exercise their right to fly if they are suitably qualified. It is economically important to have people who can join the important industries I mentioned. Business aviation is, of course, vital to companies who need to move their executives around quickly and who have calculated that the use of executive aircraft is vital to their businesses. Certainly when I was in government I received many representations from firms that wished to locate near to London, within or near to the M25 zone, but were having great difficulty in finding premises that were within sufficient striking range of GA facilities which would allow their senior executives to come and go using business aviation. It is easy to misinterpret that point and to talk about "fat cats". However, if we wish to attract investment into this country, we must consider seriously what these executives demand and what they need. Business aviation is an important part of that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para17"></a>We are seeing some new developments. Financial wags used to say that when the chairman bought an executive jet it was time to fire the chairman. Now I believe that we have passed that point. We now recognise the economic value to corporations of using such aircraft where appropriate. Certainly there are new initiatives such as corporate sharing of aircraft--this is effectively time share--which have made them very much more affordable for corporations. We have also seen the new initiative of Richard Noble's F1 company to develop a whole new range of aircraft to be used in the air taxi field. That is also an exciting initiative.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para18"></a>We are lucky in this country that we have an admirable safety record on GA. However, that is only maintained by having good quality training organisations and extremely efficient safety regulation. I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the safety regulation group of the Civil Aviation Authority. That regulator enjoys the confidence of its industry. That is extremely important to any safety regulator. A pragmatic approach has also been taken to the delegation of authority to other bodies such as the Popular Flying Association, the British Microlight Aircraft Association, the British Gliding Association and others. That is a pragmatic approach which I contend has worked.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para19"></a>When pilots exercise the privileges of their licence they must realise that it is their responsibility to strike a balance between their desire to fly and the desire of people living close by to airports to be able to enjoy a quiet existence. Again, the evidence is that pilots take that extremely seriously. They realise that flying is a privilege and that they must do so in a considerate manner. I invite scrutiny, for example, of the aviation press a great deal of which is devoted towards considerate flying. I also draw attention to the technical diagrams or plates which describe the procedures at any particular airfield, most of which will have special noise considerations built into them to make sure that pilots minimise the disturbance that they cause to other people.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para20"></a>As my noble friend Lord Rotherwick mentioned, in a way aviation has been a victim of its own success. We have seen extraordinary growth in the commercial aviation arena and that has in effect displaced GA from some of the larger airfields. It is an ongoing problem that business operators who wish to operate out of Heathrow, for example, find it extremely difficult to get more than very occasional slots.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para21"></a>The planning regime to which my noble friend refers is extremely important. Planning Policy Guidance Note 13--a draft which was put forward in October--recognises that small airports and aerodromes are important; that they serve business, recreational, training and emergency service needs and that as the demand for commercial air transport grows, GA finds access to larger airports increasingly restricted. In formulating their planned policies and proposals the document states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Local authorities should take account of the contribution of GA to local and regional economies; the national need for pilot training; and the benefits of having suitable facilities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-25_para22"></a>
I welcome all those sentiments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para23"></a>I raise the question of whether the sentiments and policies put forward in PPG 13 are being communicated effectively to local planning authorities. I draw the attention of the House to the paper presented by the General Aviation Awareness Council to the Secretary of State for Transport in February 1999. It pointed out that planning applications for aerodromes had a relatively low success rate yet on appeal the success rate was more than twice the national average. I would be interested to know whether the Government recognise and agree with the council's figures and therefore whether they <P>


<a name="column_1210"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would conclude, as I have done, that perhaps local planning authorities have shown a tendency to make more unsound decisions as regards flying sites than other applications. If there are other explanations of that, this evening would be a good opportunity to discuss them. If that is the case, the next question for the Minister is what action he proposes to take to communicate the guidance more effectively to local planning authorities. I certainly agree that the action already taken to revise the guidance is a step in the right direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para24"></a>My noble friend referred to the lower airspace radar service issue in the course of his speech. We had a very quick run around that course when we had a Starred Question on the issue. But it is extraordinarily difficult, as the Minister and his questioners found, to explain a complex issue within the space of a 20 or 30 second Question.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para25"></a>Let it simply be said that a great deal of aviation activity, both commercial and GA, takes place outside controlled air space and that the LARS service is an important aid to safety, particularly when talking about flying on instruments in adverse meteorological conditions. So I caution the Government, the Civil Aviation Authority and the new operators of NATS, when they take over, to look very carefully at the LARS service and not to forget about the major safety benefit that it brings.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para26"></a>I conclude by stressing the argument that general aviation is important. I urge the Minister not to lose sight of that fact when the Government are considering policy initiatives. One frequently reads in the press of very vocal groups who point the finger at GA, but who do not balance the argument by discussing the important benefits which this activity brings. We cannot afford to regulate or price general aviation out of existence.

<A NAME="10227-25_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, in rising to support my noble friend Lord Rotherwick, I have an interest to declare which, I believe, the two preceding speakers have already done, in that I am a private pilot. That is my only interest. I serve no body within private aviation. But I am delighted that my noble friend Lord Rotherwick has been successful in having this matter debated tonight. It is indeed timely in view of the papers which have already been referred to by previous speakers. It is a subject about which my noble friend knows a great deal, as evidenced by the statistics and the information which he so ably gave the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para27"></a>Above that, the House perhaps may be interested to know that when he referred to himself as a "home plane builder", I hope that I will not embarrass him when I say that he built an absolutely wonderful light aircraft which he has flown to many parts of the world. In 1997 I was privileged to be part of a wing organised by the air squadron which flew 11 light aircraft to the north-eastern reaches of Pakistan, at the invitation of the Pakistan Air Force, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their independence.

<A NAME = "10227-25_para28"></a>Flying in the Himalayas with a multitude of different aircraft types made for some very interesting and unforgettable moments. Before I detain the House with too many stories, perhaps I may say that I am very relieved that both he and I are back here to tell the tale.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para29"></a>General aviation plays an important part in the economy of our nation. Businessmen need to be able to use this means of transport effectively and this in turn creates investment and prosperity in the regions. This is all the more true today when we have such dreadful traffic congestion on our roads. Any substantial conurbation, I believe, will benefit enormously from having its own regional airport.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para30"></a>With that in mind, I should like to talk briefly about one such airport proposal, which is not very far from where I live. For that reason I declare an interest. I am referring to the proposal to turn RAF Finingley into a regional airport. As noble Lords may know, if it happens it is to become known as Doncaster Airport. Doncaster used to have its own light aviation airport with a grass runway not far from the racecourse. I used it in the past. But about seven years' ago it was closed and the land was developed, which, unfortunately, is something that is happening to too many light aircraft airfields, as has already been mentioned by my noble friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para31"></a>In view of the fact that Doncaster lost its airport, I am naturally in favour of the Finingley proposal. I believe that it will bring many benefits to the area, not least in jobs. However, support is not universal, as I understand it. I wonder whether the Minister can tell the House tonight whether there will be a planning enquiry before proceeding or whether it will be allowed to go ahead under local planning rules. I believe that currently there is some uncertainty, which is a bad thing, so perhaps the noble Lord can take this opportunity to clarify the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para32"></a>One of the very important aspects of this particular proposal is traffic planning, the provision of new roads and the upgrading of the existing ones. The A1 trunk road south of the Doncaster A1(M) section has a notoriously bad stretch between Ranby and Tuxford, some of which is considered so dangerous that a permanent 50 miles per hour speed limit has been imposed on it. It is also an area which is particularly vulnerable to traffic congestion at certain times of the day. I accept that this is slightly wide of the Unstarred Question, but I hope that the Minister will be able to say what plans there are for upgrading this stretch of the A1, which I should have thought was almost sine qua non in the provision of this airport.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para33"></a>My noble friend Lord Rotherwick made some interesting observations, one of which was that costs are pushing flying beyond the reach of our younger generation. As my noble friend Lord Goschen said, 65 per cent of our commercial pilots came up through the private pilot and hobby aviation route. I do not know what the Minister can say to allay that serious problem, but we ought to try to address it if we can.

<A NAME = "10227-25_para34"></a>I fear that regional airports are using pricing policies to deter general aviation. I hope that we can redress that in some way, because light aviation is a vital part of the fabric of our commercial infrastructure. I hope that general aviation will prosper.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para35"></a>I look forward to hearing the Minister's speech. I hope that he will confirm that the Government wish to promote general aviation in this country.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, has done us a service by introducing the debate. I have learned a lot from his detailed analysis of general aviation. Some time ago I lived in the United States for several years, where general aviation was a large industry. From what I have learned in the past few days in preparation for today's debate, it seems to be going the same way here as it did there.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para36"></a>Unlike the previous speakers, I am not a pilot--perhaps it is not necessary to make that point. Thinking of what the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, has just said, I am not sure whether, as a pilot, I would have had a greater or lesser feeling of security when I was skimming the mountainsides in the Andes in a commercial plane. That kind of flying is always frightening, however and whenever you do it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para37"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, gave us good evidence of the importance of general aviation to the air transport industry. It is not just private flying for rich men, but everything from pilot training through freight transfer to crop spraying and air-sea rescue.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para38"></a>The industry has a problem of reduced availability for general aviation. The Government concede in their consultation paper on the future of aviation that the problem can only get worse due to the pressure on airport space. At the same time, local authorities appear to the industry to be unsympathetic to general aviation. Some would say that they are ignorant of its contribution to the economy and over-sensitive to local people's complaints about aircraft noise and fears about increased activity at their local small aerodrome.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para39"></a>The noise from large commercial aircraft has been dealt with pretty successfully over the past 30 years or so via the system of air noise certification, which was forced on the civil servants, politicians and aircraft builders and operators by the strength of public opinion across many countries. I understand that quite a lot could be achieved by the introduction of mufflers or silencers to deal with the noise from smaller aircraft, which can be intensely annoying at a local level. What action could the CAA or the Government take to encourage the use of silencers now and to introduce a system of progressive noise reduction for smaller aircraft similar to that which operates for larger commercial aircraft? That is a different way of controlling aircraft noise from the designation of approach paths or the alignments of flight paths. Those matters seem to be the subject of the consultation paper on the control of noise around aerodromes, which takes no apparent interest in controlling the noise as it comes out of the aeroplane. Those are two different issues.
<P>


<a name="column_1213"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para40"></a>I do not accept the argument that local authorities ignore planning guidance. There may be an argument that the guidance could re-emphasise the economic value of general aviation, although I do not know enough about that guidance to say. In my experience, local authorities follow planning guidance, particularly when forming their local or strategic plan. They have to do so, or the Secretary of State will not approve the plan.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para41"></a>Furthermore, to pick up a point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, if any officer feels that a local elected authority is about to do something that will result in the proposal or plan being rejected at public inquiry, he will certainly tell the elected members so. Because of the extreme expense of going through an unsuccessful planning application procedure, most members will heed a suggestion that they should not do anything that would be likely to result in losing an inquiry.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para42"></a>Nor do I accept the point made in some of the briefing material that small aerodromes are worse placed to contest a planning proposal or put their case to a local planning inquiry than any other small business or individual. Many individuals appear successfully at local planning inquiries or similar occasions and put their views very well. Local planning inquiry judges are very good at ensuring that small organisations and individuals are heard and their points correctly recorded and given their due weight.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para43"></a>I agree that there is a need for a national aviation policy and an airports policy. The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, encouraged the Minister to take note of today's debate in the context of the current consultation process on the future of aviation. Is the Minister minded to construct an airports policy that could guide all those involved in providing airport capacity at any level? Such a policy is badly needed, if only to enable us to cut the time taken by airport development public inquiries. That huge use of time and other resources--I need only mention Terminal 5--is largely the result of having to argue the whole case for or against proposals for change of use or expansion or the creation of a new airport without the benefit of any common ground determined by the Government from which both parties can proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para44"></a>The last area in which there can be conflict is on safety, particularly near major airports. I agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, about LARS. It is important that whoever is in charge of air traffic control at the end of March--or whenever the new system comes into being--takes into account the importance of making sure that there is an effective method of air traffic control that governs the safety of general aviation, whether in or out of the controlled areas.

<A NAME="10227-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, like other noble Lords, I should like to congratulate my noble friend Lord Rotherwick on having introduced this short debate on general aviation. It is not an issue that is debated very often in this House, but in recent months, <P>


<a name="column_1214"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>funnily enough, it has featured occasionally, especially during the passage of the Transport Bill, which the Minister will no doubt remember well.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para45"></a>The term "general aviation" covers both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters operating for a wide variety of purposes including leisure pursuits, gliding, flying training and of course the business aviation sector, which includes air taxis and other means of transport. I was impressed to learn from my noble friend how many aircraft and activities were included in this category in this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para46"></a>The users and owners of these types of aircraft share concerns about reduced access to airport facilities and air space, LARS in particular, and the privatisation of National Air Traffic Services (NATS). Heathrow and other major airports for general aviation users are increasingly subject to restrictions. As capacity at peak times is put under more pressure, general aviation is likely to find it more difficult to access larger airports.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para47"></a>The industry is also concerned about the loss of smaller airports to redevelopment and the imposition of conditions of use at other airports that limit their ability to cater for the users' needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para48"></a>Planning Policy Guidance Note 13, which has been referred to by a number of speakers this evening, states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Airport development is promoted by developers through the usual planning process, though major schemes will usually be decided by the Secretary of State for the Environment (sometimes jointly with the Secretary of State for Transport) following a public inquiry."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-25_para49"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para50"></a>I presume that that note was written before the merger of the two departments, because the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Transport are now the same person. We are happy to see the Minister of Transport in the Chamber this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para51"></a>The members of the industry to whom I have spoken are keen that public inquiries should also take place where there is a proposal for the closure of these airports. General aviation, and business transport in particular, rely on access to these airports so that they can provide reliable services.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para52"></a>Much reference has already been made to the subject of planning, and there is no doubt that some local authorities have taken a very anti-general aviation stance during the preparation of local plans, primarily because of the noise that general aviation can cause.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para53"></a>General aviation airports tend to attract pilot training schools, hence there are a large number of small piston-engined aircraft flying repetitive circuit patterns, which can cause disturbance to the public. However, general aviation provides a very important supply of trained pilots for the airlines, as well as the smaller GA (air taxi and charter) operators.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para54"></a>The number of service pilots retiring and available on the civil market has reduced significantly over the last few years, emphasising the importance of civil pilot training. Similarly, new European licensing regulations are tending to increase the cost of training <P>


<a name="column_1215"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and have resulted in a reduction in GA training activity over the last year. It is very important to the wider industry that training should be allowed to continue.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para55"></a>The DETR circulated a consultation paper on the Control of Noise from Civil Aircraft last year, and the Airport Operators' Association highlighted the concern of smaller airports over proposals to provide local authorities with greater powers over airports and the need to consider the wide variety of size and type of airport throughout the UK. The Government's position is to prefer local noise issues at aerodromes to be addressed at the local level, but this must not be applied in a discriminatory manner that puts GA airports out of business.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para56"></a>I should like to refer briefly to the EU Draft Directive on the Assessment and Management of Environmental COM (2000) 468 final, which the Minister will no doubt have at his fingertips. The Government will need to ensure that this legislation does not conflict with DETR policy and that, once again, the resultant burden does not prove too great for the fragile financial state of many small airport businesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para57"></a>The point to be made here is that in order to encourage aircraft operators to fit quiet propellers and exhaust silencing systems, the industry needs as much assistance as possible from the regulatory authorities. There have been cases, for example, where the CAA has refused to accept the certification process carried out in another EU state, and has required full certification in the UK. The considerable extra cost of this process is in addition to the equipment cost and the cost of fitting it to the aircraft, and this acts as a significant deterrent to the aircraft owner or operator.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para58"></a>Regulation No. 3922/91 states in one of its articles that where a product has been approved in one or more JAA member states, it should be automatically accepted in another JAA member state, without the need for further additional certification or administration. That is the kind of small point that would make life for general aviation operators rather easier.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para59"></a>Recently, we have seen, as a result of the chaos on the railways, an increasingly large number of movements of air taxis and helicopters. As I understand it, the London Heliport at Battersea now caters for over 11,000 movements a year. Can the Minister therefore tell noble Lords what the Government are doing to improve and preserve the access of air taxis and helicopters to well-placed airports?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para60"></a>Another concern is the public/private partnership of NATS. We have been over this ground on several occasions, including earlier this afternoon. As we are all well aware, the Ministry is due to report back to the House within a short space of time on what has happened during the last three months. I think the Minister stated earlier that the subject of general aviation would be included within the overall context of the PPP. Can the Minister therefore say what meetings he or his colleagues have had with <P>


<a name="column_1216"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>representatives from the general aviation community during this period, and give an insight into the reassurances he has been able to give general aviation about the concerns that have been so well expressed by my noble friends on this issue this evening?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para61"></a>We are all well aware that in Europe there is a great move towards the creation of a single European sky, and according to reports that I have received, this is going full steam ahead. My final question, therefore, is this: can the Minster reassure noble Lords that during discussions about the single European sky the Government have taken on board the concerns of general aviation in that area?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para62"></a>I look forward to the Minister's reply.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, I should like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, for initiating the debate. I welcome the opportunity to share what the Government are doing to promote general aviation, and to address the hopes and concerns that have been expressed during the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para63"></a>The Government will do all that they can to promote every area of the UK aviation industry, from our major international carriers to our smaller enterprises. The UK aviation industry leads the way, thanks to the innovation and competitiveness of its aviation companies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para64"></a>Our aim, as Government, must be to create an environment that allows our aviation innovators to continue their excellent work and to foster growth in this area as far as possible. The contribution to this success made by the general aviation industry in all its guises is not to be underestimated. We will seek to continue to support general aviation and we will also ensure that the very specific needs of this industry are not overlooked. We will do that when we come to implement our general policy aims in the aviation and transport sectors.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para65"></a>However, in order to do so, we need to have in mind that the term "general aviation" covers a number of activities, including flying, training, leisure flying by private individuals and the use of air taxis. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, for his detailed description of the various aspects of the general aviation sector and for highlighting so clearly that each aspect has differing needs and priorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para66"></a>Although the activities covered under the heading of "general aviation" are extremely diverse, the combined contribution that general aviation makes is significant in economic terms and also in other ways, such as providing, as has been emphasised tonight, a source of pilots for the aviation sector as a whole. General aviation is also a source of pleasure for the pilots who use more than 8,000 general aviation aircraft in the UK and who are entitled to enjoy their right to fly. Of course, they must do so in a balanced way which takes into account the rights of those who live near aerodromes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para67"></a>Although I said that general aviation covers a wide range of activities, the Government will consider the needs of the general aviation industry as a whole and <P>


<a name="column_1217"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column 1217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will take those needs into account when shaping aviation policy. We shall not act without first seeking the views of those who are most likely to be affected by our actions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para68"></a>We have undertaken to introduce an air transport White Paper in order to prepare UK aviation policy 30 years ahead. It is essential that we get that right. We have issued a consultation document so that all the main parties can consider the issues and put forward their views. I look forward to receiving comments from the general aviation industry which should express the detail of the industry's needs and aspirations for the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para69"></a>I am aware that a good start has been made and that the general aviation voice was heard loud and clear at the recent seminar which we organised to discuss responses to the consultation document. I hope that the comments received from those working in general aviation will cover many of the issues raised today. Although this debate is perhaps not timely in that we currently await comments on the air transport consultation document, I shall try to specify why current policies are as they are and what they do to promote general aviation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para70"></a>I note from the title of today's debate, and from some of the interventions made, that planning is at the forefront of the minds of noble Lords and of our general aviation industry. Therefore, it may be helpful if I explain briefly the general rules and procedures which govern the planning system.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para71"></a>We have a "plan-led" planning system. The general principles are contained in Planning Policy Guidance Note 1--General Policy and Principles. That document explains that, where the adopted or approved development plan for the area contains relevant policies, planning applications must be determined in accordance with the local plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. On the other hand, applications which are not in accordance with relevant policies in the plan should not be allowed unless material considerations justify granting a planning permission.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para72"></a>Material considerations must be genuine planning considerations--that is, they must be related to the purpose of planning legislation, which is to regulate the development and use of land in the public interest. Obviously much will depend on the nature of the application under consideration, the relevant policies in the development plan and the surrounding circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para73"></a>The courts are the arbiters of what constitutes a material consideration. All the fundamental factors involved in land-use planning are included, such as the number, size, layout, design and external appearance of buildings and the proposed means of access, together with landscaping, the impact on the neighbourhood and the availability of infrastructure, and so on. Government statements of planning policy are material considerations which must be taken into account, where relevant, in decisions on planning applications.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para74"></a>Although development in general requires planning permission, some forms of development are granted a general permission by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 without the need to make a planning application to the local planning authority. That includes certain works related to aviation development. In the first instance, it is for the local planning authority to determine whether planning permission is required in any particular case.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para75"></a>Planning policy is of most interest to the general aviation sector in so far as it impacts on planning decisions in relation to aerodromes. In general, we have not intervened in the development of general aviation aerodromes. Essentially they are local planning matters which should be decided locally. However, through their local representatives, the Government scrutinise development plans and are able to keep a close watch on emerging policies which affect general aviation aerodromes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para76"></a>Generally, the Government will intervene only if planning issues of more than local importance are involved; for example, if a plan or application conflicts with national policies or important matters which may have significant effects beyond the immediate vicinity, or in cases which involve issues of national security. I note the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, about the outcome of planning decisions. Although I have no detailed comment to make on that this evening, the figures in the GAAC paper have been noted. We do not collect those figures centrally. Therefore, I am unable to verify the analysis of reasons for appeal and whether that warrants further consideration. However, planning authorities must make decisions on the basis of local facts.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para77"></a>In order to ensure a coherent approach to planning across different sectors and regions--I hope that this will help to provide some reassurance to the noble Viscount--25 planning policy guidance notes have been issued by the Government. All local authorities must take those into account in preparing the regional planning guidance and determining planning applications. They focus on the integration of land-use planning and transport, including the promotion of more sustainable transport choices both for people and for moving freight.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para78"></a>Transport guidance note PPG13 emphasises the important role that small airports and aerodromes can play for local business, recreational, training and emergency needs. For that reason, the guidance note advises that local authorities should take account of the important contribution that general aviation can make to local and regional economies, including the national need for pilot training. That guidance note is in the process of being updated. If the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, does not have a copy of the current issue, I shall certainly ensure that it is updated to take account of the changes that have been made in departmental structures. However, the document is being updated and it will continue to recognise the important contribution made by the general aviation sector to local economies and beyond.

<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para79"></a>A question was raised in relation to airport slots. I have already said that we shall do our utmost to promote and encourage the good work done by the general aviation industry. However, it must be done with a sense of perspective and with an eye for the realities of modern aviation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para80"></a>With regard to the issue of slots, since 1986 there have been legal constraints on the use of Heathrow and Gatwick Airports by business and general aviation during the hours of peak congestion. That is simply and obviously a consequence of the demands on capacity at those airports. I appreciate that over recent years the constraints have bitten increasingly hard as the airports have become more congested. However, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of the available infrastructure. A slot which is used for business aviation cannot be used for a scheduled service which reduces the passenger throughput. A mix of large and small aircraft also requires longer gaps between aircraft movements than where the fleet is more homogenous. That may have the added effect of reducing hourly capacity at airports where capacity is such a precious commodity.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para81"></a>Business and general aviation is not excluded from Heathrow or Gatwick and there are no plans that it should be. I accept the arguments made about the importance of business aviation, and I take on board the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool. I am afraid that I am unable to give much detail as to the current position with regard to the proposed Doncaster airport. Noble Lords will understand that I am constrained by the inhibition of the planning process because the possibility always exists that there may be a quasi judicial role for Ministers in the event of a call in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para82"></a>Thirty years ago in my business life I travelled many times on corporate aircraft between Heathrow, Manchester and Liverpool and I have done so many times since in England, across Scotland and abroad. I understand the importance of encouraging business travel to be flexible and efficient. That drives us towards economic competition and growth. Noble Lords need have no concerns on that score.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para83"></a>Business and general aviation still have a role to play in Heathrow and Gatwick. It is essential for the industry to recognise that there are no easy solutions and that the pressure on capacity will not go away, at least in the short and medium term. One response is to consider making greater use of alternative airports to serve the London area. Longer term, I refer back to our consultation document in pursuit of a White Paper. That process is supported by regional studies examining the best shape for the aviation industry in the next 30 years. That is an important process.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para84"></a>On the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, I confirm that while the CAA is currently reviewing the so-called large provision in the South East of England, it will certainly take into account some of the issues that the noble Baroness raised. That review is still in progress, but I am confident that any specific proposals concerning provision around Gatwick and Heathrow will be considered very carefully and acted on where necessary.

<A NAME = "10227-25_para85"></a>I say to the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, that I shall certainly take into account the views that noble Lords expressed tonight. Our debate has been an important contribution to the current consultations on air transport policy. The noble Viscount, like other noble Lords, made his point with great eloquence and force.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para86"></a>On the question of noise from civil aircraft, there has recently been a consultation on legislation for the control of noise from civil aircraft and the effect that that might have on general aviation. In launching the consultation process, we have not prejudged whether there should be any limit on the types or size of aerodromes that are liable to be designated. We are looking with interest at the views that we have received. It remains our preference where possible for aviation noise mitigation measures to be resolved between interested parties. The proposal to provide aerodromes with greater means of regulating flying behaviour will be an enabling power and it will be used only if there is a need to do more to ameliorate aircraft noise at a particular aerodrome.

<FONT SIZE=3>me to attempt an answer; even if I had made such an attempt, I should not have done so with any precision. I assure the noble Lord that in our consultations on the operational aspects of NATS with interested parties, we shall ensure that general aviation is consulted. The Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in another place have been conducting consultative meetings. I shall report back to the noble Lord in the very near future.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para88"></a>I hope that I have explained some of the ways in which the Government have acted to promote the general aviation industry. The best way in which we can do so is by providing a business environment that allows our companies to thrive. Our debate has shown that while that is the case, we need to examine several specific issues in relation to which the voice of the general aviation industry still needs to be heard. I urge the industry to use its voice.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-25_para89"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, for giving us the advantage of his extensive aviation experience and for securing this debate. If I have left any questions unanswered, I shall write to noble Lords with greater detail.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Kingsland </B>   moved Amendment No. 45:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 13, line 12, at beginning insert ("Save as provided in section 36,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-26_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-26_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 45, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 46. As the Committee will be aware, these amendments would permit the transfer or indeed the loss of a unit if something were or were not to happen. In reality, they are paving amendments for Clause 36 of the Bill. The intention is, quite simply, to allow the commonhold community statement to provide for a unit-holder to lose the unit if he fails to abide by certain conditions. In effect, it creates a parallel to the existing forfeiture provisions in leases.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-26_para2"></a>There is little in the Bill regarding dispute resolution within commonhold. Whatever is provided, there will almost certainly be a need for some form of ultimate sanction. As with all forms of contractual arrangement, if a party does not abide by its obligations under the contract, that party must expect, ultimately, to lose the benefit which the contract provides in return. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department   (Lord Bach): </B>  The noble Lord has spoken to two amendments. It seems to me to be logical to take the second of the amendments first. That would remove the word "not" from the subsection, thus making it possible for the commonhold community statement to make a provision for an interest in commonhold land to be lost or to transfer contingent on some future event. The thinking behind subsection (8) is the same as that behind paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 to the Bill, which specifies certain kinds of land that cannot become commonhold. In each case in paragraph 3 of Schedule 2, the estate in the land is subject to a statutory rule which allows or requires the estate to revert to a previous owner if some specified event occurs. Indeed, as I am sure the noble Lord will remember, this is entirely consistent with Clause 7(2)(b) of the draft Bill, on which the previous government consulted in 1996. We have followed the previous government's example.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-26_para3"></a>The commonhold association and the unit-holders in place in the development at any particular time should be in full command of the commonhold land. Plainly, the unit-holder's interest in his unit would be <P>


<a name="column_CWH1223"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1223</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>undermined-- weakened--by the risk that at some future time, contingent on something happening or not happening, over which he would almost certainly have no control, he was at risk of losing it. In the same way, the commonhold association being responsible for the common parts, it would be bad practice to set up a scheme that would potentially deprive it of any part of its assets at some future time. Any change to the extent of the commonhold should be the result of a decision taken by those in ownership and occupation at the time and not that of a decision taken some time previously, quite possibly by people who no longer have any connection with the development.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-26_para4"></a>The earlier amendment would make amended subsection (8) of Clause 30 subject to the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Save as provided in section 36".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-26_para5"></a>
However, we have looked in vain at Clause 36 for any provision which would serve to qualify the power to create contingent titles for which the amended clause would provide. Shortly, we shall come to an amendment to Clause 36, but that does not appear to be germane to this point. Therefore, I shall invite the noble Lord to withdraw that amendment when we come to it. Clause 36 has nothing to do with contingent interests; it is concerned simply with the enforcement of rights and responsibilities within a commonhold; for example, the payment of compensation to a unit-holder from the commonhold association for repairs that may take place in the unit-holder's premises on behalf of the commonhold association. Therefore, we do not believe that Clause 36 is relevant to this issue and we invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   The Minister has not addressed the central question that I posed. It is not clear to me why there should be no power akin to forfeiture in the system. The most effective sanction against a unit-holder failing to discharge his financial obligations to the association is to charge the unit as security for due performance. Unless the association has such security, its only ultimate remedy is to prove in the defaulting unit-holder's bankruptcy in which it may or may not recover a small dividend.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-26_para6"></a>One of the provisions which might properly be contained in the CCS, pursuant to Clause 36, is a prohibition on the creation of any new charge over the unit unless any debts due to the association shall first have been discharged, or are discharged simultaneously with the execution of the charge. I hope the Minister agrees that the absence of such a sanction is likely to make it very difficult to sell the commonhold scheme commercially.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   We do not agree, and we are not keen to bring into this field the notion of forfeiture. I am led to believe that it is one of the most hated leasehold powers. I should have said in my initial response that this resolution will be set out in the commonhold community statement. Perhaps the Committee will look at page 16 of the current draft which was distributed yesterday.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord, who is always generous in giving way when a member of the Opposition rises to speak. I understood that a draft was produced 10 days ago. Is there a new version?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   In my experience, the noble Lord is always unlucky as far as concern these matters. A new draft was sent to all noble Lords who took part in last week's Committee stage and spoke at Second Reading. We tried to make it available yesterday so that the Committee would have it today. I am sorry if it has not reached the Committee, but every effort was made to provide it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-26_para7"></a>The dispute resolution will be set out in the final commonhold community statement which is to be found at pages 15 and 16 of the current draft. As to forfeiture, my advice is that it will be possible for the commonhold association to proceed against a defaulting unit-holder, including by charging order and, eventually, possession. Forfeiture is not at present an option.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord for explaining the provenance of the most recent document to be circulated. The noble Lord draws my attention to pages 15 and 16 of the document. Will the noble Lord give the Committee an opportunity to consider proper amendments to those pages since they form the central plank of his response to my amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   We shall, of course, listen to any comments that are made about this and take them on board if we think that they are appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord. I take that remark to mean that we will have an opportunity to deal with these matters on the floor of the House. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   The noble Lord should be careful about agreeing to withdraw the amendment too easily. I did not say that there would necessarily be such an opportunity on the floor of the House. We will listen, of course, in the normal way--through correspondence, through any amendments that are brought forward or at meetings, which we are always glad to hold with any noble Lords who show an interest in these proceedings--but I was not saying that it would be at the Government's instigation that these matters would be debated on Report. I should like that to be absolutely clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   If I understand the Minister correctly, he will not be giving noble Lords the opportunity to consider, on the floor of your Lordships' House, in public, pages 15 and 16 of the draft CCS--even though he has conceded that they are his answer to the question as to why there are no provisions equivalent to forfeiture in the Bill.

<P>

<A NAME="10227-26_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   It is important for us to appreciate that, if there is any issue on which we feel that documents have arrived too late for us to consider it at this stage, we are of course free to bring it back on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-26_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   Of course. That is exactly what I am saying. The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, echoes exactly what I said. Of course you are absolutely at liberty to bring it back at Report stage. What I am saying is that the Government do not intend, at this stage, to produce any amendments to that effect. However, if amendments are put down in the proper way, as they will be, then we will of course have to answer them. I hope that there is no misunderstanding about this.

I did not intervene on the previous grouping because it seemed to concern both how documents such as the commonhold community statement were presented to the Committee and the specific point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para5"></a>Before I ask my question--I suspect that I am making the point for other noble Lords--perhaps I may say that we are genuinely grateful to the Government for circulating documents to us. However, it would be useful if those who were charged with circulating them realised that we are not all full time in this building. I received this morning the letter of 21st February with the drafts which were referred to at the previous day of Committee stage. The final <P>


<a name="column_CWH1226"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1226</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>paragraph of the letter said that a second edition of the draft would be available today. I opened the envelope when I was in another building and did not have an opportunity to obtain the other set of drafts. Although it is extremely helpful to have the documents, it would be a step forward if those who circulated them understood that noble Lords are not always in the building to receive them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para6"></a>My question on the commonhold community statement is based on the previous draft which to me looked very much like a lease and contained many of the provisions that I would expect to see in a residential lease. A good many of them are in square brackets and it is suggested that they should be optional. They relate to such matters as noise: no nuisance is to be created by playing musical instruments, and no pets are permitted without the consent of the commonhold association. Those are important issues. The over-loud playing of musical instruments, radios and so on can be very disturbing to neighbours, but the Government have told us that they hope that commonhold will be as close as possible to freehold. If one lived in a freehold house, possibly a terraced dwelling, close to neighbours who played the radio loudly one would be disturbed. I do not quite follow the Government's approach in the commonhold community statement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-27_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I have not had time to study my document. I am pleased to say that I had three copies and I was delighted to see that the last one shows the second draft, which means that I can put the first two aside. But they all came simultaneously. At least they are well labelled.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para7"></a>I am not clear about the noise. I recall the legislation on local authorities and the situation mentioned by the noble Baroness of two neighbouring houses. But there is recourse in law. Is she saying that there is or is not such recourse in commonhold? Normally one would expect to respect other people's peace and quiet within their own dwelling and it would be perfectly normal to have such a clause, whether in a lease or in a commonhold. I see no reason why it would not be there to protect others. It is usually enforced only if there is a quite outrageous case.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para8"></a>I can give an example. I left my unit for a time and the young man who took it decided that on Mardi Gras day he would put up a notice in the street saying that all were welcome to come to a party. Hundreds poured into his unit, and the other residents were very unhappy. I received a letter from the commonhold management--and rightly so. It is important, therefore, to have good conditions included. However, I have not yet been able to read them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-27_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Perhaps I may give a further explanation. The noble Baroness makes my case for me. I entirely agree that one should not disturb one's neighbours but the legislation to which she has referred seems to me to be the kind that one would expect to apply in a freehold situation. To have a clause creating a particular relationship within <P>


<a name="column_CWH1227"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1227</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commonhold such as one would see in a lease has led me to ask how closely the Government are trying to replicate leasehold rather than freehold.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   The interesting comments made by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hamwee and Lady Gardner, strengthen our view that it is appropriate that the commonhold community statement is not on the face of the Bill but is subject to regulation. It is a standard document but each commonhold, when it is set up, will have its own commonhold community statement. It is the distinction that there will be between them that will be critical for the living conditions that those in the commonhold have to agree.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para9"></a>I am very sorry that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, did not receive the draft statement in time and that other noble Lords have not had a chance to read it. We would welcome having the best address for any noble Lord for such correspondence so that we can get it to them as quickly as possible. But I hope that the Committee will give us credit for doing our very best to get these regulations out, as we promised at Second Reading. On many Bills in the not too distant past the Government have come under severe criticism--sometimes justified--for not having done what we have done on this occasion. While we take the criticism on the chin, we think that we have done rather well on this occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para10"></a>I return to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. The draft commonhold community statement is a template intended to provide the basic framework with room for flexibility for individual commonholds. It is getting that balance right between standardisation and covering the wide variety of circumstances that will occur.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para11"></a>The thinking behind the use of regulations to establish and control the CCS is much as it was for the establishment and control of the memorandum and articles. The document will contain a great deal of detailed information about such matters as hanging out washing, as well as more important matters to do with the rules relating to how default of duties will be dealt with, the setting and collection of commonhold assessments, and so on. Other items that will be dealt with in detail in individual commonholds will be, for example, putting out the rubbish for collection, or, as has already been pointed out, the keeping of pets.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para12"></a>The bulk of the document will be the plans and description of the development, much of which will be dictated by regulations issued by the Land Registry. We think that that kind of detail should be dealt with in regulations. It will allow us to keep up with the market, to amend the rules if they are found in some respects to be unworkable or if times change and circumstances require. We have provided the model documents as invited to by the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-27_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, I should like him to clarify two points. First, is what is contained in the commonhold community statement a template of best practice or a requirement? Secondly, in the draft that I have certain paragraphs <P>


<a name="column_CWH1228"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are in square brackets. Are those particularly significant? For example, are those the ones that are best practice and are the rest requirements? I am not clear whether there is any significance in the different typeface and the way that some paragraphs are put in square brackets.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-27_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   Like the noble Lord, we are feeling our way. We are trying week by week to give a fresh draft of this important statement so that when it comes to putting a final draft to the House, which we will have to do in due course if the Bill becomes law, we have it right. I hope the noble Lord will indulge me by not insisting on an answer to his very direct questions. We are trying to get it right; it is supposed to be a template; they are supposed to be the kind of regulations that will assist, some of which will be standard and others will be open to flexibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-27_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   On the first day of Committee, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said that there were areas on the statement out of which one could not contract. I think that followed up my point that we wanted as simple and standard a document as possible. Perhaps I may suggest to the Minister that for the third draft that he presents to us the items that cannot be changed between the parties, the ones that are absolutely standard for every unit, should be in one typeface, and items that can be changed between the parties and additions should be in another typeface.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-27_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   I thank the noble Earl for that suggestion, which we will certainly take on board. I am very grateful to him.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-27_para16"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 47, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 48. The Minister's response to my noble friend Lord Caithness in the dying moments of the last series of interchanges has helped me to shorten my own contribution to the debate on these amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para18"></a>From what the Minister said, I take it that he is prepared to reconsider the balance between what is in the schedule to the Bill and what might be dealt with by regulations in the content of the memorandum of association and the commonhold community statement. I profoundly agree with my noble friend Lord Caithness that it is very important to have some clear standard provisions on the face of the Bill--even if they are only in a schedule-- rather than to leave them to regulations which can be changed from month to month or from year to year by a procedure which does not allow your Lordships' House to table amendments to any document proffered by the government of the day.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para19"></a>Behind the amendments that I have tabled to Clause 33 and Schedule 3 lies a wider concern. It is whether the Government are using too powerful an <P>


<a name="column_CWH1229"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1229</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>instrument--that is to say, the memorandum and articles of association under the Companies Acts--to deal with a series of problems that may more simply be dealt with by a tailor-made form of association and set of rules.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para20"></a>Some commonhold associations will cover a very small number of unit-holders, where the management problems they face are relatively straightforward. Is it right that they should be faced with the full panoply of the Companies Acts as a framework within which to pursue their management responsibilities? I would go further than that. If the Government insist on using the Companies Acts as the basic framework for the management of a commonhold association, would it not be better to adopt the model of a company limited by shares rather than a company limited by guarantee?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para21"></a>I can see in that situation at least two advantages that would accrue to the commonhold association. First, the association would be able to differentiate between unit-holders who had different degrees of interest in the association, perhaps by having some shares as category A shares and other shares as category B shares.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para22"></a>Secondly, it would provide a simple solution to the problem that I raised when we discussed the first set of amendments; that is, the problem of requiring individual unit-holders to meet their obligations with respect to the common property. A simple provision which prevented the transfer of a share from vendor to purchaser until the vendor had met all his obligations could achieve the same result as a forfeiture provision, or a provision similar to forfeiture of the kind I sought to describe in my earlier amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-27_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Before I speak to Amendments Nos. 78 and 79, which have been included in this group, I shall touch briefly on what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said about the corporate structure. I know this will come up in subsequent amendments but as the noble Lord has raised it now, it might be convenient to deal with it briefly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para23"></a>I strongly disagree with him about the suitability of company limited by shares, since the whole nature of a commonhold association is that it should be on a one member, one vote basis. There should not be votes weighted by shares or share capital; nor should there be different kinds of shares. However, I wonder whether the Government have considered the possibility of allowing CHAs to be set up--as an alternative to a company limited by guarantee--as a limited liability partnership, under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act passed in the previous Session. It was set up as a "cheap and cheerful" form of incorporation, suitable for small businesses and with very considerable simplification as compared with the ordinary company. This might be suitable for small CHAs, where only four or five people are involved, all of whom wish to take part in the running of the organisation. I would like to think about the matter further and possibly to bring it back at Report stage.
<P>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1230</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para24"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 78 and 79. The former deals with the fact that under Clause 31(1), regulations make provision for the content of commonhold community statements and many "permit, require or prohibit" the inclusion of certain provisions. Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 3, the regulations require to make provision about the form and contents of the memorandum and articles of the company.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para25"></a>The memorandum and articles of the CHA and the commonhold community statement are obviously of central importance to the future of commonhold. I welcome the production of drafts but these are still at a very early stage. They will need a good deal of further consultation and working out. The House will need an opportunity to give them a proper debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para26"></a>I accept, and again disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that it is more appropriate to have these matters in regulations than on the face of the Bill. The memorandum and articles and the community statements will require modification from time to time. Indeed, since the Companies Act 1985, even the standard table A (they are now tables A to G) of the various types of company is contained in regulations, rather than being set out in a schedule to the Companies Act. That seems a perfectly suitable precedent for the memorandum and articles of a company of this kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para27"></a>However, I have some concern about the memorandum in particular. This seems too long, compared with normal memoranda, and too broad. For example, taking together paragraphs 3.21, 3.22, 3.40 and 3.41, a commonhold association could set up in business as the developers of a beach resort in the Canary Islands or of an office building in Hong Kong, without doing anything contrary to the memorandum.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para28"></a>The community statement also needs vetting. For instance, Article 58, which is obligatory, states that except with the consent of the directors of the CHA, no unit-holder can have in the unit any,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"mechanical, scientific or electrical apparatus other than ordinary domestic electrical appliances".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-27_para29"></a>
Thus, permission would be necessary for, for example, a disabled person to keep an electric powered wheelchair in his flat, that clearly not being an ordinary domestic electrical appliance. It would also cover any apparatus that was mechanical but not electrical; for instance, a hand-powered coffee grinder. At least in the second draft the ban on having pets without the consent of the association has been downgraded from a compulsory to an optional provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para30"></a>In the draft, of course, some provisions are obligatory and some are optional. I am concerned--in this I follow what was said in the previous debate by my noble friend Lady Hamwee, the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, and the noble Earl, Lord Caithness--about the status of these optional provisions. Can they be modified? For example, would it be possible to include a requirement that cats could be kept without the consent of the commonhold association but that consent would be required to keep dogs on the grounds that they are noisier and messier? <P>


<a name="column_CWH1231"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Can the CHA decide that the community statement should include other provisions--in addition to those that are set out in the drafts--provided that they are not inconsistent with the obligatory rules? That is a very important point. There is no indication on the face of the Bill and we do not know what the regulations will say about that. Is everything prohibited from inclusion in the community statement which is not either required or expressly permitted by the rules?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-27_para31"></a>We need a proper discussion of these matters. I strongly suggest that, although we have had a chance to see them, because of the early state of both the memorandum and articles and the community statement, it would be appropriate for the first set of them to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in order that we may, in due course, discuss them properly.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My main experience is as a unit-holder and, therefore, I cannot say that I have ever been much involved in the direct management of the company. However, I phoned Australia a week or so ago to ask about that and to ask, in particular, whether the full obligations of company law came with being the owner of the unit. I was told, no; it came within a slightly different company law. It came under a specific category but you filed your returns and annual accounts in the usual way. I wonder, therefore, whether the Minister could find out more from New South Wales about exactly how this ties in with normal commercial law or company law.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para0"></a>I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, on what is a normal appliance. There is nothing more normal, in these days when we are so aware of disability, for someone to want to have an electric wheelchair. If I were a unit-holder, I would certainly defend until the last my right to my electric wheelchair. The noble Lord's coffee grinder and electric wheelchair were not particularly good examples. However, I take his point about cats and dogs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para1"></a>My own experience is that you can agree anything provided that you attend the management meeting and that those present at the management meeting all choose to accept whatever is proposed. Those who do not attend meetings find that matters go ahead in a way that they do not particularly like. Therefore, the message is that you have to take an active part in your commonhold, to be there and help to make the decisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   The Minister was most kind in his response to my earlier inquiry. We all agree that commonhold is an idea whose time has come, but there are some of us who fear that commonhold will never happen because leasehold will continue to run on. That has been discussed already.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para2"></a>However, one of the things that will make commonhold happen is for there to be as simple a set of documents as possible. At the moment, there are 47 pages in the commonhold community statement and the memorandum of association and it is an inexorable trend that these documents will become <P>


<a name="column_CWH1232"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1232</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>longer as we go on. I hope that the Minister will prevent civil servants from running away with the ball on this. This could become 70, 80 or 90 pages--I remind the Minister of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill. If it becomes complicated and difficult, far fewer people will seek to use it, because it will just be so complicated to understand.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para3"></a>I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, about the way that the objects in the memorandum have been set out. I find it extraordinary that, in paragraph 3.31, it should be permissible to lend money or to give credit. I am not quite sure why a commonhold would be lending money and I am not sure that that does not take it into another set of regulations in any case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-28_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   With regard to the memorandum of association, is the use only of object clauses and no powers at all intentional? Is that particular to this form of company?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   I should declare an interest in that I have enfranchised, as I explained at Second Reading. I then ended up having created a right to enfranchise and a right to manage a company. With the best legal brains in the country, we created our memorandum and articles of association, which are only a few pages long. We had an extraordinarily difficult time, because people who had never been directors of a company were asked to be directors of a company. At an extraordinary annual general meeting, with the right notice being served, we persuaded every tenant to agree to be a director. Then one of them asked, "What happens if someone falls off a ladder? Am I liable?" And then all the anxiety and fears arose, and we had to take out all the extra insurances.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para4"></a>We then found that we had sought permission to file relatively limited accounts. That was fairly complicated but, in the end, we got it down to one page and, 18 months later, we filed the accounts. The whole activity relates entirely to neighbourliness, if that is the word. If you know each other, there is no problem. You explain all the difficulties, such as the problem you may have about the parrot, or the noise on the floors above. However, it is when you are different from each other that the problems arise. I would hesitate to make the point, but the longer documentation is, the more likely it is to make people nervous.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para5"></a>I hope we can make it shorter. Should the Minister feel willing to consider what we managed to do, I shall willingly send him a copy. I feel that the corporate entity of a limited liability company is just as good as that which is proposed at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   Like the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, perhaps I may make a contribution to the debate based on some experience. I live in a small house in Pimlico. It is held on leasehold and is divided between four tenants. We have had some difficulties in this property. The superior leaseholder had the right to appoint a managing agent who would set up a management company whose expenses we would subscribe to. The <P>


<a name="column_CWH1233"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>management agent he appointed, although a well-known firm, failed to submit the company's return and so it was struck of the companies' register, whereupon the tenants in this house got together and told the landlord that he had appointed a rotten agent. We said we would get the company put back on the register and run it ourselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para6"></a>We have done that and it works very satisfactorily--it is very economic--but I am sure that we will approach this legislation in the hope that it will be possible to turn the procedures in the Bill to a vehicle to having the right to acquire the freehold, with the management company playing a part in that. I hope that the machinery in the Bill will be sufficiently flexible to allow all these various different circumstances--we all have slightly different experiences--to be taken into account in a flexible piece of legislation. As I work my way through the legislation, I find it rather difficult to see that that is what would happen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   We have had an extremely useful and interesting discussion on this set of amendments. I am very grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken, particularly those who have done so from their own experiences. One of the great advantages of the Committee stage in this House is that we can gather from people's experiences and what they tell us when we are preparing the documents that will eventually be put before the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para7"></a>Perhaps I may ask the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, about Amendment No. 78. I do not think that he spoke to it. He spoke to Amendment No. 79, with which I shall deal--I hope to his pleasure--in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   That was a paving amendment to cover subsections (4) and (5) of Amendment No. 79. It removes Clause 61(2)(e) which makes all regulations under this part subject to the negative resolution procedure. Amendment No. 79 includes a provision in subsection (4), so the first regulations under Clause 31 and paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 have to have the affirmative resolution procedure and then other regulations have the negative procedure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   I am sorry if I misunderstood the noble Lord. We have taken Amendments Nos. 78 and 79, not just to deal with Clause 31 and Schedule 2(3), but also Clause 3(1)(e), Clause 3(2)(f), and Clause 19(4). I want to make sure that I answer his points correctly. The noble Lord has not dealt with the three earlier points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-28_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I believe that my recollection is at fault. I thought that we had covered most of that last time. Briefly, I felt that Clause 3(1)(e)--the power to prescribe classes of person whose consent is required--and Clause (3)(2)(f), which enables the court to dispense with the requirement to consent in specified circumstances, were important powers which ought to be exercised only by the affirmative resolution procedure.

<A NAME = "10227-28_para8"></a>The most important, however, was Clause 19(4) which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Regulations may modify a rule of law about leasehold estates (whether deriving from the common law or from an enactment) in its application to a term of years in a commonhold unit".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-28_para9"></a>
That is an extensive Henry VIII power and, in particular, is one which ought have the affirmative resolution procedure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-28_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. The amendments in this group have in common the aim of requiring provision which is to be made by regulations either to be put on the face of the Bill or to be made by way of affirmative rather than negative resolution procedure. Subject to what I say about Amendment No. 79, with a view that all matters covered are appropriate for regulations made by negative resolution procedure, the first three amendments in this group, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, would effectively require the model memorandum and articles of commonhold association to be fixed on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para10"></a>We believe we have reached a stage of development of the draft model memorandum and articles which makes its likely contents clear, although we are far from having reached any final decisions about the document that we put before the House, and that fixing it on the face of the Bill would, on balance, forsake flexibility and the ability to consult further for minimal gain and certainty.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para11"></a>During discussion on the previous group, I said to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, that it was not that we would put these matters on the face of the Bill, but that when we drafted our next draft, as it were, we would distinguish between what we saw as something that was definite on all, and those on which there could be options. I think that was clear to him when I said it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para12"></a>We believe that we have it right in regulations and those first three amendments should not be pressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para13"></a>Before I move to the fourth and fifth amendments, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked why not a tailor-made association or set of rules. We remember that the 1996 Bill to create a free-standing vehicle produced great complexity on the face of that Bill, which came in for considerable--and perhaps justified--criticism and did not produce the simplicity for which we are all searching.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para14"></a>The noble Lord mentioned interest in the idea of making this a company guaranteed by shares. We agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, about the essential nature of commonhold being one member one vote. As to his cheap and cheerful suggestion about the Limited Liability Partnerships Act, we will consider that, and no doubt he will consider it further. Our inclination is to say that it is perhaps new and untried and that a company limited by guarantee is a fairly simple and well understood structure. I suspect that we would need some persuading before we changed from such a company limited by guarantee.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para15"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 78 and 79. These amendments would subject certain sets of regulations to the affirmative resolution procedure. Subsection (3) <P>


<a name="column_CWH1235"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1235</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of Amendment No. 79 would cover regulations made under Clause 3(1)(e), Clause 3(2)(f) and Clause 19(4). We believe that on balance these are matters of detail of the kind to which regulations are well suited. There is nothing here of significant policy impact. They are all powers to enable flexible and targeted provision--where, for example, the shoe pinches--to ease potential blockages or difficulties. For example, while the power in respect of consents may appear wide-ranging, it is intended as a safety net to protect the interests of people in certain circumstances in which the change to commonhold might damage their interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para16"></a>As to Clause 19(4), which was described as a Henry VIII power, we do not think that it is as drastic as it looks. It is directed only to rules of landlord and tenant law which may be found to cut across or be inimical to the rules governing leasing within commonholds. Some, if not all, of those rules have already been addressed in consequential amendments, although we cannot be sure that we have caught them all. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that that clause was brought to the attention of the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee by my officials--that committee not having spotted that clause--and we were told that the committee was satisfied. I recall his sad account of events last week on that matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para17"></a>I turn to subsection (4) of the amendment, which would affect the first set of regulations under Clause 31 which governs the CCS, and Schedule 2(3) which governs the content of the memorandum and articles of commonhold association. We accept that much more work needs to be done on those. That is one of the points of bringing out drafts at proper intervals. When we have reached a conclusion on them, both documents will go out to wide consultation outside the House before they are introduced in the House. I was asked about optional and mandatory. We take the point. We want to have a closer look and to be able to say which we see as which when we come to those final documents.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-28_para18"></a>The report from the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee referred to Clause 31 and Schedule 2(3) and stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The House may wish to see a draft or at least the principal elements of the regulations before reaching a decision about the merits of the provisions. Failing that, the House may think it appropriate that the first set of regulations in each case should require affirmative procedure".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-28_para19"></a>
We recognise entirely why that very respected committee reported as it did. We have circulated models of the documents--first and second drafts--and those revised drafts will be subject to further refinement, particularly in the light of this debate and other debates that we hold in Committee and elsewhere, and subject to wider consultation. Nevertheless, they are substantial drafts which we believe amply fulfil the requirements of the committee. So we could be excused from going to the second part of the committee's recommendation, which was that if we did not provide drafts we should agree to affirmative resolution. I am happy to tell the Committee that we have taken the view--and I hope <P>


<a name="column_CWH1236"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1236</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the Committee will agree--that they are such important documents that, in principle at least, there is a good deal to be said for the suggestion that they should come back to the House and be subject to the affirmative rather than negative procedure. That is how our mind is working at present. We recognise the concerns underlying the new subsections in Amendment No. 79. I invite the Committee to allow us to consider in good time for the Report stage whether that approach is appropriate.

<A NAME="10227-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that response. It is a concession that I hope will be made. While I recognise that the Government have done their best to produce drafts and have now produced two versions of the documents, there may well be substantial changes before they become a draft order. There will be a good deal of consultation and it is right that they should come back for affirmative resolution. Unfortunately, it is not possible later to amend them at that stage, but it will be possible to have a proper debate in your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I thank the Minister very much indeed for his extremely full response not only to my amendment but also to those tabled by others. The contributions from all sides of the Committee have helped to focus on the underlying issues that the amendments sought to reveal.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para0"></a>I draw some comfort from what the Minister said in response to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, about the affirmative procedure for the regulations. However, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has rightly pointed out that even with an affirmative resolution, your Lordships' House is unable to amend the underlying document. I regard that as a serious defect. I therefore put the Minister on notice that on Report I shall seek to make both the commonhold association agreement and the commonhold community statement schedules to the Bill so that at Third Reading they can be amended.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para1"></a>I accept that it may be appropriate to retain the use of regulatory procedures for some elements in those documents, but I am convinced that the balance at the moment between what is in Schedule 3 and what is, for example, in the commonhold association agreement is wrong. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 50, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 52. Both amendments affect Clause 34, which is a critically important clause. It creates on the part of directors of community associations a specific duty to manage. In subsection (1) the primary objective of the directors is to give full effect to the rights and enjoyment of property of each unit-holder. These two amendments seek to improve subsection (3) which creates special considerations for the directors where there has been a failure by a particular unit-holder. The message of this Bill often includes the tedious but occasionally contains some linguistic charm. Last week we debated the concept of the flying commonhold. If one looks at Clause 34(3)(a) one finds the concept of inaction for the sake of harmony, which would surely be a suitable epitaph for the prime ministership of Stanley Baldwin. But considerable care should be exercised when one converts it into a legislative concept, and this amendment seeks to introduce such care.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para10"></a>Why? Let us take the example of 10 unit-holders, eight or nine of whom pay their dues regularly one or two of whom are recalcitrant. As the clause presently stands, the directors, who numerically may not represent the entire force of eight or nine unit-holders who pay, may decide that it is better for all of them to give up on the one or two recalcitrant unit-holders and let them get away with it. That puts a premium on intransigence by such defaulting unit-holders. The amendment introduces into subsection (3)(a) the concept that directors cannot choose not to act where the result would be financial difficulty for the majority who pay. The proposition is a simple one and I hope that it commends itself to the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para11"></a>The second amendment deals with subsection (3)(b) which advises directors to have regard to the desirability of arbitration and other means of settlement, which is an entirely sensible approach. By the insertion of "particular" before "regard" I seek to introduce some emphasis. The Minister may well say that it adds nothing, and I may well agree. I choose the word because it is sufficiently puny to stimulate the parliamentary draftsman into a greater degree of emphasis, whereby directors choose legal representation as a last rather than first resort.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para12"></a>I hope that some form of wording can be introduced to make directors, as consistently as possible around the country, look to non-legal solutions before they approach lawyers. This is especially important if directors put the management of the units into the hands of management companies which may have a financial incentive with friendly lawyers to go to court at the first opportunity. Those are the purposes of the two amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, raises one of the more difficult issues; namely, non-payment of service charges and the consequential impact upon the maintenance of the building or upon others. It is unfortunate that as the law stands people who live abroad, or who may be on holiday, always find plenty of excuses as to why certain things have or have not happened. The matter goes far beyond "the cheque is <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>in the post". People transfer their properties and obtain permissions of landlords or companies without having paid their service charges. The problem is that that burden often falls on others, some of whom have retired, who have made careful budgets for the amount that they must pay. There needs to be some protection within the Bill. I am not sure that the amendments tabled by the noble Lord are correct. I had thought that perhaps penalties should be imposed with the right to charge interest at the exorbitant rate charged by many credit card companies. It is a difficult issue and, as the Bill is about money, where money is not paid when it is due the issue should be properly addressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-29_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Like the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, I found the introduction of the maintaining of harmonious relationships an interesting one to be brought in by legislation. It makes me wonder how this provision lies with the director's normal fiduciary responsibility. Does this provision mean that that normal responsibility is somehow downgraded? I do not know the answer to that and should be grateful if the noble Lord could tell us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   The point raised by my noble friend introduces the subject matter of Amendment No. 51, which is in the next group but should probably have been grouped with the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan. I am quite happy to take that separately or to take it now, whichever would be preferable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   I can be brief in what I have to say. Those who heard the Second Reading speech of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, and his praise of the language of the Bill, in particular the phrase "maintaining harmonious relationships", will not easily forget the comments he made. No one has yet sought to delete that phrase from the Bill and I trust and hope that no one will.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para13"></a>As regards my noble friend's two amendments, we are interested in both of them; perhaps more the first than the second. With the permission of Members of the Committee and of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, I should like to take them away and consider them. If we feel that there is something in them, we will table amendments with which he will not be dissatisfied, perhaps more likely in respect of Amendment No. 50 than Amendment No. 52.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para14"></a>In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I do not know the answer. Rather than guess, perhaps I may write to her after due reflection as to whether it affects the position on the duty of directors under the Companies Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-29_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   The Minister has been helpful in his reply. In closing on the issue of duty to manage, I suggest that in all the various clauses with which we will deal, the one question that unit-holders when they meet will ask is, "What are we here for?". The clause requires that directors shall manage in the best interests of the unit-holders.

<A NAME = "10227-29_para15"></a>I noticed at a glance, though I have not studied it carefully, that the memorandum of association makes no reference to the duty to manage. That seems unfortunate. Neither does the community statement explain to people who may not be trained lawyers how they should implement Clause 34. I do not wish to extend this document. As the noble Lord, Lord Monson, rightly said, it should be reduced to its simplest form. Those around the Minister in his department could probably do it on two sheets of paper. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-29_para17"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move Amendment No. 51. Perhaps I may take advantage of the relative informality of these proceedings. We had mentioned in the previous debate and indeed in earlier ones of how to take proceedings against somebody who fails to pay up and how to enforce them. Would I be right in thinking that, while there is no provision here for forfeiture, there is nothing to prevent a commonhold association, which is owed money by a unit- holder, seeking a charging order under the Charging Orders Act, if necessary using powers under that Act to sell the unit and recover the amount owing which had been unpaid?
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para19"></a>I shall now move on to the proper subject of Amendment No. 51. Clause 34(3) appears, at any rate by implication, to allow directors to avoid action only if inaction will establish or maintain harmonious relationships; that is, they say they need not take action in specific circumstances and do not mention any other circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para20"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bach, said that he hoped that no one would remove the reference to the maintenance of harmonious relationships. That is exactly what the amendment does. It is of course desirable to maintain harmonious relationships but, first of all, there may be cases where action needs to be taken at risk of damage to relationships. Plainly, the maintenance of relationships is not the only possible justification for inaction.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para21"></a>I give one example. Let us say that one unit-holder, in the view of the directors, is not complying with his obligations. The directors are advised that their view is probably correct, but not certain. The particular unit- holder is known to be extremely litigious, as some of them are, and is likely to challenge any enforcement action; and, if he is successful, the CHA will incur substantial costs. It would be reasonable, therefore, for directors not to take action if the breach of obligation is not likely to have serious consequences for the other members. That is an example of the kind of case that the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, had in mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-29_para22"></a>It is a well established principle of company law that directors must act, or refrain from action, in the interests of the company. Why not simply apply the <P>


<a name="column_CWH1240"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>same principles here and say that the directors must act in the interests of the commonhold association as a whole, it being of course a matter for their judgment as to what the interests of the commonhold association are in the particular circumstances with which they are faced?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-30_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I rise to support the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, because the amendment makes the Bill clearer and the running of an association clearer. Perhaps I may ask the Minister--a well-known lawyer--what his opinion would be if there were a conflict of interest for the directors between establishing and maintaining harmonious relationships between the unit-holders and the interests of the community association. There could well be situations where that arises.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-30_para0"></a>We go back to the point of law mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. It is the primary duty of the directors of the commonhold association to look after that association.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Clause 34 imposes on the commonhold association a duty to manage. Subsection (3) allows the directors of the association to decide not to act against the failure by a unit-holder to do something if they think it would maintain harmonious relationships between unit- holders.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-30_para1"></a>These amendments--I refer to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, in the previous group as well as to all the amendments in this group--provide variations on that theme. The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would permit no action if it would be in the best interests of the commonhold association. My Amendment No. 54 has a similar effect. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, would allow inaction only where there would be no financial disadvantage to the others as a result. My Amendment No. 53 would disqualify a director from taking part in the decision if he or she were a defaulter.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-30_para2"></a>I have now to choose between my two amendments. I believe that Amendment No. 54 is preferable to the other. Its effect is broader than that of Amendment No. 51, in that it requires the directors to exercise their whole duty to manage in the best interests of the association, rather than just give them discretion not to act. It continues to allow the directors not to act against every trivial infringement if that would maintain harmony in the community. The requirement to exercise discretion in the best interests of the community offers protection against directors not enforcing against their friends when it would be to the benefit of the whole community if they did act.

<A NAME="10227-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am sorry that the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, is not to receive a response to the amendment from a well known lawyer. The response comes from a less well known market researcher, but that is all that he is entitled to. I deal <P>


<a name="column_CWH1241"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1241</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>first with the point about charging orders. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is correct that that is available to any commonhold association which seeks to enforce arrears against a recalcitrant unit-holder.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-30_para3"></a>I turn to the amendments in this group. Amendment No. 51 removes the felicitous phrase "harmonious relationships". I would also be sad to see that go. The amendment would tend to blur the distinction between the commonhold association and its members in their capacity as unit-holders. As it stands the subsection is intended to allow the commonhold association to choose not to take formal action against a unit-holder if it seems best not to do so, without forfeiting its right to take action later against the same unit-holder, or any other unit-holder, for that or some other infraction.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-30_para4"></a>We expect there to be two broad types of complaint within commonholds, in the same way as there are now in leasehold blocks or other circumstances in which people live together cheek by jowl. One will be the more formal type in which the association itself considers taking steps to deal with some failure, or compel some action by a unit-holder. The other will be a complaint about one unit-holder that is brought to the notice of the association by another with more or less justification. The association by its directors is already bound to permit or facilitate the exercise by unit-holders of their right to, and enjoyment of, their freehold estate in their units by virtue of Clause 34(1). By virtue of Clause 34(2) it is directed to use the powers created by Clause 36 to deal with infractions or failures by unit-holders.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-30_para5"></a>Clause 34(3) is designed to be a safety valve. If the directors of the association, acting with the best interests of the association in mind--as they are bound to do by virtue of their office--genuinely believe that inaction in the face of a complaint is more likely than not to establish or maintain good relations between the unit-holders, that permits them to exercise some discretion. They may legitimately refuse to take formal action against a unit-holder who hangs out the washing on a Sunday afternoon in contravention of the CCS, thinking instead that a quiet informal word with the unit-holder, perhaps when meeting in the lift or over coffee, would be more conducive to good relations than the legalistic step of issuing the notice that they would be entitled to serve. Therefore, nothing is taken away but something is added. In answer to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, that does sit with the directors' normal fiduciary duties; it will operate side by side. It will not be possible to decline to take action where inaction will damage the company or unfairly prejudice its members, or any class of them. Amendment No. 51, therefore, misses the point that there is an opportunity on the face of the Bill for directors of the association, who must always have the best interests of the association in mind, to use some discretion in order to help promote good relations between the unit-holders; in other words, to exercise people rather than business skills. After all, without good relations and goodwill no amount of efficient running of the association and serving of notices will make the commonhold a good place in which to live, <P>


<a name="column_CWH1242"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1242</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and that is what Part I of the Bill is about. With some reluctance, we believe that we are better off with the Bill as it stands.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-30_para6"></a>I turn to the three remaining amendments in this group. I shall pass over Amendment No. 53 which is not the preferred amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-30_para7"></a>In the case of Amendment No. 54, the duty of directors comes under the Companies Act. A director's duty is always to act in the best interests of the company. There is nothing to be gained and there is potential for confusion if that duty appears expressed differently in a multiplicity of places in the statute book. Our decision to opt for a Companies Act vehicle for the commonhold association was not capricious. It was taken in the knowledge that we import with it many useful concepts which fit well with our policy intentions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-30_para8"></a>Amendment No. 75 imposes explicitly on the directors of the commonhold association a duty which is implicit but perfectly clear from Clause 32 read together with Clauses 11 and 24. The purchase of a part of a commonhold by a compulsory purchaser will give rise to a change in the physical confirmation of the commonhold. Clause 11 provides a definition of a commonhold unit by reference, inter alia, to plans. Clause 24 defines the common parts as all that land within the commonhold which is not for the time being a unit. In both cases, the definition is made by means of the CCS. It follows that a change brought about by compulsory purchase, or indeed any other sale or purchase, must be recorded in the CCS.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   The Minister said that the duties under the Companies Act must be implied into the Bill. However, I wonder how he feels about circumstances in which the duty under the Companies Act would conflict with the contents of Clause 24(3)(a).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I said in respect of Amendment No. 51 that if there were to be a conflict, or if an action would result in damage to the company, the directors would have to intervene. This gives them an additional discretion only to do or not do something without going through the full formality. Nothing takes away either from their rights as directors or from their duties as directors under the Companies Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   As a former market researcher, perhaps I may help a little. We are talking here about the definition of the phrase "duties of care". There is a mixture of duties of care as a director, but there is a duty of care to everybody as a unit-holder and to take into account their personal circumstances which may vary from one to the other. Perhaps if the phrase "duties of care" could be used, it would be easier for some of us to understand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I, too, am a former market researcher. Clearly, I would not be standing here if I still were. My answer would be that the Companies Act applies. I do not have the full volume of the Companies Act in front of me, nor indeed the <P>


<a name="column_CWH1243"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>single volume from the review committee. If "duty of care" was used there, it applies here. If it was not, it does not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister but I am not entirely convinced by his argument. It seems to me that the maintenance of harmonious relationships may very well be in the interests of the commonhold association as a body; frequently it will be. If so, there is no need for a specific reference. If it is not in the interests of the commonhold association, it would be wrong to refuse to take action simply to maintain harmonious relationships.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-30_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The failsafe is the other way. They can always take action in the interests, and indeed they are obliged to take action in the interests of the commonhold association. If there is any question of damage to the interests of commonhold associations, they are obliged to take action. This is a let out where there is no issue of damage.

<A NAME="10227-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   If the Government take that view, and if they are not prepared to accept my amendment, it would be desirable to accept the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in order to put that point on the face of the Bill and leave no room for doubt in the minds of the court or, more importantly, in the minds of directors or their advisers who may be required to read the Bill and decide what it means.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-31_para0"></a>I should also point out that the maintenance of harmonious relationships may not only be between unit-holders but between occupiers who are not unit-holders.

<A NAME = "10227-31_para6"></a>
The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 55 seeks to remove the requirement for the regulations to make provision for a tenant of a let unit to enforce a duty against another tenant, unit-holder or the association. Amendment No. 56 seeks to enable a tenant to pay any moneys owing on the unit to the association if his landlord, the unit owner, were in default, and then to offset that sum against the money that he owed to the landlord in order to avoid any risk of double payment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-31_para7"></a>Although there is a logic in allowing those who live in the units a right to seek enforcement of obligations against others, we believe, as a matter of principle, that enforcement should remain between unit owners and the association and that subsection (2)(g) should be deleted for that reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-31_para8"></a>The problems that this provision seeks to overcome can be dealt with by using other legislation or via the provisions of the tenancy agreement. This provision <P>


<a name="column_CWH1244"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1244</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grants tenants of rented units greater rights than they would enjoy elsewhere. Allowing the tenant to offset money paid to the association from that owed to the landlord enables the tenant to protect his own position if the landlord is in default, while ensuring that the overall effect does not see him double charged. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the Minister or the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, whether this would cover the kind of situation that has occurred frequently in the past. I refer to a situation where someone might receive an electricity bill which the tenant in the property knew nothing about; the non-resident landlord, who was perhaps overseas, would fail to pay it and the tenant was then at risk of having the electricity cut off. Is that kind of problem covered? It is quite relevant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Amendments Nos. 55 and 56 affect the rights of tenants. Amendment No. 55 would remove the subsection in Clause 36 that would allow a tenant of a unit-holder to enforce a term of the CCS, the memorandum and articles or some other term of the Act against others in the commonhold. This provision was included to balance the fact that a tenant would be subject, at the minimum, to the terms and conditions of the CCS as part of his lease or other agreement. Clause 19 allows such obligations to be imposed, whatever else the lease may do. It seems to us to be wrong to deny the tenant the protections available in the same document by failing to apply Clause 36(2)(g), which is what Amendment No. 55 would do.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-31_para9"></a>Amendment No. 56 merely duplicates the provisions of Clause 19(3)(a), which provides that any sums paid by the tenant to the commonhold association in default of the unit-holder may be set against sums owed by the tenant, or indeed, under subsection (3)(b), may be recovered from the unit-holder.

<A NAME = "10227-31_para10"></a>There seems to be some sense in Amendment No. 57. If regulations are to make provision for the payment of compensation in certain circumstances, it seems proper that they should be required to say how the necessary calculations are to be made and what provision should be made for late payment. I undertake to come back to the House at Report stage with the definitive answer when we have had an opportunity to discuss this matter with the draftsmen.

<A NAME = "10227-31_para11"></a>As to the point about electricity bills raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, this part of the Bill applies only to matters arising from the memorandum and articles, the CCS or elsewhere in the Bill. It does not cover other matters.

<A NAME = "10227-31_para14"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 36 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   There seems to be far too much provision in this Bill for matters to be covered by regulations. Clause 36 is dispensable and does not appear to be necessary. In law a memorandum and article constitute a contract between members of the company. They can enforce rights conferred on them by the memorandum and articles against each other as a matter of contract law. Would it not be simpler to provide for the commonhold community statement to be binding, as if it were a contract between all the unit-holders for the time being? It may be necessary to add a little to this, for example to provide that obligations are enforceable by the tenants of the unit-holders as well as by and against the unit-holders themselves. But, surely, it is not necessary to have a massive set of regulations to cover these matters. This is overkill and can be done by a much shorter clause that does not involve the making of regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-31_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is a very interesting suggestion. If some way could be found to shorten both the Bill and regulations without damage we would look at it. My first reaction is that Clause 36 is helpful because it sets out in ways which are available to everybody the principles on which the regulations shall be drawn. If, however, it is felt that, unusually, a greater degree of delegation is required--perhaps it is not unusual given the noble Lord's membership of the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee--we are happy to consider the point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-31_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I do not propose a greater degree of delegation; rather, I suggest that this clause can be replaced by a simple one which treats the commonhold community statement as a contract between the members but is extended simply to make it binding on those who buy and on tenants and unit-holders. However, I shall consider that further.

<A NAME="10227-31_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Kingsland </B>   moved Amendment No. 59:

<A NAME = "10227-31_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment would require the directors of the commonhold association to prepare an estimate of expenditure as well as income. The present Clause 37(1)(a) is intended to place an obligation on the directors of the association to prepare an annual budget. We believe that simply requiring an estimate of the income needed is inadequate. This provision could be fulfilled by stating a figure without offering any justification as to how or why that figure was reached. The purpose of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH1246"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1246</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment is to oblige the directors to provide an estimate of expenditure in order to render the budget more precise. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-31_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I do not know why my Amendment No. 60 is grouped with Amendment No. 59, as they do not seem to bear any relationship to one another. However, before speaking to my amendment, I should like to query the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. Is he saying that people will be able to charge on the basis of the projected expenses rather than the actual budget, or is he saying that it will be just a procedure in arriving at the budget? That is quite important as people who have properties in leasehold blocks at the moment often find that people make a budget and charge a great deal of money over what is required. Then at the end of the year they find that the second payment is less but they have been out of pocket all that time on the projected budget.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-31_para19"></a>With regard to my own amendment, it is not connected at all with Amendment No. 59. It deals with a situation that already exists in leasehold property and I believe that it could very easily happen in commonhold. I can quote the instance of a block near where I live where, after 100 per cent of the costs were allocated to all of the people in the building, little niches were discovered, which I believe had been broom cupboards, which were brought into residential use. Those residents had a zero service charge because 100 per cent of the cost was already allocated.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-31_para20"></a>A similar situation occurs where people build another one or two floors on top of a block, which is common practice in London at the moment. It certainly could occur if your commonhold was enlarged. You might be able to extend and build further over what was previously an open space. Therefore, it is most important that, with the inclusion of any additional unit into a commonhold, there should be a complete restructuring of the percentages of costs borne by each resident. Although the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made the point about one person, one vote--it should not matter whether the unit is big or small--the share of the property for which you meet the costs is related to the size of your unit. Even if you hold only one unit, if you have a unit twice the size of the man next door, you will certainly be expected to pay more of the general upkeep of the building.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-31_para21"></a>A real situation arises where 100 per cent is already allocated and, when additional units are brought in, there seems to be no power at the moment to bring those into the reckoning. The people already in the block would then, if anything, have their percentage reduced. It might not mean that their payment was reduced but it would be very wrong if they were paying out costs for the other people.

<A NAME="10227-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   We do not believe that Amendment No. 59 would add anything to the operation of Clause 37(1)(a). At present, that clause requires the directors to make an annual estimate of the income required to meet the expenses of the association. The new words <P>


<a name="column_CWH1247"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1247</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which the amendment would add would require them to prepare an annual statement of projected expenses which the association might reasonably expect to incur. We believe that the added words are implicit in the clause as it stands, because without the projected expenditure, how could there possibly be an annual estimate of the income required to meet that expenditure? We need to be persuaded that the amendment, if carried, would add anything at all to the obvious meaning of the clause. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, that her amendment has nothing to do with the previous amendment, save that it comes in the same part of the Bill. I see the point at which the noble Baroness is driving, but I will do my best to convince her shortly that the job is already done. I invite her to look at Clause 37(1)(c) on page 16 at line 28 and onwards. Any new units in a commonhold must appear as amendments to the commonhold community statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-32_para0"></a>The provision to which I have referred requires the CCS to specify the percentage allocated to each unit--and I emphasise those words, which are in the Bill. That will mean that, however many units there are from time to time, the allocation of the assessment must be made between all of them--always bearing in mind that it is possible to allocate 0 per cent if that is considered appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-32_para1"></a>I hope that that meets the noble Baroness's point and satisfies--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-32_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   Will the Minister give way on that point? This is crucial. He did say "any new unit" but what about a part of a unit? Like my noble friend Lady Gardner, I know a number of examples where parts of the building that were once common parts have been absorbed within a leasehold flat. They would now be absorbed within a commonhold unit, thus altering the useable square footage of that unit. Therefore the percentage of the cost payable should be allowed to be altered by any addition, whether it is a new unit or part of a new unit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl. I am advised that what he suggests--taking over a part of what was common parts into a unit--could not be done without the commonhold community statement being altered. In other words, not even that can be done without the CCS being altered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-32_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   Despite what the Minister says, I have seen that such blocks exist. The landlord and head lessee have chosen not to allocate any costs whatever to the additional area and that has been very unfair to other people in the block. The view has been taken that if we already have 100 per cent we do not need any more. However, people should have the additional proportion taken into account. I am not entirely satisfied that the wording here will ensure that that happens.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   Perhaps I may try to help the noble Lord. This is a very complicated issue. Unfortunately, most of the service charges are based upon the old-fashioned rateable value. That often relates not to the <P>


<a name="column_CWH1248"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1248</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>size of a unit but more to the value at that particular time. It takes no account of how a particular unit within a building may have been improved dramatically and have a higher value.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-32_para2"></a>There is a difficulty. If you have 10 units which contribute 100 per cent of the cost in accordance with their lease, you cannot vary their contribution without mutual agreement on every lease and it is practically impossible to achieve that. However, it was originally suggested that you just make it 104, 105 or 106 per cent, and add 6 per cent, or whatever it might be, on to each additional unit. If it were possible within the Bill to amend the historic service charges being related to rateable value, that would be a wonderful achievement--but I believe it would be nigh on impossible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-32_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   I rise to support both amendments. I shall deal first with the Government's amendment. When we used to have rateable values, when you extended your home--and it could be an extra floor on an apartment building--someone would come along and re-rate you immediately. In other words, you had to pay a greater share of the rates because of your extension of area. There is no doubt that if in a block of flats a number of areas are either extended or taken into account, which were perhaps not used before, the share of the charges should be varied. I agree it is extremely difficult to vary them between a whole group of leases, but if this amendment enables that to be done I strongly support it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-32_para3"></a>I turn to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I did not fully understand the Minister. The noble Lord said that, obviously, one prepared the estimated income required from the expenditure and that was all that was needed. As a tenant of a block of flats, when one receives the service charges one knows exactly what one is required to pay. One does not look at how the income is derived from all the tenants in the building but how the money is to be spent. If one is to examine what the directors or the management company have decided is necessary, one must look very carefully at the detailed elements of expenditure. Only in that way can one judge fairly whether the income that is required for the building is properly derived.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-32_para4"></a>I agree with the Minister's statement that one cannot arrive at the income without having examined the expenditure, but the preparation of a detailed list of required expenditures which comprise the full amount of the required income is very desirable. Today, the occupiers of any modern managed block--I know several people who live in such property--receive very detailed statements every year, sometimes half-yearly, which show how the expenditures have been estimated and how they are being incurred. I strongly support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   We are not persuaded by Amendment No. 59, and we believe that our reply to that is satisfactory. It is for the noble Lord to decide what to do with it.

<A NAME = "10227-32_para5"></a>As to Amendment No. 60, there seems to be some feeling about it. I have tried to persuade the noble Baroness in a few words and failed, and she has not yet persuaded me that her amendment is appropriate. If the noble Baroness is good enough not to move her amendment we can perhaps arrange a meeting between Committee stage and Report to try to persuade each other of our points of view.

That is not the purpose of the reserve fund. The purpose of the reserve fund is to deal with the common and structural parts of the building, including internal structural walls which might form part of a unit but which must remain the responsibility of the association. To have a provision such as this will merely encourage those bad leaseholders, as they are at the moment--in future, unit-holders--to be even more intransigent and difficult to deal with because they know that part of the reserved fund can be used for the repair and maintenance of their unit.

<FONT SIZE=3>is quite important to have a sinking fund or reserve fund. As I understand it, he is suggesting that there should not be one. It is an important part of any unit. When the time comes to sell the unit, whoever is buying will ask about the seller's contribution to the sinking fund or reserve fund. It is used not only for what needs to be done on a routine basis. I have already declared an interest in that I own a flat in a block. There is no reserve fund. We find that a great disadvantage and we would like to have one. The only way to have one would be by getting the agreement of every single leaseholder in the block. It cannot be included at a later stage. I believe that it is important to maintain a reserve fund.

<A NAME="10227-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Amendment No. 63 is grouped with these amendments. On mature reflection, I shall not move that amendment. On the other hand, I should like strongly to support Amendments Nos. 64 and 65, which stand in the name of my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   I had not realised the extent of the sinking fund problem. It ties in with managing agents and irresponsible managing agents, but sinking funds or reserve funds are always held in trust. Presumably they are held in trust on behalf of all the unit-holders. I have worried about a statement in the consultative document on which people have commented. Management is a very trying business and unless it is clear, and unless issues such as this are clear, there is only friction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-33_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   Perhaps I may speak to Amendment No. 64 in my name, which seems to have become somewhat muddled with everything else. It is strange how my amendments are being grouped. If someone is making a demand for payment the date on which the payment is due should be quite clear on the document, particularly since, as has been mentioned by other Members of the Committee, we are all keen to charge interest to those who have not paid. It is important to know when one has to pay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   The provision that Amendment No. 62 seeks to delete is not as odd as it might seem at first blush. In a sizeable commonhold development it might be thought convenient to have a caretaker living on site. In a commonhold sheltered community, a warden would be expected to live on site. In a very large commonhold development, the community association or its managing agents might well find it convenient to use an easily accessible unit as an office. Of course, the unit could be redefined as part of the common parts, but we believe that retaining it as a unit could have advantages of flexibility and adaptability. For example, if one wanted to change where the caretaker's flat was, it would be easier to do so by making it a unit rather than a common part.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-33_para0"></a>A commonhold association owning a unit or units for those purposes must have power to raise funds to maintain them. The power to raise funds in Clause 38(1)(a) applies to common parts, and these units are not common parts; they are units, the unit-holder of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>which is the commonhold association itself. The commonhold association must be able to meet its responsibilities to maintain and insure such units. That is what Clause 38(1)(b) allows: no more, no less.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-33_para1"></a>Amendment No. 64 seems on the face of it to be entirely reasonable. It would add to the certainty of the collection of levies for reserve funds. Indeed, if the logic of the amendment for this purpose were accepted, consideration should also be given to applying it to the notice to be issued for the collection of commonhold assessments under Clause 37(1)(e). I invite the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, to withdraw her amendment today. I shall undertake to discover whether there are any hidden difficulties that we have not spotted in relation to her suggestion. If there are no such hidden problems, we shall come back on Report with a similar amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-33_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I am happy with that. My other amendment, which has already been debated, could be dealt with in the same way and the two examined together. Again, it is a question of the interest running on the money.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-33_para2"></a>
I make this suggestion in order to ensure that the issue is more specific and fair. At the moment, although the Minister said that it means no more and no less, that is not what it says in the Bill. How it can be interpreted? It can be interpreted as any unit in the block or in the development. I wonder whether the Minister would consider the possibility of such an amendment between now and another stage.

This implied that with a trust arrangement they would not. Amendment No. 67 is intended to permit sums from the reserve fund to be used to pay debt if that would avoid insolvency.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-33_para9"></a>We recognise that the prohibition imposed by subsection (4) is probably intended to protect the fund against third party garnishees. However, we consider that the flexibility would be helpful. I beg to move.

<A NAME = "10227-33_para10"></a>On looking at the status of a reserve fund, it seems to me that there are two possibilities. The first possibility is that the fund is the property of the CHA, which would mean that if it was not used for the purpose for which it was set up it could be used to meet the debts of the company in the case of insolvency. The other basic possibility is that the fund is a trust fund. If that was not used for the purpose for which it was set up, it would have to be returned to the unit-holders who had contributed to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-33_para11"></a>The Government here respond with something very close to the first of those possibilities. Clause 38(4) restricts the use of the fund to the purposes for which it was set up and prevents the enforcement against the fund for other purposes. However, Clause 54 overrides that and allows the fund to be used to pay the debts of an insolvent CHA.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-33_para12"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, goes for the trust fund solution, although it does not specify that the fund under Clause 38 is necessarily a trust fund. If it is, I am a little puzzled by Amendment No. 57 which would enable the reserve fund under Clause 38 to be resorted to in order to stave off an insolvency. Logically, if the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is going for a trust solution, he should also object to Clause 54 standing part of the Bill, which he has not done.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-33_para13"></a>Our Amendment No. 73 goes for the half-way house, which is intended to exempt a reserve fund from going to the creditors if a succession order is made and a phoenix association is set up. That would also require an amendment to Clause 49 to ensure that the reserve fund goes to the phoenix association, along with the common parts. We certainly believe that the reserve fund should go to the phoenix association to enable it to continue to operate. "Phoenix association" is an informal term for a successor CHA which is set up to take over the assets of an insolvent predecessor.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-33_para14"></a>We believe that our solution is appropriate. I am tempted to go further and support the trust solution, where there is no phoenix association and the reserve fund goes back to the contributors if no succession order is made. However, I also recognise that the position is not quite the same in the case of commonhold as it is between landlord and leaseholder.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-33_para15"></a>It is quite plain--we will come on to this later with other amendments--that, in the case of a reserve fund which is paid over by lessees to a landlord, there is every reason to insist on that being a trust fund. I recognise that, in the case of a commonhold where the fund is paid by the unit-holders, in effect, to a company which represents themselves, the arguments for a trust fund are not quite so strong. I shall wait with interest to hear what the Minister has to say on that point.

<A NAME="10227-34_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   Again, I do not know why my Amendment No. 74 is popped in here; the pages do not seem to be related.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-34_para0"></a>I should like to comment briefly on the amendments which relate to reserve funds. Having spoken so strongly in favour of reserve funds, I should mention <P>


<a name="column_CWH1254"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1254</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that I met a woman the other day who manages her own block of flats, which was sold by a Duke to the Wellcome Trust. By the time she bought her flat in the early 1980s, a reserve fund of £100,000 had accumulated. She took over the management personally with the agreement of the other tenants in the block. She has run it since 1985 and has never needed to levy any money for repairs. They are still living on that £100,000. If we have a reserve fund, or a sinking fund, it is important that there should be some control over it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-34_para1"></a>Amendment No. 74 has been tabled because I found the provision at page 23 very strange. It states that the property would cease to be commonhold, but it did not state what it would become when that happened. It is very important that, if people are unit-holders, they are owners of that basic piece of property. Even if it was all burnt down, it would end up still being theirs, and I think it should be freehold at that point. This is why I have tabled Amendment No. 74.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I shall deal first with Amendment No. 66, which would import into the Bill a provision lifted almost bodily from Section 42 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. In the 1987 Act, this provision was designed to protect the interests of tenants paying into accumulated funds by way of service charges, by requiring the landlord or his agent, whoever held the fund, to hold it on trust for the tenants.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-34_para2"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, recognised, the relationship between the commonhold association and the unit-holder differs in almost every respect from that between a tenant and his landlord or his landlord's agent. Apart from what might be seen as a natural reluctance to import into the Bill the setting up of a new kind of ownership--a provision from the landlord and tenant law--we do not think we need it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-34_para3"></a>Because of the relationship between the commonhold association and the unit-holder, there is no need to set up a complex structure designed to provide protection against a problem which will not exist. There should never be a conflict of interest between the commonhold association and its members such that it would be necessary to create trusts as in the 1987 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-34_para4"></a>So far as tax is concerned, we do not believe that receipts by the company--that is, the commonhold association--would be taxable in the way that the fund accruing under the 1987 Act would be, as it would be a company asset and not a taxable asset of the unit-holder. I will check on that point and I undertake to write to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about it before Report stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-34_para5"></a>The noble Lord did not speak to Amendment No. 67, so perhaps I should not speak to it either.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I thought I had, and I have been duly reprimanded for what I said by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. In the circumstances, I am rather glad that you do not remember.

<a name="column_CWH1255"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1255</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>No. 67 would make the reserve fund available to a creditor if the enforcement of a debt would render the commonhold association liable to a winding-up petition under Section 24 of the Insolvency Act 1986. A petition leading to winding up can be used as a blunt instrument by an alleged creditor to extract money from an alleged debtor. The essence is that a court can find insolvency not because the commonhold association could not pay its debts (which could be as small as £75) but that, for whatever reason, it did not. A heavy-handed alleged creditor can use the threat of insolvency as a first line of attack on a debtor.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-34_para6"></a>The purpose of Clause 38(4) is to protect what we acknowledge may not be the most efficiently run companies from becoming easy prey to unscrupulous contractors. Clause 54 provides that where a court has been satisfied that winding up is appropriate, or the commonhold association passes a voluntary winding up resolution, or the court makes a declaration that the land is no longer commonhold, the reserve fund is released.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-34_para7"></a>As to Amendment No. 73, we recognised that Clause 38(4) gives what some have thought to be an unusual degree of protection to the reserve funds of commonhold associations. In effect, it provides that reserve funds should not be available to judgment debtors to satisfy debts unless those debts arise directly from works or the provision of services for which the reserve fund was established. If you had a garden contractor paid on a weekly basis out of a current account, he would not be able to get at the reserve fund for outstanding fees but a lift engineer, carrying out periodic lift replacement, which is paid for out of the reserve fund, would have access to it. Therefore, we believe that the degree of protection is not unreasonable, but in addition a commonhold association which has been managed in such a way as to face winding up should no longer be protected in that way. It would be grossly unfair to creditors if a commonhold association got away with insolvency and kept what might be a considerable asset intact to be passed on to a successor association. I am afraid that that is what this amendment would do.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-34_para8"></a>If the commonhold association has got itself into such a mess that the court believes winding up is the way to deal with it, it must pay up and the creditors should be recompensed as fully as possible. If it means that the successor association gets under way with no reserve funds, it is for the directors to find an alternative way to manage things until those funds can be built up again.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-34_para9"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 74. I apologise that the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, was not consulted on the grouping. Commonhold land continues to be freehold land when it is registered as commonhold. It must be freehold land to begin with. A unit-holder is defined as the person who is entitled in law to be registered as the proprietor of the freehold estate in his unit. The land takes on certain statutorily defined special attributes during the time that it is registered as commonhold which are, however, in addition to its underlying freehold status. When it ceases to be commonhold for any reason it merely sheds those <P>


<a name="column_CWH1256"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1256</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>attributes. Its underlying freehold nature has not been disturbed and it does not need to become freehold again. As the clause provides, it needs to stop being commonhold.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I thank the Minister for his observations.

He asked how the debts would be held on transfer to a successor commonhold association and what would be done about members who do not pay. The debts of the original insolvent commonhold association will be its debts and not those of the successor commonhold association. The liquidator will have the full range of powers given by the Insolvency Act to collect the insolvent commonhold association's assets which will include arrears owed to it by unit-holders, and the liquidator will be able to seek a charging order over such unit-holders' property including his unit. That point was made in response to the question posed earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I hope that satisfies the noble Earl.

It is essential that commonhold associations act on the basis of the best, current and up-to-date information. I recognise that in practice the best way of doing this is electronically; and no doubt there will be a website where these regulations will be maintained.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para8"></a>It is worth raising the point that it will be essential for information to be brought to the attention of the commonhold association. One practical way of doing that would be by ensuring that all of them--they can all equally be identified from the Land Registry--receive copies of the regulations free of charge. as soon as they are made or, in the case of draft regulations from the affirmative resolution procedure, before they come into force.

In the early stages there will be very few such organisations to be supplied. However, we have to consider the cost to the taxpayers of providing such material free of charge to companies which will levy commonhold assessments on their unit-holders for the very purpose of, among other things, covering the costs of managing the commonhold.

If it is going to do that, it needs to include all elements where there can be a right to manage. One of those areas needs to be those properties which have been enfranchised and are on an estate. That does not exist at the present time. There are estate management schemes, but the right to manage does not exist under those schemes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para25"></a>This amendment and Amendment No. 190 are designed to ensure that properties enfranchised by their owners, the owners then have the right to manage on the estate. This will probably include areas where there are flats with leasehold, but those owners should not be deprived of the rights of tenants under the Landlord and Tenant Act.

<A NAME = "10227-35_para26"></a>Many promises have been made during the passage of the Bill. One was made, I believe, by the Minister for Housing, when he conceded some time ago that this measure would be appropriate. I therefore have no doubt that the amendment will be accepted by the Minister. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-35_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My noble friend Lord Richard is unable to be present--he is attending the funeral of Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos in Anglesey--and therefore my noble friend Lady Gibson of Market Rasen and I shall be moving the amendments standing in his name on the Marshalled List.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para27"></a>Amendment No. 83A is self-explanatory. It is an attempt to extend the right to manage across a whole estate. Within the present definition, where RTM is contemplated for an estate comprising, say, six separate blocks of flats, each building must satisfy eligibility and make application separately. This is unnecessarily bureaucratic, more expensive in legal costs and could cause problems in the management of common areas in estate-wide contracts if only one or two of the blocks proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para28"></a>It may be convenient if I speak also to Amendment No. 89A, which attempts to define an "estate" for the purposes I have mentioned. The Minister will be aware of the problem and be sympathetic to it, but there will be difficulties in compiling a watertight definition of an estate that will not end up encompassing all the properties in a landlord's ownership. We propose that an "estate" should relate to the service charge for buildings and lands which together comprise 100 per cent of the charge levied.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para29"></a>The second issue arises from concerns expressed by the Association of Retirement Housing Managers about the possible effects of the exercise of RTM on flats on retirement estates which comprise both flats and bungalows and which have shared facilities--a warden, a common room, a laundry and so on. Again, the application must be estate wide for proper or possible future management.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-35_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I rise to support both the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Richard. As your Lordships are well aware, the amendments would extend the right to manage to cover estates of buildings. At present it applies only to blocks of flats. The estate is defined as having an appropriate degree of commonality in arrangements and service charges. The buildings must make up the entire estate. Leasehold houses are only included where the estate is designated as a retirement estate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para30"></a>Under the Bill as drafted, blocks of flats on estates of linked buildings will not be able to exercise the right to manage as a group. Individual blocks will only qualify for RTM if the common areas, services and service charges can be disaggregated. This mirrors the position in relation to enfranchisement. The crucial question is the degree of commonality between the buildings-- that is, the extent to which they share arrangements, areas and services--and the ease with which these can be separated.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH1261"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1261</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para31"></a>The amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, define the estate so that it applies to estates where the commonality is such that the individual buildings cannot be separated. Even as the Bill stands, there will be estates where there will be blocks of flats able to exercise RTM, leaving the landlord compelled to retain the management of the surrounding houses. If the management of the common areas and services of the estate are linked in such a way that it is unreasonably difficult to disaggregate them, it should be possible for the entire estate to exercise RTM. A whole linked estate would need to achieve the appropriate majorities among the leaseholders. It will be important to clarify whether the qualification and majorities required should be assessed for each individual block or across the entire estate. Otherwise it is conceivable that confusion could arise where there is not a majority for RTM in any individual block but that there might be across the entire estate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para32"></a>Our concern with allowing RTM to apply to estates is that it may have a seriously adverse impact on the ability to manage an estate as an estate, particularly if the concept of commonality were drawn widely. This could have a significantly adverse effect, for example, on some of the London estates where, arguably, the ability of the landlord to manage the estate has been an important factor in maintaining the quality of the area, establishing a sense of place and community and preserving and enhancing the value of the leaseholders' assets.

<A NAME="10227-35_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Lord Whitty): </B>  As the Committee will have noticed, we have now moved on to the part of the Bill which is the responsibility of my department on the leasehold side. These amendments attempt to extend the people and premises to which the rights to manage apply, from those outlined in Clause 69, to estates or people who are subject to an estate management scheme. They should have the collective right to take over the running of that scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para33"></a>I have some sympathy with the concerns behind this proposal and with the suggestion as regards the problem that it addresses. Indeed, the noble Baroness is correct to say that Nick Raynsford himself made some general statements recognising that it might be desirable to move in this direction--although he stopped short of giving a specific commitment that it would be possible to do so in this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para34"></a>I fear that the Committee will hear me say on a number of occasions that although these extensions may well be desirable they would be extremely complex to implement. It would be very difficult to implement them in the terms of the amendments before us and to resolve the matter in time for measures to be brought forward in this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para35"></a>Estate management schemes are intended to preserve arrangements for the management of an estate where leaseholders exercise the right to enfranchise either individual leasehold houses or <P>


<a name="column_CWH1262"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1262</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>blocks of flats. In the absence of positive covenants which might run with the land, they are needed to enforce binding obligations on those who own the freehold of their property in order to contribute to the upkeep of common facilities within the estate as a whole. We are therefore left with a mixed community of the original landlord, freehold tenants of individual buildings on the estate and the leaseholders.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para36"></a>The problem facing us is that we need to consider very carefully the respective rights and obligations of all these parties and how they might inter-relate within what is intended to be quite a simple structure of an RTM company. This is an extremely complex issue. The fact of the matter is that we have not been able to address this within the time available. We would certainly be prepared, as a Government, to consider it in the longer term in the light of experience on the more straightforward premises and rights in this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para37"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lea, on behalf of my noble friend Lord Richard, proposes a more general right to allow the right to manage to be exercised for an estate of properties of all descriptions. Many of the points I have already made relate to this--we have given careful thought to the possibility of creating a right to manage applying to more than one property. That was raised very substantially during the consultation in August and we had to face a number of practical difficulties which, although potentially soluble, could not be satisfactorily resolved in time for measures to be brought forward for this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para38"></a>The first and most obvious question was that of the definition of "estate" for these purposes. The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, makes a helpful suggestion, but there are other issues that would need to be resolved. As has been said, there are estates which consist of a mixture of flats, of maisonettes and of houses. A retirement estate is a clear example of this in many parts of the country. There will be differences between the rights of leaseholders of houses and leaseholders of flats--some as a result of historic accidents and others for more substantive reasons. We need to address both.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-35_para39"></a>We have to recognise that on a complex estate the question of which services apply to which premises is also complex. Some services may apply to the estate as a whole and all residents contribute to service charges; others may apply only to a particular block, individual buildings or groups of buildings. To make sense of that, we would need rather more complicated amendments to the Bill than are proposed in these clauses. We agree that this is an important issue and that it may be desirable for the right to manage to be capable of being extended to people in these situations. However, one cannot simply extend the rights which apply to people in single properties to those who live on estates. That would be a matter for complex amendment or, in our judgment, a later Bill, by which time we would be able to take account of the experience of the more straightforward application of RTM in individual buildings. I, therefore, hope that the noble Baroness will not pursue the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 84 I shall speak to a number of other amendments in the same grouping. This part of the Bill gives tenants the right to manage the block in which their flats are located. It is worth recapping the law at present. Probably, for as long as leases have existed some landlords have ignored their responsibilities for the maintenance of the premises. Historically, the High Court had the power to appoint a receiver of a block of flats where the landlord was in breach of his duties under a lease. Due to the expense this was rarely an attractive option for tenants.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para4"></a>The Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 simplified the procedure considerably, as many noble Lords are aware. After a number of statutory improvements, the present position is that tenants have the power to apply to the leasehold valuation tribunal for the appointment of a manager. In order to appoint a manager the tenant must show, in short, that the landlord is not carrying out his functions properly, so that in effect there is some misbehaviour on the part of the landlord.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para5"></a>The leasehold valuation tribunal determines whether the landlord is at fault and it is sensible to appoint a manager. I believe that noble Lords who are familiar with this branch of the law will agree that that has been a useful power to remedy the problem of landlords who have ignored their duties or, in some cases, have disappeared altogether.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para6"></a>The proposed right to manage, however, is quite different. A perfectly good landlord is liable to have his management function terminated at the tenants' whim. Those on this side of the Committee believe that there is considerable objection to the way that the Government propose to introduce the new power. The landlord has an interest in keeping the property in good condition so that his reversion keeps its value. The problem is likely to be especially acute in cases where leases have only a fairly short time to run. Tenants in such a case, understandably, are likely to be most unwilling to spend money on major items of repair. That is likely to reduce, significantly, the value of the landlord's reversion.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para7"></a>The effect of the proposed right to manage is that in the country as a whole less money will be spent on building maintenance than otherwise would be the <P>


<a name="column_CWH1264"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1264</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>case. We have in this country, in comparison to many other countries, a fairly old housing stock. In order to keep this housing stock in good condition, it is vital that there is regular expenditure of reasonable sums of money on repairs. We are concerned that there is no adequate remedy for a landlord to ensure that tenants who exercise the right to manage carry out proper repairs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para8"></a>The second matter is that a landlord's right to manage is a valuable one. Merely by way of example, there is currently a strong demand for freehold reversions, simply for the commission on their insurance premiums. Equally, as regards repairs, the landlord is obliged under current law to obtain competitive quotations for works. Having obtained quotes, there is no objection to a landlord using a building company which he owns to carry out the work, so long as the quote put in by the company is the lowest. The landlord can then, I submit quite legitimately, make a profit on the building work. Taking away the landlord's right to manage is, in principle, expropriative.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para9"></a>There seems to be a human rights problem here. Article 1 of the first protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights protects rights of property. It is quite true that the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights gives member states considerable leeway in determining the extent to which interference with property rights is permissible. One has only to think of the Duke of Westminster's case, James v. the United Kingdom, where he challenged the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, giving householders holding long leases the right to buy their houses at a low price. The court in Strasbourg held that that was justifiable on social grounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para10"></a>Here, however, it is difficult to see what pressing social need there is to stop good landlords--and I emphasise the word "good"--managing properties in which they hold a reversion. Our approach to this part of the Bill, therefore, is to seek to make improvements in the legislation and to make it human rights compliant.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para11"></a>The effect of the proposed amendments to Clause 69 is to prevent there being any automatic right to have an RTM company appointed in mixed developments, where there are both residential and business premises. The reason for excluding mixed use developments is this: business premises are usually let on short, or shortish, leases, with a variety of terms as to repairs. Sometimes the business tenant is responsible for repairs; sometimes the landlord is responsible for repairs but is expected to meet these repairs from the rent. On the ending of a business tenancy, there is often a claim for dilapidations from the landlord. In other words, there is a very close relationship between the landlord and the business tenant where great care is taken to set out the precise rights and obligations of the parties between themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para12"></a>Commercial tenants expect a professional landlord with professional knowledge. The Bill, as presently drafted, will vest the duty to manage business premises in the RTM company. The business tenant will not be <P>


<a name="column_CWH1265"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1265</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a shareholder in the RTM company and will not have any control over the RTM company. The people who control the RTM company will be the residential tenants. The landlord will, on the Government's proposals, be a shareholder in the RTM company but will have no veto and no right even to sit on the board of directors. Therefore, in certain circumstances, it may be unfair to a commercial tenant to have the management of a block taken from the hands of a professional commercial landlord and placed in the hands of the residential tenants. It is doubly so, when the commercial tenant has no say in the conduct of the management of the block.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para13"></a>Moreover, there are liable to be enormous conflicts of interest between the commercial tenants and the residential tenants. This is most marked in cases where the commercial tenant is paying a rent inclusive of a service charge. The landlord has an interest in keeping the building in first-class condition so that he can keep the tenant at the expiry of the tenant's lease. The residential tenant's interest is keeping the service charge rather lower. The Bill at present provides no means of squaring this particular circle.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para14"></a>We suggest that the only sensible way forward is to move mixed developments from the scope of the right to manage. The effect of removing mixed use developments from the right to manage will not be to prejudice residential tenants. The reason is that where a landlord is guilty of bad management, the right to have a manager appointed under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 will remain.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para15"></a>It is for this reason that a consequential amendment is proposed to Schedule 13 to the Bill--the repeal schedule--so as to keep unchanged the leasehold valuation tribunal's powers to appoint managers. I therefore commend the amendment to the Committee. I beg to move.

<A NAME="10227-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 85 to 88, which stand in my name and in the name of my noble friend Lady Hamwee. We have had what could be described as a Second Reading speech from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I understand why he made it because it explains the background to the amendments which he is proposing to introduce, and it is of assistance to the Committee.

I should say that we also recognise that there will in practice be many cases where, for various reasons, the tenants or a sufficient number of tenants will be happy <P>


<a name="column_CWH1266"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1266</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with what the landlord does and will not wish to take on the responsibility for the management themselves and will not seek to set up an RTM company. That is perfectly reasonable. But we think it is a matter on which the tenants should have a choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para16"></a>I turn now to the substance of our amendments in this group. The issues raised are similar to the question of flying freehold or flying commonholds which were raised by us in amendments which were discussed on the first day of Committee stage. This is not a case of flying freeholds or flying commonholds because nothing in this group of amendments affects the nature of the interest in the property as such. We wish to see a possibility of dividing the responsibility for management between different parts of the same building if they are self-contained, whether on a horizontal or vertical basis, so that they could apply, for instance, to the flats in a block which had shops below and flats above, the flats being self-contained in the sense of having a separate entrance, separate facilities and not having any common part shared with the shops.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para17"></a>In that case, if the flat lessees want to form an RTM company, they will obviously take over the landlord's responsibilities for performing the maintenance and other obligations in respect of the flats. What happens to the shops? Of course, under the present legislation, it will be possible to have a single RTM unit if the shop takes up to 25 per cent of the space. However, what we propose here is the possibility of an alternative course which in no way intends to exclude the other possibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para18"></a>There are two solutions. The first is that the landlord retains the obligations in relation to the shops. That would be workable only if the landlord and the RTM were willing to enter into an agreement for the division of responsibilities. The other alternative would be to allow the RTM to take over the management of the whole building. It might, of course, be a disincentive to forming an RTM company, but there has to be either a single management or co-operative management and we cannot disregard the physical nature of the strategy of the building.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-36_para19"></a>If flat owners want to exercise the right to manage and are able to enter into an agreement with the landlord or are willing to take over the management of the whole building, one could say, "Why not?". I believe that that could be done without too much additional qualification.

<A NAME="10227-37_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   In speaking to Amendment No. 89, my noble friend Lady Gibson of Market Rasen and I are grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. In one respect, the thrust of the approach we set out has also been reflected by the statement made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para0"></a>Whereas the right to enfranchise must take the whole block into consideration, that is quite unnecessary and counter-productive when it comes to the right to manage. The actual management of residential parts in these situations is usually quite separate from the management of the shops or restaurants. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said <P>


<a name="column_CWH1267"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1267</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that there is very little common interest between the shops and the residential parts. Indeed--this could be a point of further clarification and is implicit in what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said--normally there will be separate front doors and separate access and it is normally quite clear from the point of view of service charges that there is a separation between the residential and commercial parts. This could be clarified by surveyors.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para1"></a>It is true--this is not something one has to concede-- it is an obvious ex hypothesi that the freeholder would still appoint the managing agent for the shops. Where is the problem in that? All that would happen would be that the freeholder would be dealing with the same two management categories as at present. At present, he is dealing with the management category "commercial" and the management category "residential".
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para2"></a>Giving the residents the right to manage would give them the right to appoint the managing agent if they wished to take on the responsibilities set out. They may not always wish to do that, but this is the potential right that would be adduced. It also sheds light, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, on the 25 per cent threshold maximum for the commercial share if the RTM right is to be exercised.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para3"></a>Let me just consider a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, whereby the residents consider taking over the RTM option where the share is 20 per cent below the threshold. They have the right to do that, which is set out in Schedule 6. Why should they have to exercise the management right vis-a-vis the commercial parts? There is no reason at all that I can see, and yet we are told that it is essential. Perhaps the Minister would confirm that this is indeed the implication and that those of us who have spoken have not misunderstood that that is what is being said.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para4"></a>The two amendments would eliminate--we all agree that there are several ways of doing this--the 25 per cent threshold but, more importantly, they would change the basis of the RTM to the residential parts. I put it to the Minister that that would be a far more plausible proposition than whether the figure was 15 per cent, 20 per cent or indeed 40 per cent. Does the Minister disagree with that? That is much more relevant than the percentage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para5"></a>Incidentally, the argument that the 25 per cent is needed to identify a division above which the value of the freehold is split roughly 50/50 in value--that is adduced because of the higher value per square foot of the commercial parts--is a concept which seems to have been conceived in the context of the right to enfranchise. I do not know whether someone's word processor has got stuck, and that is why we see 25 per cent appearing on the right to manage, but the logic is quite different. It is inappropriate to adduce that as a consideration here.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para6"></a>Finally, if it is suggested that this amendment would change the very delicate balance of the Bill between the legitimate interests who have been consulted, I have to say that I have had a good deal of correspondence and <P>


<a name="column_CWH1268"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1268</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many conversations now. The main property interests are not opposing it, as I understand it and, indeed, we have the support which is adduced here today.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para7"></a>The final subsection of Amendment No. 89 provides for arbitration of any dispute on the extent of residential parts. That does not create a new precedent as this is precisely the sort of demarcation that is necessary for the application of service charges at the moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para8"></a>The Government may have firmly grasped the wrong end of the stick on this point. I hope we can look at this point--and not in the longer term. I know that Members of the Committee will be familiar with the statement by Lord Keynes that, in the long run, we are all dead. That is rather too close to home in this context. But why the longer term? The difficulties have been addressed and there should be time for the Government. We do not know how this will progress in the time set down, and timescales may open up so that this Bill has more room for examination. We do not know what will happen in the next few weeks. But these matters have been discussed extremely thoroughly and there should be some scope to address this point before we reach a conclusion.

<A NAME="10227-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   I have some problems with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I agree with him that the idea of having the residents of a block of flats being responsible for the management of a commercial undertaking--usually retail shops on the ground floor--is, as I have always thought, somewhat absurd. However, the idea that we should reverse it and allow the landlords effectively to appoint managers for the shops and for the flats would, in my opinion, be going backwards. He mentioned that, at the moment, there is a strong demand for freehold reversionary interest to obtain the insurance commission. Members of the Committee have no doubt read the deeper meaning of that, which means that the landlords should not trouble to get the lowest possible insurance because that would give them less commission. That is not an encouragement and is one reason we want to see flats having the right to manage their own properties.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para9"></a>I would like to ask the Minister why it has never been possible to separate the retail shops entirely from the residential blocks located above. One could, for example, insert a 999-year lease between the freeholder and the shops, which would make it possible for the shops to be managed separately and the flats to be enfranchised, or whatever, thus providing an alternative structure. At the moment, however, it should remain that the flats have the right to form their own RTM.

<A NAME="10227-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Selsdon: </B>   This is an occasion on which all sides of the Committee agree and on which the Government have tried to do things in the interest of harmonious relationship but have probably failed. It is quite idiotic to try to bring commercial and residential management together. The structures that exist <P>


<a name="column_CWH1269"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1269</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>historically are not clean and neat. While the residents in the mixed block may well hold a direct lease with the freeholder, sometimes they may hold indirect leases and commercial property may often be on franchises, or let, or there may several intermediate landlords.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para10"></a>Moreover, usually or from time to time there is a conflict between the residents and those of the commercial property. It may relate to opening hours, to noise, to parking by customers or to signs. It may relate to a whole range of issues. Therefore, if the spirit of the Bill is harmonious relationship, as drafted in terms of right-to-management, it is likely to lead to disharmony. It would seem logical, therefore, to separate the two. The idea of a group of residents in a large block, who have never managed a property in their lives, forming a company and coming together to try to manage it strikes me as very difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para11"></a>There is an alternative which is within current procedure. If a landlord wishes to appoint a managing agent rather than manage a property himself, he or she is required to choose three alternatives and receive three proposals for management by professional, competent agencies. They are not always obliged to take the cheapest but to take the one that will provide best value. It seems that in mixed development, if one is unable to separate the management of the commercial property from the residential property one should try to adopt some formula like this, where both sides are required or have the right to appoint an independent managing agent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   These amendments focus broadly on the same area, although that of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, ranged somewhat more widely, which may perhaps have been appropriate for early discussions of this part of the Bill. However, I shall resist responding to that part of it and concentrate on the amendments. I was not entirely clear where the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, stood on this because his name was attached to two amendments that appeared to move in precisely opposite directions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para12"></a>Amendment No. 84, to which he spoke, is effectively attempting to propose that the right to manage should not apply to any property to which a business tenancy also applies. On the other hand, his support of the Amendment No. 89, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, is effectively to provide for virtually the same thing. There seems to be some confusion here. It is a complex area and I shall deal with the fundamentalist opposition of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, to what is provided here. It is that in certain circumstances where there is a business tenancy we provide for the residential element to have a right to manage the company, whereas the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Lea of Crondall, are looking for an extension to that right.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para13"></a>We all probably agree that apart from the first amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in certain circumstances there should be that right.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para14"></a>Amendment No. 84 suggests that we disapply the right to manage for all properties with a business tenancy. We have significant difficulties with that. The right to manage is intended to allow leaseholders who <P>


<a name="column_CWH1270"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1270</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have a majority stake in the property--which is our dividing line; I shall return to the issue when I deal with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lea--to take over the management of that property.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para15"></a>Amendment No. 84 would have the opposite effect. Theoretically, at least, it would prevent leaseholders who have acquired 99 per cent of a property on long leases from being able to manage the block simply because of the presence of another 1 per cent which was not in that category. Your Lordships may say that that is a ludicrous situation which would never arise, but it underlines the importance of my point. By saying that one cannot exercise the right to manage any property where there is a business tenancy, one directly creates a tremendous incentive for a landlord to engineer a way of letting a small part of the property on a business lease. At its most extreme, a broom cupboard suddenly becomes an office or an attic becomes a factory. That may seem absurd but, nevertheless, we know that a number of scams have operated. We have to ensure that unscrupulous landlords are not allowed to seize on such a loophole. Amendment No. 84 is therefore not within the spirit of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para16"></a>My noble friend Lord Lea accused us of getting hold of the wrong end of the stick. To some extent, his amendment and the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, also get hold of the wrong end of the stick. It may not be the same stick.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-37_para17"></a>The position is not that the right-to-manage company takes on the responsibility for the management of the business unit--indeed, subsection (6)(a) has the effect of preventing the RTM company from becoming directly responsible for the management of any flat or unit which is not on a long lease; in other words, a remaining tenanted flat or a business premise, shop, restaurant or whatever--but it will be responsible to everyone, including renting and commercial tenants, for maintaining the common part and fabric of that property.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   To what clause does subsection (6)(a) refer?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   It refers to Clause 93. It is not the case that we would be in a difficult situation were the RTM company to take on the direct management of the internal affairs of the business premises; it is only the fabric of the building that we are talking about.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-38_para0"></a>As to the threshold above which the residential part has the right to manage, my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall says that the idea that one must roughly assess where the dividing line arises is not appropriate. I believe it is. A rough indication is that the RTM would become available only where the non-domestic element of the block was no greater than 25 per cent. That 25 per cent equates to the 75 per cent which would thereby remain in residential ownership.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   I hope it is possible in this procedure for me to intervene to ask my noble friend a question. Does not his most recent remark depend on the presumption that the right to manage would cover <P>


<a name="column_CWH1271"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1271</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the residential and the commercial sections? One would then have the concept of an equity majority. If we are talking about a separate right to manage, where does the question of the minority dominating the majority--which is my noble friend's argument--arise?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My noble friend's amendment appears to address the right to manage not only the leasehold flats but all the common parts. I am referring to the outer fabric. The management company would become responsible for the outer fabric of the building and for the services which are common to the building as a whole. The difficulty arises if it is responsible only for less than half the putative value of the property, which was why we arrived at 25 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-38_para1"></a>As to the management of the fabric and the common services, it is important that those aspects remain in one pair of hands; otherwise, if responsibility for the integrity of the fabric is unclear there is endless scope for confusion, disputes and risk to occupants. There are also issues to do with insurance and the split between the landlord, or the landlord's agent, as regards the management of the non-domestic parts and the leaseholder as regards the domestic aspects. It is to some extent an arbitrary threshold. However, where they are responsible for more than half the value of the property that is a sensible point at which to establish the threshold.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-38_para2"></a>To allow the residential leaseholders to take management control over matters which are strictly internal to the domestic parts and closely associated common parts, such as stairways, would not be of huge value, in the sense that again there would be a risk of constant arguments about exactly where responsibilities began and ended.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-38_para3"></a>I recognise the importance of this issue. Approximately 10 per cent of all leasehold premises are mixed use, but it is not entirely clear whether the whole of that would fall under this criterion. Nevertheless, it is a significant proportion of the leasehold market and, therefore, it may well be desirable that some rights should be extended to everybody who is in that situation. However, these are hugely complex issues. Were we to move down the road suggested in the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Lea the complexities would have to be addressed by much more detailed amendments than simply the addition of the set of tenants to the list of those who are eligible. Regrettably, at the moment there is little that we can offer to residential leaseholders in this area where there is a high--over 25 per cent--non-residential component.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-38_para4"></a>Amendments Nos. 85 to 88 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, produce an even more wide-ranging extension, in that they change the definition of a self-contained part of a building. That would allow the right to management to be extended to a horizontally-separated part of a building provided it had a separate entrance. In certain circumstances that would lead to ridiculous situations. Let us consider a row of terraced houses, each of which is divided into two flats, one up and one down. Theoretically, the <P>


<a name="column_CWH1272"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1272</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment would allow two neighbouring top floor flats to combine together to exercise the right to manage, provided that they could have a separate entrance. What happens to the two downstairs flats? How do they address the problem of the fabric or the roof over the top flat which is leaking downstairs onto their own woodwork? Again, it is a question of who is responsible for what and to whom. To extend the right to any geographically adjacent flats compounds the difficulties which are inherent in the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Lea. Therefore, I am concerned that we would enter into even greater complexity if we adopted the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-38_para5"></a>Without going into all the complexities, we believe that it is much preferable to ensure that the whole block is subject, as far as practicable, to the same management regime for the fabric of the building. We believe that to make exemptions from that, and to make extensions to different sub-parts of the building, undermines the simplicity of the right and the way in which the building is managed thereafter.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-38_para6"></a>We hope that, given all these practical problems--we do not disagree with the principle--all noble Lords who are concerned with this group of amendments recognise that they will not achieve what they want, and to achieve more would go beyond the nature of the Bill that we are currently proposing.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Of course we understand the Government's desire to harmonise procedures under the legislation as far as possible, and entirely accept the important wish of residential leaseholders to gain greater control of the properties in which they live. But requiring them to take on the commercial elements in a mixed use building adds an unnecessary complication, as my noble friend Lord Selsdon said. I believe that is the view from all parts of the Committee. At Second Reading a noble Lord asked why someone who has a residential flat above, say, a well-known London department store should wish to take on the management responsibilities in relation to property matters of the store itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-38_para7"></a>In my introductory remarks to our amendment I set out the views that we would prefer. I should say in that context that I would not like to give the noble Lord, Lord Jacobs, the impression that I endorse some of the practices that landlords have engaged in with respect to insurance premiums and other matters such as that: I deplore them. I believe, nevertheless, that where a good landlord offers a competitive price for a service to the tenant, that should be something that is properly applauded.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-38_para8"></a>One aspect which the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lea, does not address is the position of older converted buildings where there is a single entrance and access and all the units--whether commercial or residential--have their individual entrances off a single common access. The Minister thought that out rather well.

<A NAME = "10227-38_para9"></a>If the solution that we offer in Amendment No. 84 is not acceptable, the Minister might like to consider whether it would be sensible to include in the legislation the ability for the landlord to require a lease back of the commercial elements, to mirror the position in relation to the right to enfranchise in mixed use buildings. I shall leave the Minister to reflect on that, and meanwhile beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-39_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I find Schedule 6 quite difficult to understand. In particular, it refers to premises excluded from the right to manage. Paragraph 1(1)(b) states that if you have a garage it should be part of the residential premises. Does that mean that that would be enfranchisable with whatever else one was enfranchising?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   Having prepared a vigorous speech in support of Amendment No. 84A, standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, which he chose not to move, perhaps I may at least console myself by pointing out that Amendment No. 91A has a drafting error. It should refer to line 17 and not line 18.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I made a mistake. I thought it was another amendment and that is why I ducked it. If I had looked at the right amendment I would have moved it. I apologise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-39_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   I should like to raise the issue of the 25 per cent, which has a relevance here, but probably an even greater relevance when we come to the right to enfranchise.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para0"></a>One of the difficulties with the original clause in the previous Bill was that it said "over 10 per cent" and everybody realised that they would need a building of 11 floors--11 storeys--before you could enfranchise. On reconsideration, however, you would in some cases have needed buildings of over 21 floors because, in most cases, certainly in London, retail shops have basements which are usually used for storage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para1"></a>There is also the question about garages, as raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner. It would be helpful, whether it is done for this clause, but certainly for the enfranchisement, to look again at the wording to see whether it is possible to exclude from all calculations garages and such spaces but also basement use; otherwise we may have the situation--I am aware of a number of blocks that I have looked at in London--where there is a row of shops and a full basement below but a total of only six or seven storeys. Those would not come within the 25 per cent, because that area has to be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para2"></a>I would therefore ask the Minister whether he could look at the idea of perhaps excluding basement storage or, alternatively, to say that where there is basement storage the percentage might have to be increased.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I rise to speak to my Amendment No. 91A. Given the arguments that have been put forward as to the benefits of the right-to-manage leaseholds, we do not see why it should not apply to local authority properties, just as for private blocks of flats or those owned by residential social landlords. Local authority leaseholders have been subject to the poor management of their blocks by local authorities and have campaigned hard to gain the benefit of those <P>


<a name="column_CWH1275"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1275</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rights given to others whose situations are identical, except that they are in respect of freeholders and not local authorities. Extending rights under leasehold reform to local authority leaseholders should be seen as the logical extension of the right to buy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-39_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I shall deal with Amendment No. 91, with which Amendment No. 93 is associated. It provides for two further changes. The deletion in the first part of his amendment would cause me significant concern because it deals with the division of the freehold. Some Members of the Committee may remember a scam which was run by some less scrupulous landlords following the 1993 Act. Their trick was to divide the freehold of a single block of flats into a number of parcels, which effectively--and in some cases quite explicitly--made it impossible to enfranchise the block. For that reason, the Housing Act 1996 introduced provisions to deal with that abuse.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para3"></a>Those provisions stated that it was not possible to enfranchise a property which was made up of more than one freehold if it was possible to enfranchise each of the freeholds separately. That in turn made clear the converse: that if it is not possible to enfranchise separate freehold parts of a single block, it is possible to enfranchise them altogether. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 mirrors the provisions of the 1993 Act. They are therefore needed to ensure that the same sharp practice that was used to frustrate enfranchisement cannot be used in the same way to frustrate the right-to-manage. I hope that explains the first point of this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para4"></a>Paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 is there for a good reason. There are a number of circumstances where the right-to-manage will be lost. This will happen mainly where the leaseholders have proved unable to run their affairs properly. Unless we provide otherwise, there would be nothing to prevent those leaseholders immediately embarking on a second or subsequent go at the right-to-manage. It would be wrong to allow for repeat acquisition of a right in this way; an unfettered right to re-acquire right-to-manage would mean that there was no real incentive on the leaseholders to make sure that they were managing the property correctly in the first place.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para5"></a>That said, one failure should not disqualify them forever. Aside from other considerations, there will inevitably be some turnover in the block and a point will come when there will be a new set of leaseholders who wish to exercise the right-to-manage. For that reason, we have chosen that disqualification should last for four years. This is the typical amount of time taken for a substantial turnover of leaseholders within a block to take place. From that perspective, the seven-year period proposed by the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, would be too long.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para6"></a>In a case where turnover is more rapid than that, or there are other good reasons why leaseholders might reasonably be allowed a further opportunity more quickly to exercise the right-to-manage, we still have the fall-back position of a leasehold valuation tribunal <P>


<a name="column_CWH1276"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1276</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>being asked to dispense with the bar. I hope that that explains the inclusion of those provisions and why there should be no deletion of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para7"></a>Before going on to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I shall address the question posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, in relation to the garage. Where the garage is let as part of a flat, its floor area is counted as residential when working out the relative residential and non-residential parts. Likewise, presumably if the garage is part of the commercial premises it counts on the other side. I agree that there are complexities, as the noble Lord, Lord Jacobs, pointed out, and one might look at a way of expressing that more succinctly. However, the totality of the property which was in the residential part should count towards the residential quota and likewise on the other side of the equation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para8"></a>I now come to Amendment No. 91A tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. This is probably where I have to declare a personal interest. Indeed, if the amendment were passed, I should probably have to declare a personal interest in many parts of the Bill because my wife is a leaseholder of a local authority property. However, I would hope that that would not be the only reason that he would not press his amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para9"></a>We want all local authority tenants and leaseholders to influence and take control of the management of their homes. As regards the local authority leaseholders, there is already in existing legislation a range of opportunities to enable them to do this. The Government are working to extend the opportunities for participation through the best value regime and tenant and leaseholder participation compacts, all of which are operating within the local authority sector to improve local housing management and the various options available to tenants and leaseholders in local authority property. We have already broadened the Government's tenant empowerment grants programme to help leaseholders and other tenants to look at the options for involvement, and to support groups which set up tenant management organisations under the existing local authority right-to-manage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para10"></a>Because there is such a wide range, therefore, of existing options open to all local authority tenants, including leaseholders, we do not believe it would be right to overlap those with a right which can be exercised by the leaseholders only within those blocks and estates. That would lead to competition between different groups of tenants and leaseholders in a particular block owned by the local authority, and there would also be a legal conflict between the existing broader rights and this one, which would be a narrower one for leaseholders only. That kind of competition and potential conflict would not be to anyone's benefit and certainly not to the benefit of the better management of local authority property with greater tenant and leaseholder involvement.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para11"></a>The amendments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, also suggest that we should prevent a claim to acquire a right-to-manage being made for a property within two years of an earlier claim having <P>


<a name="column_CWH1277"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1277</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been withdrawn. This relates to my earlier point that we cannot see any justification for doing this. Where the right has been acquired and lost, there will have been some kind of fault or failing and it is only right that, in such circumstances, the leaseholders involved should have to wait. However, the withdrawal of a claim notice would not necessarily mean any fault or failing. The landlord will not have had the management taken away, and will be entitled to receive all the costs incurred in dealing with the abortive attempt.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-39_para12"></a>I hope that that deals with all the amendments in this group, and that they will not be pursued.

<A NAME="10227-39_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   With regard to paragraph 4 of Schedule 4, the Minister spoke about the possibility of conflict. However, there is much potential for conflict now between tenants and leaseholders who often have different interests. He mentioned work that is going on to help tenants in the issue of management. I am not aware of anything like as much energy going into dealing with the position of leaseholders. It is a difficult area and I am obliged to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for drawing our attention to it.

<A NAME = "10227-39_para13"></a>I wonder whether the Minister knows and, if he does not, whether it is possible to tell Members of the Committee at a later stage what kind of numbers we are talking about. The provision for the number of qualifying flats is a criterion which will affect how leaseholders might fall within--indeed, whether they would or not--because so many blocks will contain a large number of tenants rather than leaseholders. It would be helpful if the Minister could give the Committee some idea of the scale.

<A NAME="10227-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 6(1)(b) of Schedule 6. I understand the reasoning behind paragraph 6(1)(b). I do see how the explanation of paragraph 2 fits in with its wording. One must have premises which are divided between two or more freehold owners, one of whom owns a part of the building which is itself self-contained. Amendment No. 69 envisages that there is a self-contained building structurally detached which is divided into two or more self-contained parts which are vertically divided.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-40_para0"></a>The only meaning that I can give to paragraph 2 is that where that set of circumstances arises the right to manage cannot be exercised. That seems to be a long way from the Minister's explanation. I believe that paragraph 2 needs to be looked at again. I understand and support the objective, but I do not see how the paragraph achieves it.

<A NAME="10227-40_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As to local authority leaseholders, the various activities to improve the management of local authority estates include provision for leaseholders as well as tenants. I cannot give a precise answer to the question posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, but of the million or so leasehold flats there are probably 200,000 council leaseholders. I cannot say how many of them would be in blocks or estates where <P>


<a name="column_CWH1278"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1278</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the majority were leaseholders and, therefore, might qualify. The number would be relatively limited. Nevertheless, in those areas the conflict to which the noble Lord rightly refers between those who exercise the right to buy council property in some form or another and those who remain tenants of the council still exists. However, to provide an additional right to leaseholders without a parallel provision to protect the tenants in a situation where the latter are in the minority greatly complicates that conflict.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-40_para1"></a>We seek to pursue this entirely within the local authority management system rather than borrow something which exists in the private sector and transplant it into the local authority sector. The complications which would arise and the additional conflict created underline that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-40_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, referred to paragraph 2 of Schedule 6. That paragraph means that if the freehold is split into two or more self-contained parts the RTM will be exercised for each separately. If the parts are not self-contained one can lump them together and exercise the RTM across all of them. The reason for referring to the scams following the 1993 Act is that one moved from the second to the first and thereby avoided any right to manage. That is the loophole that we were trying to avoid with these provisions. It might be helpful to the noble Lord if I were to spell it out in more detail with cross-references to the texts of the 1993 and 1996 Acts. What is intended might then become clearer to him, and probably to me.

<A NAME = "10227-40_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 92 is another of those very rare Government amendments to which my noble friend Lord Bach referred earlier. Together with Amendments Nos. 99, 101 and 108, it seeks to remove the prohibition in the Bill on exercising the right to manage where the freehold has already been purchased by an RTE company under the requirements of Chapter II of Part II of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-40_para7"></a>The amendments also remove the bar which would prevent RTM continuing where a separate company is used as the RTE company. Leaseholders would therefore be able to have separate RTM and RTE companies for the same premises after the enfranchisement had taken place. I believe that is also the intention of Amendment No. 102, which has been tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. Having looked at the matter again and after discussing it with the noble Lord and others, we thought it sensible to pursue the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-40_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I greatly welcome these amendments. A significant objection to the Bill was that RTM and RTE could not co-exist. That would mean that someone who was a member of an RTM <P>

The co-existence of separate RTM and RTE companies may make administration a little more complicated, but that is not enough to override the injustice to those involved in management who would have been forced out of that involvement under the original proposal.

<P>

<A NAME = "10227-40_para14"></a>When the Bill was first proposed, I feared that the Government would try to find some suitable name in keeping with their modernising culture such as "stakeholder co-operative". It was, therefore, a relief to find that the corporate vehicle for the new right would be simply a right-to-manage company.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-40_para15"></a>Your Lordships will, however, remember the fashion that gripped companies during the 1970s of turning their names into initials. The British Tube and Rubber Company turned into BTR; International Business Machines became IBM; the British Oxygen Company turned into BOC. It was thus, I suppose, inevitable that, by the turn of the century, the Government would decide to call these management companies RTM companies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-40_para16"></a>I submit that one naturally speaks of "an" RTM company rather than "a" RTM company. I therefore commend the various amendments which seek to make this phonetic correction. I beg to move.

This issue relates to whether we take <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the full name of the company or the initials of the company and the pronunciation of the initials. I note that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is disparaging of the tendency during the 1980s to change the names of organisations to their initials. Indeed, I remember myself changing the name of the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Unions into the GMB. I thought that was an improvement--it certainly saved on the word processor, if we had them in those days.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-40_para17"></a>In this case we refer to "a" right-to-manage company, which must be correct. When we reduced it to RTM we are referring in reality only to a right-to- manage company. To attach the "an" to R, which is not even a vowel, is putting the spoken word above the written word. We and the parliamentary draftsman are concerned with the written word. I hope therefore that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will not pursue this rather substantial range of amendments, but I must commend his diligence on spotting the point throughout the text of this Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-40_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, when I was a school governor some years ago we installed an ICI ceiling heating system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-40_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As I tried to explain, if one spells an Imperial Chemical Industries system would be "an".

We are legislating on a new entity which begins with "R".

<A NAME="10227-40_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Does the legislation anywhere provide for a right-to-manage company spelt out in full? The definition in Clause 110 refers to Clause 70, which states:

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="10227-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Kingsland </B>   moved Amendment No. 95:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 30, line 7, leave out ("guarantee") and insert ("shares with at least the minimum paid-up capital, divided into "A" shares and "B" shares").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10227-41_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: There are two aspects of the corporate structure, proposed by the Government for RTM companies, which potentially make the Government's proposals impracticable and which this amendment addresses. There is a further issue as to the kind of regulation-making powers which should be given by the Bill for matters of central importance to the corporate governance of RTM companies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para2"></a>So far as concerns the corporate structure of RTM companies, the Government's proposals are that these companies should be limited by guarantee with residential tenants and the landlord as members. As the Committee is aware, there are three forms of companies which can be formed under the Companies Act. The first is an unlimited company where members have unlimited liability for the debts of the company. The second is the usual form of a company, with liability limited by shares, the feature of which is that each member--that is, each shareholder--has to contribute the nominal value of his or her shares as a capital contribution to the company.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para3"></a>The third form of company is one limited by guarantee. The peculiarity of this form of company is that its members contribute nothing to its capital. Instead, they are under an obligation whereby if the company limited by guarantee becomes insolvent, they have to contribute up to the amount of their guarantee.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para4"></a>The Government propose that RTM companies should all be limited by guarantee. In our view, this would prove wholly unworkable. One of the difficulties of commercial life in this country, which results in many small limited companies being unable to pay their debts, is that limited companies are under-capitalised. These RTM companies which the Government propose are not just under-capitalised but, in effect, zero-capitalised. It is essential that RTM companies have adequate working capital. Only in this way will they be able to carry out the important functions allocated to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para5"></a>It is right to consider the possible consequences of an RTM company having no capital whatsoever. A typical scenario, where tenants seek to have an RTM company appointed, will be a background of dissatisfaction with the landlord. There is likely to be considerable bad feeling between tenants and landlord because repairs have not been done or have been done badly or the landlord has tried to charge too much. There may also be bad feeling between one tenant and another. When things become acrimonious, it may well be that one tenant may refuse to pay service charge demands.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para6"></a>The first thing the RTM company would then have to do would be to sue the defaulting tenant. However, if the RTM company has no capital, there is no money to pay the lawyers to pursue the tenant. Sometimes, though by no means always, a lease will provide for a landlord to recover legal expenses but this is invariably in arrears.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH1282"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1282</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para7"></a>That is not the only kind of case where difficulties arise. Suppose the RTM company collects service charges with no problem and then employs a builder to carry out repair works. One problem with building works is that costs often overrun. An RTM would have collected service charges; but if the costs overrun would not have enough money to pay the builder in full. When this situation arises at present, a landlord is usually willing to pay the extra himself because he knows he can recoup that expenditure from the tenants. However, an RTM company with no capital itself can do this only if it borrows money.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para8"></a>Yet it is unlikely that any financial institution would lend money to an RTM company because that company has nothing to provide by way of collateral. It might be possible to demand further moneys from the tenants by way of supplemental service charges; but this takes time and builders are notoriously unwilling to wait payment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para9"></a>Another problem concerns the landlord's rights. Where the tenants only have a few years remaining on their leases, there is no incentive to carry out repairs. The landlord would have a claim for the damage done to the reversion by the RTM company's failure to carry out repairs. Yet, under the Government's proposals, the landlord's claim against the RTM company would be worthless because the RTM company would be, literally, worthless.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para10"></a>What we propose, therefore, is that RTM companies should have some capital. Naturally, RTM companies will cover developments with quite different characteristics: a block could have as few as two flats in it or upwards of 100 flats. Any single figure for minimum capitalisation would either be far too big for the two flat building or far too small for the 100 flat development. A fair method of overcoming this difficulty seems to be to suggest that an RTM company should be capitalised at about twice the service charge and rent payable.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para11"></a>This would work as follows. Let us suppose that a flat has a service charge of £1,000 a year and a ground rent of £100 a year to pay. The lessee, in order to obtain the right to manage the premises, would have to contribute £2,200 to the RTM company. In a block with 20 tenants, the RTM company would have a capital of £44,000. This proposal gives the RTM company sufficient working assets to meet the problems that I have outlined. At the same time, the amount which a tenant was required to contribute would not be disproportionate. As long as the RTM company prospered, the tenants would be able to pay themselves dividends or set off profit against the service charge payable. So much for the capitalisation of RTM companies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para12"></a>The second point, on corporate governance, concerns the landlord's involvement in the RTM company. Although this point appears in the same amendment as the issue about capitalisation, it is in fact quite independent and separate. Under the Bill as presently drafted, a landlord will be a member of the RTM company. In other words, the landlord will give the guarantee to pay £1 to the RTM company in the event that the RTM company is wound up.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para13"></a>The landlord has an interest in ensuring that the block is maintained properly because the state of repair of the building affects the value of the reversion. It is right, therefore, that the landlord should have some involvement in the property. The problem with the Government's proposed solution is that it does not provide adequately for the landlord's involvement. Under the Bill, the landlord would have the right to appear and vote at a general meeting of the RTM company but the landlord would have only one vote and would therefore be outvoted every time by the tenants. He would have no right to appoint directors and would thus have no practical power to have his interests considered by the RTM company.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para14"></a>The solution, we propose, is to give the landlord a right to appoint two directors. This would give the landlord a minority on the board of directors and we consider that this meets his legitimate claim. If the landlord were allowed to appoint only one director, there might well be practical difficulties if that director, for example, were unavailable for a particular meeting. The tenants would appoint three or more directors so that they would stay in the majority on the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para15"></a>Of course, a landlord would not have to exercise his right. Many landlords whose reversion only fell in a great many years hence might well have no interest in appointing directors and taking on that sometimes onerous responsibility. None the less, we consider that the landlord should have that option if he wishes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para16"></a>The technical way in which we seek to give landlords the right to appoint directors is to divide the shareholding in the RTM company into two types of shares--A shares, to be held by tenants, and B shares, to be held by the landlord. Holders of the B shares have the right to appoint two directors. A further aspect of the A and B share arrangement is to ensure that the tenants are the ones who provide the share capital for the company. The notional value of a B share is £1, so that the landlord does not need to contribute substantial sums to the company.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para17"></a>I now turn to the power to make regulations. As so typically happens nowadays, the Government propose to give themselves extensive Henry VIII powers. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has already given, at Second Reading, the views of the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee, on which he sits with such distinction. Its view is that regulations on central issues should be subject to the affirmative approval of both Houses of Parliament. This must be right in relation to the power to determine the memorandum and articles of association of RTM companies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para18"></a>All the proposals which I have put forward in this amendment are matters which, if the Bill were left in its current form, could be introduced by the Minister by way of regulation. For example, the Minister could determine that the guarantee which a member of an RTM company, limited by guarantee, must give, should be not £1, as is usual with companies limited by guarantee, but several thousand pounds. The Minister could equally determine that landlord members of an RTM company should have a right to appoint directors.

<A NAME = "10227-41_para19"></a>Can anyone doubt that such proposals are precisely the type of issues that should be the subject of public scrutiny and debate? Moreover, who should make the regulation? At present the Bill refers, cryptically, to "the appropriate national authority". The Bill does not, however, condescend to state what this mysterious body might be. I have suggested that it should be the Secretary of State after consultation with the Welsh Assembly. I notice that some Government amendments refer to the Secretary of State and the Lord Chancellor jointly making regulations. There seems to be no objection in principle to that, although it sounds a little cumbersome. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10227-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Our Amendments Nos. 110, 111 and 119 in this group raise an important issue. Should the landlord ipso facto be a member of an RTM? We think not, so we are on the opposite side to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, with the Government somewhere in the middle. We disagree with both points made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland: first, the need for paid up share capital; secondly, the landlord's rights as a member of the company. As to the first issue, we believe that a company limited by guarantee is the appropriate form of company and it is inappropriate in these cases to have paid up share capital. Certainly, the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, would make it more difficult to get people to form an RTM if they had to provide a significant sum of capital up front in addition to the service charges which they have been paying, and will continue to pay, to the RTM.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para20"></a>We also believe that initial paid up capital is no guarantee of continued solvency, because unless it is put into untouchable reserves the effect will be that that fund can be run down. In a year or two it is perfectly possible that the funds will no longer be there. Indeed, it is likely that if the members of an RTM company have had to put money up front they will decide to use it to pay off the first year's service charges rather than pay those service charges in addition to what they have had to pay.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para21"></a>Secondly, we are certainly not prepared to support the proposal by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that there should be B shares which give the landlord a right to vote and to nominate directors. We might be prepared to accept a formula, if one was put forward, whereby the landlord could be a member of the company with a right to attend meetings, but without a vote. However, that is not on the cards at the moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para22"></a>The purpose of an RTM is to transfer the right to manage from the landlord to the lessee. The landlord retains an interest in ensuring the maintenance of the building in order to preserve the value of his reversion, but over the course of time the interests of the RTM company and the landlord may well conflict. The RTM company will owe an obligation to the landlord which can be enforced by the landlord through proceedings in court, whether it is a leasehold valuation tribunal or a county court. To allow the <P>


<a name="column_CWH1285"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1285</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>landlord to be a member of the RTM as well creates a conflict of interest, not only between the RTM as a landlord but within the RTM itself. The landlord, for example, may challenge the decision of the directors. Landlords are likely to be more knowledgeable and have access to better advice. They may be able to paralyse the RTM company through procedural measures. The member of a company can restrain the company from proceeding when it is in technical breach of its own internal rules, for example if decisions have been taken at a meeting at which a quorum is not present. However, a third party cannot do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para23"></a>One cannot prevent a landlord who also holds the lease of a flat, or occupies it in his capacity as a freeholder, being a member of the RTM company. The Government's proposals confuse the relationship between the tenants and the landlord. The RTM company should be the vehicle for the tenants alone. I am aware that this is something about which many tenant organisations feel strongly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para24"></a>Under the existing legislation, it is a matter for the tenants to conduct the management. That relates only to cases where the landlord's right to manage has been forfeited because of his misconduct. However, misconduct is difficult to prove. One of the reasons for the present Bill is to make it possible for discontented tenants to get the right to manage without having to go to court in order to prove misconduct.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-41_para25"></a>In those circumstances, there may be a significant number of cases where the application, the claim for RTM, is instigated by the fact that a landlord is not doing his job properly and is, in one way or another, frustrating the wishes of the tenants. In those cases, it seems to be wholly wrong to allow the landlord to continue as a member of the RTM company; the RTM company and the landlord should remain at arm's length from each other. In those circumstances, I hope that the Government will be prepared to reconsider their position on this significant issue.

<A NAME="10227-42_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   I wish to speak to Amendment No. 110A, which stands in the name of my noble friend Lord Richard. The thrust of the amendment is the same as the thrust of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. Some adjustment is needed on this issue. Looking at the practicalities of the matter, as I said at Second Reading, it would be very strange indeed if, when discussing sensitive matters, a typical RTM company--which is, to use present day language, the residents' association--must have the landlord present in the room at all times.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-42_para0"></a>At Second Reading, I made a suggestion which I hope was noted. It may have been a stupid suggestion, but I have not yet heard why it is stupid and that is why I am about to repeat it. There may be a case for having a basic RTM company meeting--whether under the Companies Act or some other legislation--structured to include a part A and a part B. Part A of the meeting should be confined to the residents; this may or may not include the landlord--it would depend on whether the landlord has bought one of the flats--but that is a separate issue.

<A NAME = "10227-42_para1"></a>It is highly desirable that there is some structured relationship with the landlord. I wonder, quite seriously, whether the Government could think of a route by which a statutory RTM company meeting could be held with the landlord present at a particular stage in the annual cycle; and/or a route by which the RTM company could meet as a residents' association in the normal way every three months or so. It would be for the RTM to invite the landlord to attend on such occasions, but he would have the right to attend once a year, or something like that. To say that there cannot be a properly constituted residents' association meeting--that is, an RTM company meeting--without it being mandatory for the landlord to be there, is going way beyond what is necessary to meet the Government's aims in this matter. I hope that this issue will be given further consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-42_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I support the view of the noble Lord, Lord Lea. There has to be some means by which the landlord can be sure that the building is being maintained adequately, but it would be quite inappropriate for him to ascertain that at the residents' right-to-manage meeting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-42_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The amendments covered in this group raise some substantial issues on the nature of the RTM company and the rights of the landlord in respect of the RTM company.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-42_para2"></a>Amendment No. 95 and the associated amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, propose that the company should be only a company limited by shares. Part of the rationale of the Bill is that it provides for three different companies: the RTM company, the RTE company and the commonhold association. We consider it important that all three should have the same structure so as to allow leaseholders who wish to move through the three types of companies to do so without other complications. Where they have acquired the right to manage, the leaseholders may wish to use the company as a vehicle to purchase the freehold, and this amendment would prevent that happening because there would be different types of company. In particular, it would mean that leaseholders would always have to set up separate companies to acquire the right to manage and then to purchase the freehold.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-42_para3"></a>An even more important objection to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is that it proposes that the RTM company, as a company limited by share, should have a minimum amount of share capital. Indeed, the formula proposed would suggest that it would have to have quite a considerable amount of share capital. I appreciate that the leaseholders' company which takes over the management of the property needs to have access to funds, but to stipulate that it needs to acquire at the beginning a substantial degree of share capital would price a lot of leaseholders out from the start and create far too great a threshold for them to pass through into the right-to-manage company. Many leaseholders would find it hard to pay the <P>


<a name="column_CWH1287"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1287</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>service charge once, and they would find it impossible to have to put forward additional funds as share capital.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-42_para4"></a>The right to manage is intended to be just that, a right. It is intended to put right the imbalance which prevents leaseholders who have a majority of the equity in a property in terms of the leasehold value having a say in the management of that property. We do not want to hedge that around by establishing a threshold whereby they have to build up a fund first. Leaseholders already have to pay the management for the running of the property, and will therefore exercise a right to manage knowing that they themselves, if they take that decision, will have to meet the costs they run up. The additional requirement is therefore an unnecessary and heavy burden.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-42_para5"></a>The noble Lord also put forward an amendment regarding how the Government should set about prescribing the constitution of the company. I appreciate that we need to have some idea of what we are intending in this respect. I sent to noble Lords who had shown an interest in this at the Committee stage of this Bill a draft constitution for both the RTM and the RTE company, and those drafts go wider than we would intend in the regulations, so they cover a number of aspects. We have produced full draft constitutions for the two companies in order to make sure that our minimum requirements sit properly within the wider constitution of those companies and the intention of this Bill. We obviously intend to consult further on those drafts, but it is useful that the Committee has that information at this stage when we are dealing with the substance of the Bill. We will have draft regulations before Parliament when the constitutions of the companies come forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-42_para6"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to the appropriate authorities. They are defined in Clause 155(4) in terms of the Lord Chancellor or the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales. Subsection (1E) of Amendment No. 109 proposes that the Secretary of State should make regulations as they apply to Wales as well as England. There may be good arguments for having the same prescribed requirements, but the National Assembly has clear responsibility for secondary legislation on housing matters and I see no reason why we should change that in this particular instance. The effect of the proposed subsection (1E) would be to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-42_para7"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will not press that the company should either be constituted as a share company or that these other provisions in his detailed amendment should prevail.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-42_para8"></a>In relation to the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and spoken to my the noble Lord, Lord Lea, that we should restrict the right of landlords to be members of the right-to-manage company, I understand the arguments about conflict of interest. I understand the concerns among leaseholders who would balk at the suggestion that the landlord should have the right to participation in the company. I recognise that that is a contentious part of the Bill. <P>


<a name="column_CWH1288"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1288</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, indicated, this is a process to establish a no-fault right to manage. The landlord is not doing what was suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, namely engaging in misbehaviour or failing to meet his obligations. The presumption is that the landlord has done nothing wrong, and it is not intended to be a vehicle to get rid of an exploitative or neglectful landlord. This is a provision to establish leaseholder rights without having to prove negligence on the part of the landlord. Hence, the landlord has forfeited no rights, except insofar as provided for in the Bill.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-42_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Does the noble Lord accept that, although technically it is a no-fault provision, in a high proportion of cases it is likely that dissatisfaction with the way that the landlord is managing the property will be the reason why the tenants seek the right to manage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-42_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   That may be a motivation in some cases but it will not be necessary to establish that in order to trigger the right to manage. There are existing provisions to deal with neglectful, negligent landlords or those who have ignored their legal or contractual obligations. This provision establishes an entirely new right without going through any fault procedure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-42_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   Is the noble Lord able to clarify whether "landlord" in this sense can be either a head lessee or the owner of the property? Are they both covered by "landlord"? Is it either/or?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-42_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   That is so in this case, although there may be points in the Bill where that does not apply. We do not intend to have a procedure that is either anti-landlord or pro-landlord. There is a balance of rights here, and the landlord cannot be entirely cut out of the equation. The landlord has an ongoing interest in the management of the property. At the very least, the landlord has a legitimate reversionary interest; in some cases he will have a greater interest because he may have some flats which are not let on a long lease, or there may be a non-domestic unit within the building.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-42_para9"></a>In deciding the balance, therefore, we have to take account of the fact that the landlord will have an interest in management, and in practice it is sensible that that is de facto equity in the company.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-42_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for giving way. Does that mean that where the present leasehold system continues and the management is the landlord it is proper for the tenants to have the right to be on the management committee or team? If the landlord is allowed to sit with the tenants under the right to manage, is it not equally fair that where there is no right to manage tenants should have a say about the landlord's decisions in managing the block?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In practice, the Bill provides for that to happen in most circumstances. Where leaseholders wish it they can establish a right to manage along with <P>


<a name="column_CWH1289"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1289</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the landlord. It is simply the reverse of what we propose here: they can trigger a right-to-manage company but the landlord will still be part of that structure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-43_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   I am sorry to press the point. It is not always necessary for the tenants to manage their own building. If the tenants are satisfied they are unlikely to want to manage their own building. As has been pointed out, if the tenants have the right to manage the landlord should have the right to sit on that management committee and be party to those arrangements. Surely it follows from that that in cases where the tenants do not decide to take over the right to manage themselves they should equally have a representative sitting with the landlords on the management of their building.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-43_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In a situation where people are not eligible for the right to manage under the Act, the noble Lord may have a logical point. However, where the right to manage applies, the way to establish an engagement in management by the leaseholders is through triggering the right-to-manage proceedings. The Bill does not provide for a fall-back position of the type described by the noble Lord, where people have decided not to go for the right to manage. The landowner does not have that choice. If the right to manage is triggered, the provision that he should remain part of the company that manages is to protect his residual right in that property. In some cases it may be large, in others it may simply be a reversionary impact.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-43_para0"></a>The consultation paper made it clear that the proposals as to how large a landowner's interest in the company would be would be proportionate because circumstances vary. They would be proportionate and not different or unequal. We are therefore not attracted at this stage to A and B shareholders or to members of the company, although such things could be set out in the memorandum and articles of the company. The existing draft does not do that. The structure of statutory meetings as proposed by my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall would also need to be set out. That would, in effect, imply different classes of membership and at the moment we are not convinced that that should be the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-43_para1"></a>I understand the considerable anxieties about this arrangement. Nevertheless, the landlord has rights in such a situation as well as anybody else with an interest in the ongoing management of the property. Our proposals suggest that therefore the landlord should be part of the company on an equivalent basis to that of others with an interest in the management of the property.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   Before my noble friend moves on to the next point, one of the problems in practice is a great difficulty in arranging meetings in a typical block of 20 or 30 flats. If the landlord is in a position to say that the meeting is inquorate, or is not properly constituted unless he has been properly advised and so forth, it seems likely to be difficult to run this organisation. The weight of requirement on running <P>


<a name="column_CWH1290"></a>

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column CWH1290</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>such meetings is beginning to worry me more and more. I ask my noble friend to look at some way of easing this burden so that not in respect of all meetings is the agenda is so arranged that it is necessary to be able to invoke that provision. That could be a way forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-43_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My noble friend makes an interesting point. Were that to be achievable without creating differential classes of member, we might be prepared to look at it in the context of the consultation on the structures of the company. We are anxious that the landlord as a member of the company will preserve some rights in the continuing management of the property. No doubt we shall return to this at later stages in the Bill and I shall say no more now.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-43_para2"></a>Amendment No. 111 suggests that there should be a right for commercial tenants to have long leases. Frankly, this is not an issue to be members of the RTM company. It is not something that came up in the consultation and the commercial tenants have not indicated any great desire so to be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-43_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I did not really deal with that point when I spoke earlier. I concentrated on Amendment No. 110. This is a quite different and fairly minor point. Very few commercial tenants will in fact have long leases. If there are any, there is no reason why they should not be members of the RTM along with residential leaseholders if they are all in a building which is a single RTM unit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-43_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   We are not aware that that is a great problem and for the moment I shall indicate my resistance to that position. It also complicates the position of the landlord as a member of the company if the landlord's relationship is with the commercial tenants. In a sense, he represents that part of the building as well in terms of the company. It would be a little complex in relation to having commercial interests involved in the company as such, although, as I understand the amendment, it would be treating a long-lease commercial tenant as if he were a long-lease residential tenant. I cannot see many circumstances in which that would arise, but it is an interesting proposition.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-43_para3"></a>I resist the attempt to define the RTM company as a share-based company. I also resist the attempt to remove the requirement that a landlord may be a member of the company for the reasons explained. We may well come back, certainly to the latter point, at a later stage of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227-43_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Although I had no support, in terms, I detected a thin mineral seam in the Minister's response on which I may be able to work between now and Report stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227-43_para4"></a>I wish to make one or two detailed observations. I would suggest to the Minister that the noble Lord would not need two companies to move from an RTM to an RTE. It would be quite possible simply to amend the memorandum and articles to change from one type of company to another.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "10227-43_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made the point that the RTM can run down capital; but in my submission that would ignore the director's duty to raise enough money in service charges to cover the outgoings. A director who deliberately runs down an RTM company's capital would, in certain circumstances, be guilty of misfeasance, and potentially liable to disqualification. There is a built-in disincentive to misbehave financially in those conditions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  The Ministry of Defence has for many years conducted research into weapon and armour materials and designs. Research and consultation with allies continues to include the search for potential alternatives to depleted uranium and to identify and characterise their cost effectiveness and environmental impact. Depleted uranium still has a significant margin of operational effectiveness over alternative materials when employed in anti-armour weapon systems. In recent years, a new tungsten round has been developed for the Royal Navy's Phalanx close-in weapons system that offers superior performance (anti-armour qualities are not important for this weapon system). Since 1996, all replacement ammunition for the Phalanx system has been of the tungsten variety.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227w01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   The DU firing test programme in the United Kingdom is subject to regulation under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993, which the Ministry of Defence follows voluntarily, and the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999, which is enforced by the Health and Safety Executive. The Environment Agency in England and and Wales and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency in Scotland also are provided with details of monitoring surveys including annual reports of the firing programme.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227w01_para5"></a>In 1993, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) commissioned the consultants W S Atkins to conduct an independent environmental impact assessment of the firing of DU at the firing ranges at Eskmeals and Kirkcudbright.

<B>27 Feb 2001 : Column WA123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10227w01_para6"></a>The consultants' report concluded that the radiation doses to members of the public, and the associated risks from exposure to DU released into the environment, were extremely low. A copy of the report was placed in the Library of the House in 1995.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227w01_para7"></a>The report also made certain recommendations which were subsequently adopted for the ongoing environmental programme, now overseen by the Defence Radiological Protection Service (part of DERA). This monitoring programme has confirmed that there are only low levels of DU contamination, which are well below anything that could be considered a health hazard either to those who work
at the sites or those living nearby. The results of this monitoring are published annually and local authorities at both sites, together with the Environment Agency and Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, receive copies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227w01_para8"></a>DU is also used by the Royal Navy in their Phalanx close-in weapons system. All live firings are undertaken in dedicated Exercise areas or on the high seas but in the latter case only after issuing a Notice to Airmen and a Notice of Intent. Given that the Naval DU ammunition will be submerged after firings over deep water there is no likelihood of the public coming into direct contact with fired penetrators.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227w01_para9"></a>In addition, the Ministry of Defence Explosive Storage and Transport Committee lays down the policy and standards for the storage and transportation of all conventional military explosives held by the UK MoD and this includes DU munitions. These standards are then enshrined as necessary in Single Service regulations and working practices.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10227w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  To meet the needs of all haemophilia patients in England currently on plasma derived clotting factors, we estimate that 110 million units of recombinant Factor 8 would be needed at an additional cost of 30.7p per unit and 31.5 million units of recombinant Factor 9 at an additional cost of 42p per unit. This gives a total cost of &#163;47 million for recombinant products currently in production. Costs for third generation, totally synthetic products, are likely to be higher.

With regard to a commissioner for all children in England, we will of course carefully consider the Welsh experience to see if there are lessons which we can learn in England that would help to protect and promote the welfare of all children.

We are, though, still considering our position on the detail of the proposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "10227w02_para1"></a>The programme will not have direct regulatory impact and will not require transposition into UK law.

<P>
<A NAME="10227w02_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Bassam of Brighton): </B>  The information requested is not collected centrally in England and Wales. The numbers of police officers recruited,

<P>

<A NAME = "10227w02_para2"></a>The percentage wastage rate for the year 1999 to 2000 was 3.7 per cent, which, compared to other organisations, is very low.

<P>

<A NAME = "10227w02_para6"></a>The direction will authorise the Legal Services Commission to fund legal help and legal representation in these proceedings, subject to applications passing the statutory tests of an applicant's means and the merits of the case.
<P>
