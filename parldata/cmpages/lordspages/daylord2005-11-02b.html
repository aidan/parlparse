<a name="51102-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Foreign and Commonwealth Office: Director for the Americas</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Hooper </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What plans they have to fill the vacant post of Director for the Americas in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, Mr Steve Williams has been appointed Director for the Americas in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hooper: </b>   My Lords, that is very good news because, given the importance of Latin America to the world economy and our historic links with virtually every country in Latin America, distressing rumours were flying around that this post would remain vacant, or that the former incumbent would not be replaced. Will the Minister further reassure us by saying that both he and the DTI will in future attempt to co-ordinate their policies and use this useful geographical post to pursue them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I am always eager to co-ordinate with the DTI and just about anyone else. We will certainly do our very best to ensure that we have all of the impact that was successfully brought to the job by Robert Culshaw, who had a remarkable career. Perhaps I may, on everyone&#039;s behalf, wish him well in his new role as deputy director of the British Antarctic Survey. I should add, for clarification, that there has been some reorganisation across all such posts, which reflects our needs to achieve a more effective and efficient level of management.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Wright of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, it is not perhaps for me to ask about the relative seniority of the replacement for Mr Robert Culshaw, who was a notably senior and experienced Diplomatic Service officer, but the change in arrangements for the Americas, following the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&#039;s Statement last December about the closure of posts, leads us to think that there may be inadequate resources from the Treasury for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, in stark comparison with the resources made available to the Department for International Development. Can the Minister give us an assurance that the Foreign and Commonwealth <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_196"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 196</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Secretary will resist any further attempts by the Treasury to reduce the resources available to the Diplomatic Service?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I also look at DfID and quickly remind myself that envy is a mortal sin. For our part, we will of course try to produce the most effective results with the resources that we have. I have no doubt that the FCO will be making the right arguments to try to ensure that we retain the resources we need. In respect of an important question asked by the noble Lord, in some areas we have seen some significant growth where the priorities of the United Kingdom demanded growth and the resources were moved to the right place. But, of course, everyone would always like more.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Dykes: </b>   My Lords, at a time when many other EU countries are significantly increasing their diplomatic investment and infrastructure in Latin America, would it not have been very short-sighted if the Treasury had not eventually come up with the money? However, the Minister referred to reorganisation and perhaps reducing funding to some extent at the margin. Therefore, despite the new appointment, which is most welcome, the anxiety persists that the resources available will not be adequate when Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, for example, are all becoming significant countries in that part of the world.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I hope that the House will accept that my commitment to ensuring that we do a full and thorough job in Latin America, in a way that reflects the strategic importance of both the whole continent and particular countries in it, remains absolute. I think that most noble Lords will have seen that the Collinson Grant report on the Foreign Office suggested that some realistic delayering and efficiencies could be achieved. That means a bit of reorganisation, and it means moving on and responding in an organic way to the new demands. I hope that the House will see what I have said today in that context.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </b>   My Lords, as ever, the noble Lord is showing his skill in putting his best face on a pretty dismal brief. Does he not acknowledge that it is very strange to compare the dire straits with which he is struggling with the fact that, since 1999, the total number of people employed by DfID has risen from 1,930 to 2,917&#151;an increase of about 50 per cent? Over roughly the same period, the resources available to DfID have risen from &#163;2.081 billion to &#163;3.980 billion&#151;an increase of almost double. Therefore, is it not very disturbing to find that a programme of closures, however much they may be presented as being for the sake of efficiency, is being proceeded with? For example, our post in Madagascar is being closed at a time when major British firms are undertaking fresh investments in that important country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I do not know whether it is putting a brave face on things but I do not think that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_197"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we are in dire straits. The provision of services across the world is of a very high standard. We serve not only commercial interests but the interests of individual citizens who are travelling and so on. I think that most of us will view DfID&#039;s budget, which has, indeed, increased in the way that the noble and learned Lord described, alongside the transformation in the way in which we deal with aid and debt relief policies in trying to deal with AIDS and malaria and in trying to ensure that people whose lives are going backwards to extreme poverty, disease and a lack of education have that trajectory changed, and changed permanently. I hope that we will celebrate that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, I very much echo what the Minister has just said about the importance of the growth in the resource given to DfID, and I am rather surprised at the note on that aspect struck by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon. Perhaps I may ask a question about transparency and the amount of information that will be given about the reorganisation. Some of us deal with officials in the Foreign Office from time to time. The noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, and I went to see Robert Culshaw before I led a delegation to Bolivia, and it was important that he was able to lend some weight as Director for the Americas in giving us an overview from Venezuela to Argentina and on the oil and gas situation. Now that the sectoral dimension is being brought forward, can the Minister put something on the website or place a note in the Library explaining how it will work?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I am happy to ensure that everyone knows who is doing what so that they can get in touch with the appropriate people. I genuinely have confidence in the arrangements that we have made. We have appointed someone with considerable experience of both Latin America and the Caribbean Department. There will be a strong team of experts in London and, of course, in our posts in the area, many of which are headed at a very senior level. We would have not accepted&#151;I certainly would not have done so&#151;a set of arrangements in which we could not be confident. That would have been a foolish step on my part. I am confident in this arrangement, and I hope that that confidence at least conveys itself to the House.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="51102-01_time0"></a><h5>2.44 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Hoyle </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What steps they are taking to persuade the owners of sports stadia to make these non-smoking areas.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, we have introduced the Health Bill, which provides powers to ban smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces and, potentially, in other places, such as sports stadia, as set <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_198"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 198</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

out in the Explanatory Notes in paragraph 41. We are encouraging people to be aware of the health risks of second-hand smoke through our high-profile television campaigns aimed at protecting children and adults. Local tobacco alliances and primary care trusts have worked with local sports stadia to support their going smoke-free.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="51102-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Hoyle: </b>   My Lords, first, I must declare an interest as the chairman of Warrington Wolves Rugby League Club. Following an overwhelming demand from our spectators, we are implementing a ban on smoking in the new Halliwell Jones Stadium from season 2006. Despite what my noble friend says, there is an urgency about this. Will he try to persuade the Government to see whether, on health and safety grounds, other owners of sports stadia can do what Warrington is doing today and it is to be hoped the rest of the country will do tomorrow?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51102-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that we all recognise that Warrington is the epicentre of innovation and progress. I certainly congratulate my noble friend on the forward-looking policies adopted by Warrington Rugby League Club. I am not competent to comment on its performance on the field.
</p>

<a name="51102-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>There are many examples&#151;I shall give a few from another sport&#151;where stadia are taking forward similar policies. Examples are Derby County Football Club, Middlesbrough Football Club and the City of Manchester Stadium, where I believe that Manchester City play. They are all taking forward that policy and the local tobacco alliances and primary care trusts that I mentioned are working with sports stadia up and down the country to pursue the same policy as has been followed in Warrington.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, will the Government confirm that there is a basic absurdity about having to watch any sport where athletes are running around through a fog of tobacco smoke? Will they further confirm that encouragement to ensure that that does not happen will be given so that the policy is introduced as soon as possible?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, that is why we introduced a Bill with a provision in Clause 4 that enables regulations to be made to do the very things for which the noble Lord asks.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </b>   My Lords, if we have to look to Warrington to give leadership, can the Minister tell us when the Government will show some leadership to ensure that we do not have to worry about sports stadia or any other public place allowing secondary smoking?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the Government are delivering our election manifesto through the Bill, which will make enclosed workplaces covering 99 per cent of the workforce completely smoke-free. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_199"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 199</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Currently, only 51 per cent of people report that their workplaces are completely smoke-free. I think that that is leadership in action.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Winston: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend have any scientific evidence that smoking in an open-air stadium is in the least bit harmful to health?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we know that smoking in the context for which the Bill will provide, where there are groups of people close together, may mean that some people are exposed to second-hand smoke. The evidence of the deleterious effect of second-hand smoke on health is very clear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister explain to me why the same Government have concluded that one set of rules should apply to Northern Ireland and another to England?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   Devolution in action, my Lords.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   My Lords, as someone from a devolved Administration that wants to go much more smoke-free than does England under the Bill, we should congratulate the Government on the Tobacco Advertising Act, which is working well, but why on earth should 1 per cent of the workforce remain exposed to passive smoking if 99 per cent of the workforce will be protected? Are not the policies adopted by Warrington and the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff good examples and good ways to influence the population to allow that last 1 per cent of the population to be protected?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, in launching this Bill we have already said that we will be consulting on how best to protect workers in the remaining 1 per cent of workplaces which are exempt from the proposals. We are clear about that, and will carry out that consultation.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What arrangements they are making for diplomatic representation at Nuku&#039;alofa, Tonga, after 2006.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the British High Commission in Nuku&#039;alofa, Tonga, officially closes on 20 March 2006.

</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that moderately satisfactory answer. I chose Tonga out of several islands I might have chosen which are going to suffer this fate, because I was once a one-man delegation to Tonga, on the Government&#039;s behalf, for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I hope that your Lordships are aware that it is the one country in the world where the upper House of Nobles has much more power than the lower House of Commons.
</p>

<a name="51102-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Is there going to be any further closing down of representation to small countries which, on the whole, I would have thought deserve our representation just as much as the larger ones which cause considerably more trouble?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, for his description of the superior House there. I am surprised they did not enlist his services to aid in their deliberations on a permanent basis.
</p>

<a name="51102-02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>We have no plans for further restructuring. However, it would be foolish to imagine that other priorities might not arise at some future stage for any government, and that there might not be further rearrangements of our resources. In some parts of the world we are opening and expanding&#151;for example, Baghdad, Basra, Kabul and Pyongyang. They are costly exercises, but they reflect real growth.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, notwithstanding what the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, has said about the position of the hereditary nobles in Tonga, is he aware that proposals have now been approved by the parliament, at the instigation of Prince Tu&#039;ipelehake, one of the leading proponents of reform, to establish a constitutional reform committee among whose general items will be the replacement of the heredity peers by an elected element? Will the noble Lord therefore consider favourably any representations that may be received from Tonga, either directly or through the Commonwealth Secretariat, for constitutional advice or financial assistance in the process of the constitutional reform on which it is about to embark?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I had not been aware of that proposed pattern of constitutional reform. I promise to study it with the greatest of care to see whether investment on our part is liable to produce a return that will satisfy this House.

<a name="51102-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Wright of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, if I can impose on the patience of the House in asking a second question today, is it still Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#039;s policy to pursue a global foreign policy?

Fiji. Does the Minister recall that I asked a question about the closure of the various representations in Vanuatu and the other Pacific islands? The answer was that the same person, who clearly now is going to do the work for Tonga from Fiji, was doing it for those various other islands. People were very unhappy about those changes. Have they already been implemented and, if so, how are they working? Are people satisfied now?

<a name="51102-02_spnew19"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I believe&#151;I shall check this&#151;that they have been implemented. When we look at the level of representation that we have in those islands, it is against a background of there being, as far as I can detect, no requirements from anyone for any consular assistance in any circumstances in recent years. The workload is probably realistic across most of the tasks that we would expect consuls, honorary consuls and others to perform.

<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="51102-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My Lords, admissions policies for academies are, and will continue to be, agreed by the Secretary of State and must accord with the code of practice to ensure all-ability local admissions.

</p>

<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="51102-03_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. Am I right in thinking that the White Paper contains no power to enforce trust schools to introduce banded or fair admissions of any sort, that it is purely a matter of encouraging them to do so, and that there is no intention to introduce legislation to enforce it? If that is the case, does &quot;fair admissions&quot; mean anything at all?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="51102-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is under a misapprehension. The schools adjudicator will have exactly the same power in respect of trust schools: an absolute power to enforce admissions arrangements where they are held to contravene the code of practice, and complaints are made to the adjudicator.

<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="51102-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Baker of Dorking: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the Government on reintroducing grant-maintained schools, which I introduced in 1988 and they abolished in 1997. Does the Minister recall that they were so <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="51102-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, we have not reintroduced grant-maintained schools in any form. In particular, we have not reintroduced the unfair funding that grant-maintained schools received, in respect of other schools; nor have we reintroduced the 11-plus and the selective admissions that they were allowed to introduce. We have no intention of doing so.

There is a requirement for schools to admit pupils with special educational needs who are specifically named in the statement in respect of that individual school. We are also giving further priority to looked-after children in admissions to schools, and we will lay before the House regulations that will require schools to make that their first item for admission in their admissions arrangements.

How will the Government ensure that there are levers to make sure that no poor child or child with special needs or a disability will be left behind if, as they hope, all schools turn into trust schools?
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="51102-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Adonis: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness should not necessarily take at face value everything that she reads in the <i>Guardian</i>. Last September, the 14 academies that led to that report recruited 1,100 pupils eligible for free school meals compared to 980 for their predecessor schools. That is an increase of 12 per cent, so the evidence is that they are increasing not decreasing their outreach to poorer students.

<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="51102-03_spnew22"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. It is a Bill for and about patients, and about delivering a better response to patients who have been harmed by their NHS hospital care. It puts patients at the heart of the process. It is about supporting the NHS to learn from mistakes, and making the NHS a safer place to deliver patient care.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>In 2001, the then Secretary of State, Alan Milburn, asked the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, to look at reform of the clinical negligence system. This <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_205"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 205</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

was because the current system was perceived to be complex, unfair and slow. It was seen as costly in legal fees, in diverting clinical staff from delivering care and in its negative effect on NHS staff morale and public confidence in the NHS. It leads to patient dissatisfaction with the lack of explanations, apologies or reassurances that action has been taken to prevent the same incident happening to another patient.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Perhaps as worrying is the fact that the present arrangements encourage defensiveness and secrecy in the NHS that stand in the way of learning and improvement. In June 2003, Sir Liam published a series of recommendations for reform in his report <i>Making Amends</i>. The Bill gives effect to his recommendation that we should introduce an NHS redress scheme to provide investigations when things go wrong; remedial treatment, rehabilitation and care, where needed; explanations and apologies; and financial compensation in certain circumstances.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>We want to take a radical approach to responding to patients who are unhappy with the healthcare that they have received. The Bill sets out the framework for an NHS redress scheme. The scheme will provide a mechanism for settling claims in tort arising out of hospital treatment, brought by patients, their estate or their dependants. It will provide a mechanism for the swift resolution of low monetary value claims without the need to go to court, covering claims in respect of personal injury or loss arising out of a breach of a duty of care and in consequence of any act or omission of a healthcare professional. Only liabilities in current tort law will be covered by the scheme; the intention is not to create new rights but to improve access to justice for those with rights that exist under current law.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The scheme is not an end in itself; rather, it is a means to an end. It supports a better response to those patients who have suffered clinical negligence under the care of the NHS. It delivers what patients tell us they want when something goes wrong with their care&#151;an explanation, an apology and things being put right, including coverage of financial losses and financial compensation where appropriate. They want to know that the NHS will work to ensure that what has happened to them does not happen to others. It establishes mechanisms for there to be a response in a positive and open way to patients and their relatives when mistakes are made in the delivery of healthcare. The scheme is intended to facilitate the resolution of cases in a swift manner, ensuring that redress is provided to the patient as quickly as possible.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The scheme will apply only to cases arising out of hospital care provided or commissioned as part of the health service in England, wherever that hospital care might be provided, regardless of the type of provider or contracting arrangements. The majority of cases of clinical negligence occur in secondary care; it is therefore appropriate for the scheme initially to be implemented in hospital care. I recognise that there are concerns about restricting the freedoms of NHS foundation trusts by requiring them to be members of the scheme, as we intend. However, we believe that patient interest is best served through a level playing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_206"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 206</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

field, with all providers participating in the scheme. Those principles have the support of the director of the Foundation Trust Network.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>We do not intend it to be possible for a patient to be compensated twice. Any case that is or already has been the subject of court action&#151;successful or otherwise&#151;will be excluded from the scheme. When a patient accepts an offer under the scheme, he or she will waive the right to bring civil proceedings for the liability to which the settlement relates. If legal action commences during the consideration of a case under the scheme, the case will be excluded from the scheme.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>We envisage that the scheme will be administered locally. To drive culture change, scheme members will need to take ownership both of how they respond when something goes wrong and of the solutions to any shortfalls. Learning from mistakes at a local level will be promoted by a new requirement for scheme members to appoint an appropriate member of staff&#151;for example, a director&#151;with responsibility for overseeing the scheme and learning from mistakes.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>It is intended that the NHS Litigation Authority will monitor the scheme to ensure consistency, support scheme members and provide advice and assistance where needed. We envisage that the NHSLA will determine liability and quantum for cases falling within the scheme and make payments under it. Scheme members will contribute to the costs of running the scheme through financial contributions that will be adjusted to reflect the quality of the risk management processes that each organisation has in place.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>The Bill sets out requirements for organisations to identify cases covered by the scheme while investigating or reviewing cases and to take appropriate action. We intend that all scheme members will be required to trigger the scheme and provide investigations and explanations. In appropriate cases, apologies will be offered and, after consultation with the NHSLA, an offer of financial settlement. Patients or appropriate representatives will also be able to apply to the scheme directly.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Financial compensation will be broadly equivalent to the level of compensation that would be provided in a successful claim before a court and the offer of redress may include, where appropriate, remedial care. The scheme will cover cases up to a maximum financial limit which will be set out in secondary legislation. It is currently intended that this limit be set initially at &#163;20,000 .
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>I note the concerns of the charity Action against Medical Accidents, that to guarantee patient empowerment there needs to be access to specialist independent advice. I should like to reassure your Lordships that to protect patients&#039; interests it is intended that the applicant will be given the opportunity to have the offer of redress independently evaluated by a solicitor without charge to them. It is also intended that where awards are made to vulnerable people such as children or those lacking capacity, they will be subject to approval by the appropriate court to ensure that accepting the offer is in the patient&#039;s best interests.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51102-03_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>If an offer is rejected, the patient will retain the right to pursue the matter through the courts. The scheme is not intended to affect the legal rights of the patient.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>The NHS redress scheme is not a cost-saving measure. In the short-term it may increase costs, as access to justice is improved. Costs may be around &#163;48 million in the first year. However, this is a small increase when set in the context of the huge investment the NHS has seen over the past five years with NHS funding rising to around &#163;70 billion in 2004&#150;05. The scheme ensures that money is spent on compensating patients with a genuine claim of clinical negligence rather than on the disproportionate legal costs that come with litigated cases. The scheme&#039;s costs will be offset by a saving of around &#163;7.6 million on claimant lawyer costs in the first year alone.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Where patients are unhappy with the administration of the scheme, the Bill provides for handling complaints about maladministration of the scheme. The Bill broadens the remit of the Health Service Commissioner for England to allow her to investigate complaints relating to maladministration of the scheme and to report on her findings.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Much of the technical detail of the scheme and how it will be run will be set out in secondary legislation. A delegated powers memorandum and further note providing additional detail on the rationale behind the structure of the powers has been submitted to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. A statement of policy will also be published before Committee stage which will set out the detail of how the scheme will work in practice.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>It is intended that there will be a single scheme set out in a document that will be scheduled to regulations. The regulations and detail of the scheme will be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. Specifically, the regulations establishing the scheme will be subject to affirmative resolution procedure. Prior to this, the regulations will be published in draft and a full consultation will be carried out with stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Scotland and Northern Ireland do not currently intend to adopt the NHS redress scheme. The Bill includes a framework power allowing the National Assembly for Wales to make regulations establishing arrangements as to how redress will be provided in Wales.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Extensive consultation has taken place with stakeholders to develop the policy behind the NHS redress scheme. Its principles have received broad support from a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives from the medical and legal professions, NHS organisations and patient groups. Many organisations acknowledge the need for change and support these reforms as a way to deliver a better response to patients.
</p>

<a name="51102-03_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The British Medical Association and Royal College of Nursing have indicated their support for the broad principles behind the Bill. The Patients Association is,

I commend the Bill to the House.

<a name="51102-04_time0"></a><h5>3.16 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="51102-04_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, on behalf of all my noble friends on these Benches, I should like to thank the Minister for having introduced the Bill with his customary clarity. It is a Bill which, let me be the first to say, springs from a diagnosis with which very few would take issue. There is surely no doubt that the system which we have at present for dealing with clinical negligence claims against the NHS is fraught with shortcomings. It is slow and it is expensive. Typically, a claim, from the moment it is initiated, takes a very long time, often several years, to reach an outcome. Not infrequently the legal and administrative costs of settling a claim exceed the money actually paid to the claimant. In the last financial year, legal costs accounted for over a quarter of all the money paid out in clinical negligence cases.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>On top of that, the system is widely viewed as being unfair. The main unfairness is that it is only the 10 per cent of the population who are eligible for legal aid, and the very rich, who have access to justice. For many people there is no justice at all because the cost and complexity of making a negligence claim deters them from ever beginning, even though the grievance may be perfectly legitimate. What the Minister did not say, but which he could certainly have added, is that a high proportion of the cases that are taken forward are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_209"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 209</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

artificially fuelled by the legal aid system, which creates perverse incentives to lawyers to take on cases regardless of merit and then to drag them out. For claimants on legal aid there is no downside because even if they lose, costs cannot be awarded against them. By exactly the same token, the NHS is in a no-win situation. Even if it successfully defends a case, the costs of doing so are irrecoverable if the claimant is legally aided; and that often means that it is cheaper to settle a case out of court than to contest it, even though the claim may lack any obvious merit.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>The need to reform the system is plain and the Government are to be congratulated on having the political will to try to get to grips with it. I particularly agree with the Minister that more often than not what the aggrieved patient wants is an explanation and an apology for what went wrong. But all too often he gets neither. For the majority of people, making a complaint is not about the money, it is about getting those responsible for a clinical error to acknowledge what went wrong and gaining some reassurance that lessons have been learnt and that the same thing will not happen to someone else. It seems to me that if any sort of new and improved claims system is to be counted a success it is these things, above all, which it must deliver.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The Minister helpfully charted the journey the Government have made since the commitment in their 2001 manifesto to reform the system. The fact that this journey has been, to put it kindly, something of a rocky road is one which, perhaps understandably, he glossed over. The great cry in the CMO&#039;s document <i>Making Amends</i> was the need, as he saw it, to move away from a strictly tort-based system. Now, though, as we read Clause 1 of the Bill, what do we see staring us in the face? There is the phrase &quot;qualifying liability in tort&quot;, defining what will constitute a valid claim under the proposed scheme. It looked for a long time as if the Government were going to place a good deal of emphasis on conditional fee agreements as a way of ensuring that only claims with a real chance of success would be taken forward, and spurious claims weeded out. Then, after a great deal of cogitation, we heard from Mr. Lammy last March that the Government&#039;s proposals would not, after all, include the idea of conditional fee agreements.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>There were, I believe, 19 recommendations in <i>Making Amends</i>. This Bill embodies the response only to the first of those. Of the rest, the major recommendation&#151;for a no-fault scheme for birth injuries sustained by babies&#151;has, we understand, been dropped and the remaining 17 quietly shelved. So, high marks to the Government for good intentions; but we need to recognise that the Bill before us is not quite the groundbreaker that many of us once believed it would be.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The objective of the Bill is certainly laudable. It is to create a scheme for speedy, efficient and appropriate redress for patients of the NHS who have suffered harm arising from negligence during the course of their treatment. It is designed to deal with claims of harm at the less serious end of the spectrum, and we know that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_210"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 210</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

these currently comprise about 70 per cent of the claims made each year. The great advantage is that the scheme is intended to be an alternative to the complex and expensive process of civil litigation. I do not think anyone would dispute that these are all good and worthy aims.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>What we need to decide, however, is whether the Bill achieves those aims successfully. It is a skeleton Bill. Much of the detail will be the subject of regulations. It is a great pity that we have no draft of the regulations before us that we can consider; but, because we do not, it is a fair bet to say that we shall need to table a goodly number of probing amendments in Committee to try to put some flesh on the bones. There are, however, things that we can surely say in advance of that stage. We hear that it is the Government&#039;s intention to give the NHS Litigation Authority the responsibility of running the new scheme. That means that an organisation which&#151;with no disrespect to the excellent people in it&#151;is very much in-house in relation to the NHS is being asked to take charge of the claims process from start to finish. It is being asked to determine the facts underlying the claim; to decide whether there has been an error; to assess the seriousness of any such error and give an explanation of what happened; to determine whether the error constitutes a qualifying liability in tort; and, if it finds that it does, to put a value on the compensation to be offered to the patient. The NHS, in other words, is being required to find fault against itself as judge and jury of its own performance.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>I believe that that inherent conflict of interest represents a serious flaw in the scheme. What we essentially have here is a trade-off. The trade-off is between speed, simplicity and ease of handling and natural justice. I do not believe that that trade-off will command confidence. However diligently the NHSLA does its job, the patient will never be able to have certainty that bias is absent or that he has not, ultimately, been short-changed. The one feature of civil litigation which is surely positive is that it is an independent process. The same really cannot be said of the scheme before us. It will lack credibility.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Then there is the cost. We see on page 13 of the regulatory impact assessment that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;The Redress Scheme may increase spending on compensation payments because it will improve access to justice and thus bring new claims into the system . . . The vast majority of opportunistic claims will be easily rejected&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I do not know what basis the Government can possibly have for making that last statement. In clinical negligence litigation the success rates are modest. Vast sums of public money can be spent before cases are abandoned. All the experience to date shows that spurious claims are not easily rejected. Indeed, in litigation, nuisance claims are often compensated where the claimant has no risk because it is more expensive to contest the claim than it is to settle. Exactly the same thing is likely to happen here. The redress scheme provides a free ticket for a compensation claim, with no disincentive whatever for claims that are opportunistic.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_211"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 211</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51102-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>We are assured by the Government that the scheme will represent a departure from the adversarial tort-based culture of the courts. Frankly, I do not see that. Where you say to a claimant that he is entitled to free legal assistance to help pursue his claim with the NHS, it is hard to see how this will not replicate the adversarial culture with which we are already so familiar and which <i>Making Amends </i>explicitly sought to avoid.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>But what is particularly unfortunate, in my view, is that the proposals before us focus so strongly on monetary compensation. The essence of <i>Making Amends </i>was that redress should first and foremost be about fact-finding, explanation and apology. In the majority of cases, as we know from patient surveys, that is all that the patient wants. By putting the emphasis on compensation, the proposals in the Bill force us to move those ideas away from centre stage. I think that that is an error.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>If I had to summarise what I felt about the Bill I would say that it was a wasted opportunity. With a little more finesse, the Government could have created a scheme that did all the things that everyone wants and which the scheme before us patently does not. In Committee, I shall be setting out an alternative model. The essence of that model is to separate the process of fact-finding from the process of determining liability.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The process of fact-finding should be carried out by a body independent of the NHS&#151;perhaps the Healthcare Commission&#151;at the end of which would emerge an explanation, recommendations on lessons learnt and, where appropriate, an apology. The fact-finding exercise may or may not give rise to a qualifying liability in tort. Determining whether it does or does not should not be a function of the NHS. Whether a patient wishes to pursue the compensation route, having received an apology and explanation, will be up to him. But investigating fault and determining damages should be entirely outside the scope of the redress scheme. Those things can be pursued by negotiation, specialist mediation or by a fixed costs arrangement.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I freely concede that a two-stage model such as this is likely to lengthen the time before compensation is obtained. But it is less likely to short-change the claimant; it is less likely to compensate unworthy claims; it will be independent; and, above all, it will meet patient expectations.
</p>

<a name="51102-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>The scene is set for some interesting debates in Committee, to which I look forward. I could have wished to conclude my remarks by congratulating the Government on a piece of work well done. That I cannot do so is a matter of sincere regret, as I do not doubt that the Minister&#039;s heart is in the right place. But if noble Lords are minded to agree with me that these proposals are not well thought through, there may be a chance of persuading the Minister that improvements to the Bill can usefully be made. I very much hope so.

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="51102-05_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Neuberger: </b>   My Lords, in many ways we must all welcome the NHS Redress Bill. I need to declare a few interests: I was formerly&#151;a long time ago&#151;chair of the Patients Association; I have been a member of the GMC and I have chaired an NHS trust, so I have dealt with some of those issues over a long period of time. Indeed, going back nearly 20 years, AvMA&#151;Action against Medical Accidents, or the Association for Victims of Medical Accidents, as it was then called&#151;had as its chief executive Arnold Simanowitz, who was even then proposing a similar scheme so that we could get away from the adversarial and litigious system that he saw growing in our country.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>More recently we have seen concern about the huge cost of litigation, although that is mostly down to lawyers&#039; costs, and some very large settlements, because the actual number of cases has begun to go down. Most of us would also have broadly welcomed the Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson&#039;s excellent consultation document, <i>Making Amends</i>, which came out some two years ago. No one thinks that the present system is satisfactory and all of us have concerns that it militates against a culture of openness and frankness between clinicians and patients and between staff more generally and patients. At present it leads to a less than frank approach; and given the understandable reluctance to admit mistakes it is all the more difficult to learn from them.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>If we add to that a growing risk aversion more generally in our society and a failure to accept that things will go wrong in human interactions and that modern medicine is complex and can be dangerous, we seem to have a recipe for a difficult atmosphere between patients and clinicians when things go wrong. Indeed, in my experience staff often prefer to hide mistakes because they are frightened of being blamed within their own organisations for mistakes that have taken place&#151;as they will in normal human interactions.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Add to that the natural if not wholly acceptable tendency of organisations to be loyal to themselves and staff within them to each other and one can see how it might be difficult for an ordinary patient or patient&#039;s relative to obtain a proper explanation or apology when things go wrong&#151;as they do. As an NHS trust chairman in the 1990s I certainly saw that at first hand: people seemed to find great difficulty in admitting mistakes, apologising and explaining what had happened. So all credit to the Government for trying to take on the issue and for realising that the present position is far from satisfactory.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>That having been said, however, like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, we on these Benches feel that the Bill begs more questions than it answers. The Minister will no doubt already have had presented to him by other means many of the issues that I and other noble Lords will raise with him today. He may indeed answer that all our concerns will be dealt with in the detail of regulations, but I have to say that we will not be satisfied with that, any more than the noble Earl, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_213"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 213</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Howe, is satisfied that we have not at least seen draft regulations to examine at this stage. We too think that there may be a large number of probing amendments in Committee.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>However, we are seriously concerned with three separate aspects of the Bill as well as wishing to raise other questions. Like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, we were surprised to see that we have before us a wholly talk-based system, given all the publicity there has been about the system and all the agonising there has been about a talk-based system in the past. The first of our three major concerns, as AvMA and others have rightly pointed out, is that it is essential that any investigation into an adverse incident is truly independent. That is because of the organisational point to which I referred earlier, where those within an organisation, however well intentioned, tend to back their colleagues unless the circumstances are extreme. That is backed up by this week&#039;s news from the Healthcare Commission that around one third of NHS complaints are referred back to the organisations concerned. We are not good at dealing with that issue.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>It is also essential that the system has an independent element if the new system is to be one from which doctors, nurses and other health professionals can learn. Only by being held up to an independent view can people truly learn, where there is no question of bias.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Yet the Bill does not say anything about that. AvMA suggests that the responsibility for investigating and deciding upon cases under the redress scheme should rest with an independent body rather than the NHS litigation authority, which is part of the NHS system and which will administer the scheme. That has some attraction, as has its suggestion that the Healthcare Commission would be an obvious candidate, given its role at the independent stage of NHS complaints. The Healthcare Commission also has a much more general monitoring role, so that it could ensure that lessons were properly learnt and absorbed from the incidents dealt with by the redress scheme.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Even if the Government do not want to go that far, they should certainly be emulating in the Bill what has already happened in the current Welsh speedy resolution scheme and in the Resolve pilot scheme which took place a couple of years ago, a fast-track resolution scheme for smaller claims. In both schemes, the judgment as to whether compensation should be awarded was made by an independent medical expert, agreed by the NHS and the claimant together. Independence is the first main question. We would also like to know why AvMA and other members of the Clinical Disputes Forum were told that the redress scheme would be run like the Resolve and Welsh schemes, and why that now appears not to be the case.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>Secondly, there is the major question of the dropping of the duty of candour, which was such a key feature of Sir Liam Donaldson&#039;s consultation paper. Yet at least half the thinking behind the desire to go for a redress scheme such as this was to encourage openness and candour, as the National Patient Safety <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_214"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 214</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Agency&#039;s policy seems to suggest, as the GMC&#039;s good medical practice guidelines insist, and it has also been warmly welcomed by the Healthcare Commission. Yet that duty of candour is not mentioned in the Bill, despite it being key to the National Patient Safety Agency&#039;s thinking and despite the fact that this whole approach rests upon a desire to move away from an adversarial and less than frank approach to an open one of trust between clinician and patient where redress, when things have gone wrong, can be swift and simple.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>Thirdly&#151;and this point has already been raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the Minister himself&#151;the scheme appears to be limited to hospital care, despite signals from the Minister that it may eventually be extended. Yet it is clear that the vast bulk of care is provided by primary care. At present, if patients are damaged by negligence in primary care, they have to sue their GPs individually, as contractors to the NHS. That makes no sense, given the changing shape of primary care, the vast increase in care in the community, especially for chronic conditions, and it makes it difficult for both patients and GPs. Patients often know and like their GP, yet they may have been damaged by care received within the primary care system. Meanwhile, GPs are paying large premiums for indemnity cover. It is hardly satisfactory.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>There are many more questions, perhaps not of such great importance, that the Minister may be able to clarify in his response. First, what happens when it is not a case of individual negligence but system failure, arguably organisational negligence? Will the scheme cover that, and will the NHS be able to learn from it thereby? Secondly, are there any rights of appeal against a decision of the litigation authority, or does a dissatisfied claimant simply have to go to the courts, as now? If that is the case, will it not militate against openness in the system? Thirdly, who will monitor the scheme to see that it is carried out fairly&#151;if the NHS is investigating itself&#151;and that the NHS learns from these errors and that systems are put in place to help NHS organisations learn openly from things that go wrong? Fourthly, how will claimants be advised? Will they be able to get access to independent specialist representation and paid for beyond the solicitor who will be paid for at the time that an offer is made by the litigation authority? If not, how will this be seen as truly involving the patient as an equal, especially if the investigation is being carried out by the organisation which has been challenged and complained against?
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Few patients have the expertise to ask the right questions at the right time. Nor would they necessarily understand how judgments are made, such as by the Bolam test where it is not the &quot;highest expert skill&quot; that is the test but the standard of the &quot;ordinary skilled man&quot;. One has to be technically reasonably competent to get one&#039;s head around that.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Fifthly, although the Government have not gone for a no-fault compensation scheme&#151;a system favoured by these Benches&#151;the Scottish experience with the Macfarlane trust for HIV-infected people from blood products is one where people receiving payments waived their right to litigate and the Government were <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_215"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 215</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

excluded from liability. Did the Government consider the advantages in terms of openness and less defensive practice&#151;a contrast with the US-style practice about which the Chief Medical Officer is so worried of a no-fault system? And, if they did, and rejected it, how does the Minister think that this system will truly promote openness, when practitioners will still be concerned about being found negligent?
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>How does this present Bill relate to the Swedish no-fault system, where successful claims are those that compensate for injuries unexpected by the patient and unforeseeable or impossible for physicians to avoid&#151;in other words, the practitioner is not found to be at fault, but injuries worthy of compensation are compensated? There appears to be no similar provision in this Bill. Such a provision would give clinicians some comfort&#151;they would not be seen to be negligent.
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Lastly, this Bill seeks to deal with relatively small claims and the Secretary of State can cap the amounts, yet the real cost of settlements comes from severely damaged babies at birth and from legal costs. To what extent will capped settlements mean that prospective claimants will choose not to use the scheme, but instead go to claims farmers operating on contingency fees? Even if legal aid will not be freely available&#151;clearly it will not be&#151;will a low cap not make it likely that lawyers will operate on a contingency fee basis and claimants go through the courts as at present so that the hoped-for reduction in litigation will not necessarily take place, health professionals&#039; fears of litigation will not be reduced and the whole aim of openness and learning from mistakes will simply not be realised because the cap may be set too low?
</p>

<a name="51102-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>In conclusion, in principle we are delighted to see this legislation. But at present there are too many unanswered questions&#151;I have given the Minister a few&#151;and too many concerns of principle for people on these Benches to give it their unqualified support. Like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, we also think that this is a wasted opportunity.

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="51102-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Murphy: </b>   My Lords, what is proposed in this welcome enabling Bill has the potential to do much more than at first appears. I support this Bill: it will help to improve the culture of responsiveness to complaints in the NHS. I declare a personal interest as chair of a strategic health authority in London which last year spent over &#163;26 million on compensation claims and legal costs through the NHS Litigation Authority schemes for trusts on our patch.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>The NHS Litigation Authority has done a terrific job in my view over the past years to bring down the number of new claims. After all, that is what we hoped it would do. However, the amount awarded by the courts for the more serious cases has gone up and so have legal costs&#151;quite dramatically in some cases and possibly unjustifiably. As Ron Bradshaw, the chair of the authority has remarked, the authority and insurers, when paying legal fees, are like those paying a taxi fare for a driver who is choosing the route, at a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_216"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 216</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

rate that he would like to be paid, for a passenger&#151;the claimant&#151;who is totally disinterested in the fare because they will not be paying. Compensation culture has become legal vulture culture in many instances.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Thirty-eight per cent of claims are abandoned, 43 per cent are settled out of court, usually in favour of the patient, just less than 2 per cent are settled in court in favour of the patient and an even tinier percentage, 0.5 per cent, are settled in court in favour of the NHS&#151;the last two instances at quite phenomenal cost. Even going as speedily as they can, the whole process takes on average about one year and four months.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>This Bill is designed to address that multitude of smaller claims that at present not only often take just as long for the patient to get settled but are at the heart of a disastrously defensive NHS culture of avoiding blame at all costs. I do not know whether noble Lords have ever been in receipt of an NHS response to a complaint letter, but I have seen dozens. I usually see them five or six months down the line when it is too late to say, &quot;Oh dear&quot;. They make me cringe with embarrassment. They are couched in something like:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;We are sorry you felt the need to complain about your perception that&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>followed by a list of what they think is wrong. They are awful. There is rarely a straight apology that something has gone wrong and never an honest, open explanation. Given that, importantly, there is no opportunity for the clinical service to learn from mistakes to prevent the thing happening again. An escalation of patient and family resentment follows; positions become entrenched; and while legal action is being pursued there is every likelihood that the patient&#039;s physical and psychological recovery from the mistake will be delayed. We see that time and again. People could get back to work but their return to work is delayed because they are waiting for some compensation claim to be settled.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>The National Patient Safety Agency has put in a first-rate confidential incident reporting system to encourage clinicians to be honest about accidents, mistakes and near misses. It aims to end the blame culture, but unless we change the redress culture, too, its efforts will not yield fruit.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>If I have a concern, it is about the duty of co-operation between the NHS Litigation Authority, the NPSA and the Healthcare Commission outlined in Clause 13. At present the NPSA operates with the full confidence of the clinical professions and the NHS management because they know that they can turn to it in absolute confidence. I should like reassurance that there will be no obligatory information sharing, even of anonymised data, if in the NPSA&#039;s judgment that would be detrimental to its role in allowing clinicians to speak in confidence.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The scheme is attractive because it provides a more proactive approach to clinical negligence with the onus no longer on the patient to initiate a claim but a duty on the service to initiate an intervention. All scheme members&#151;trusts&#151;will be required to review adverse incidents themselves, where appropriate. I want reassurance on how the schemes will be triggered. I am <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_217"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 217</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

still rather puzzled as to how it will work in practice. If the patient does not initiate a request, who does? If the patient cannot, who can? If the clinical service initiates it, there is scope for major under-reporting. I need to know more about the practicalities of the scheme.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I am disappointed, as I had hoped that the Bill would ensure speedy assistance to children with severe neurological birth injuries so that parents could receive a support package as well as financial help as quickly as possible. That would be a major advance and simplification of the legal wrangles that have to be negotiated, and would give practical help at a time of enormous distress. I wonder what happened to that&#151;so many of us were hoping that it would be alongside the low compensation qualifying amount scheme.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Overall the aim of the scheme is to ensure that NHS money goes directly to benefit patients and to provide appropriate, speedy redress, with less spent on legal costs. Of the &#163;26 million spent in my area, two-thirds was paid out, properly, in damages to patients, and about one-third&#151;nearly &#163;9 million&#151;was spent on legal fees. That would fund an awful lot of hip replacements or cancer treatments.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Everyone to whom I have spoken in the NHS supports the Bill. Although I am sure that there are many ways in which it could be improved to ensure that patients feel that it is a fair and ready way for them to get the compensation they need, I wish it a speedy passage and hope that it will be very much supported by Members of this House.

<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="51102-06_time0"></a><h5>3.49 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="51102-06_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Morgan of Drefelin: </b>   My Lords, I welcome the introduction of the Bill. As one of the signatories of the NHS Plan back in 2000, as was the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, when the initiative was first trailed, I am pleased that we are debating the principles of the new scheme today.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I shall focus for a moment on why the Bill represents an important step forward for patients, and I make a plea that when we get into the detail we do not lose sight of that. Yes, in recent years it has been widely recognised that the NHS does not respond well when things go wrong. It has been a fight for patient organisations to get to that place. In some cases when things have gone wrong, the NHS has literally added insult to injury. We have heard already that health professionals can close ranks and become defensive; but we know also that, depending on the severity of the wrong, most patients would consider an apology and the knowledge that their experience would not be replicated for others to be an appropriate response, and that only a minority of patients who experience the most serious mistakes or wrongs would like to go on to seek financial compensation.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>We know that when things go seriously wrong, patients have little alternative but to go through the legal system; and while most cases are settled out of court, pursuing those cases can be extremely time-consuming and a distressing experience for all. As we have heard, the NHS Litigation Authority reports that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_218"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 218</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

60 to 70 per cent of claims do not proceed past initial contact with a solicitor or disclosure of medical records, and 95 per cent are settled out of court. Let us think about the people behind those numbers. I am particularly concerned that more should be done to eradicate the unnecessary suffering of patients, their families and the carers whom that statistic represents. We need to do much more to change the situation&#151;and noble Lords should remember that some cases can take up to 10 years to settle.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>There is a very strong case to be made for a redress scheme that would provide a real alternative to litigation and which is fair and accessible. Very importantly, the scheme should promote a speedy resolution and improved patient experience when things go wrong. It is essential that such a scheme should create a new openness about mistakes and should contribute to a cultural change, away from defensiveness and secrecy&#151;a cultural change that is vital if lessons are to be learned from mistakes, as we have already heard today. Most importantly, it is essential that the scheme is made as accessible and effective as possible for patients; otherwise, those who can will continue to litigate, with all the costs and distress associated with that.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Key to that success is the principle of access for patients to free, independent, specialist medico-legal advice. The scheme proposes that that should be made available to all, and I think that is an extremely important principle; but I am concerned about the timing of the advice, and that access to independent advice might be too limited if it remained at the end of the process&#151;at the &quot;take it or leave it&quot; stage. I am particularly concerned that while any offer may be made without prejudice for the scheme member trust, participation in the scheme for patients who may at a later stage go on to require legal aid, should they decide to decline an offer, could prejudice their legal aid, because their refusal of an offer might be viewed as unreasonable by the Legal Services Commission. Therefore, that particular group of patients will need to have their interests protected by accessing legal advice before entering into the scheme. I do not believe that that is intended as the scheme stands.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>That brings me on to the question of who initiates the scheme. I, too, believe that the tenor of the scheme is proactive, and that is a very important principle. I am pleased to see that trusts as well as patients would be expected to initiate the scheme when they see a wrong done, but that must be with patient consent because it is only patients who can assess whether participation in the redress scheme is in their interests.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I am very pleased that remedial care will represent an integral part of the scheme. All too often the current adversarial system conspires against the establishment of appropriate care packages. When accidents happen, lines of communication between healthcare professionals and patients can break down and it can lead to needs going unmet.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>As has already been said, the Bill does not contain much detail about the operation of the scheme, and much will be defined in secondary legislation. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_219"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 219</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Therefore, I am particularly keen that we should explore with the Minister more of the thinking behind the scheme to obtain an indication of what we might expect to see in regulations.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>For example, I am interested to know more about the &#163;20,000 ceiling. Will that act as a deterrent to the success of the scheme? I do not know. What will be the process of review in three years&#039; time? What will be the success criteria? How will the assessment of the appropriateness of the expansion of the scheme into primary care be made, especially as we are now seeing government policy move ever faster towards the provision of hospital services out of the hospital setting? I am interested to hear more about whether there will be convoluted or complex definitions of a hospital service, regardless of its location. I am pleased that the scheme aims to be speedy and to place time limits on the various stages, but I am concerned that in the interests of speed we should not place a restrictive time limitation on a patient&#039;s right to apply to the scheme. What is envisaged?
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>There is a strong desire for the redress scheme to be handled locally and to dovetail with the new complaints procedure, which is vital. But only this week, as we have already heard, there have been reports from the Healthcare Commission that trusts are not dealing with complaints as well as they could be. There may be some real issues about how practical it will be for trusts to manage the scheme effectively at a local level. We have heard that trusts will be seen by many to be acting as judge and jury for their own mistakes, so we need to be confident that the new redress scheme can operate in a fair way for patients.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>There has been much consultation in preparing the scheme, and I understand that the legal profession and the healthcare professionals&#039; organisations are supportive&#151;as are patients&#039; organisations. There are concerns and I am sure that we will be able to debate them further. For example, I was particularly interested to hear concerns from mental health charities about the Bolam test, where there is quite a wide spectrum of usual practice and there will be some interesting matters to discuss in relation to it. There are also real concerns about the independence of the scheme.
</p>

<a name="51102-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I understand that the Minister will not have time today to respond to all my points, so I look forward to having his responses in due course. The aim of the new scheme is to increase access to justice and I fully support that. I very much hope that we will be able to make the most of the opportunity that the scheme represents. I hope that it will lend dignity where often there is none, and help to create a National Health Service that is open and learning, a service where there is rarely a need for patients to litigate, because the caring principles of our patient-centred NHS will prevail, even when things go wrong.

<a name="51102-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Colwyn: </b>   My Lords, we are already half way through the list of speakers. Every point that could possibly have been made has been made&#151;certainly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_220"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 220</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

every point that I intended to make has been made. I feel rather sorry for the speakers who will follow me. However, I hope that your Lordships will allow me to emphasise one or two of the points that have been made.
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Any legislation that will allow patients who have suffered adverse incidents in NHS hospitals to avoid the complex legal process and to claim redress in the form of an apology, explanation, further remedial treatment and some financial compensation has to be welcomed. The current system is complex and unfair and suffers from all the defects that have been explained by the Minister and listed in the Explanatory Notes and the various briefings that we have all received. That has been very adequately covered by previous speakers.
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The medical and dental professions are supportive of the initiative and I know that the defence organisations&#151;I declare an interest as a member of the Medical Protection Society, a past member of the council of the Medical Protection Society and a past chairman of Dental Protection&#151;are in favour of a move away from purely financial compensation towards a more comprehensive package of redress. I know that the other dental Peer, my noble friend Lady Gardner, is also in favour of the Bill. She says that she feels that many hospital disputes will be resolved far more easily under this proposed process.
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The absence of the threat of litigation will, it is hoped, create a culture of openness within the NHS in which lessons can be learnt and risks reduced. It should ensure much greater frankness in explaining the nature and cause of any mishap and move us away from the present culture, which prevents health professionals being open about mistakes and learning from them.
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to assure the House that this legislation will go some way towards discouraging the increasing national culture of the need to complain&#151;the need to find someone to blame; of no win, no fee litigation. A constant awareness of this threat cannot benefit the NHS, where 99.99 per cent of healthcare workers carry out their duties to the best of their ability and maintain high standards of care. Is it the Government&#039;s intention to continue to measure standard of care by the Bolam test, as already mentioned by the noble Baronesses, Lady Neuberger and Lady Morgan?
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>However, some aspects of the Bill require clarification&#151;in particular, the need to avoid doctors and healthcare professionals being unfairly criticised. The provision of accessible and appropriate redress for patients in a timely and efficient manner, avoiding the need to resort to lengthy litigation cases, would benefit both patients and professionals. It is important that the redress scheme balances quick resolution with thorough investigation. There must be a careful examination of the facts. Any investigation that fails to consider all aspects of the care provided could lead to doctors and other healthcare professionals being unfairly criticised. That might lead to further investigations and disciplinary hearings that could <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_221"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 221</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

undermine the morale of healthcare professionals, negating one of the core objectives of the redress scheme.
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>The Bill contains little detail, and much of the substance will be determined by secondary legislation. While I understand the need for flexibility to accommodate experience in changing NHS practice, the operational details must be subject to more rigorous scrutiny. Important practical matters, such as raising the qualifying monetary cap for claims, the composition of adjudication panels, the instruction and role of medical experts, the nature of guidance on assessing and awarding compensation, and the appeals process, have not been outlined and will be determined by secondary legislation and by the prerogative of the Secretary of State. I welcome the Bill and look forward to dealing with the detail in due course.

<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="51102-07_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Tonge: </b>   My Lords, I hope that I have some fresh points to make. When I was still working in the National Health Service in 1991, I remember Rosie Barnes, the SDP Member of Parliament in the other place, introducing a Bill for no-fault compensation for health service patients. I have watched with interest as successive governments have tried to deal with this problem. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, when I was a Member of Parliament I certainly saw those awful letters in response to complaints from my constituents. I noted that the majority of patients give up in despair under the current complaints system and simply cannot face the legal fees or the stress of litigation. Therefore, of course I welcome the Government&#039;s attempts to address the problem, but I have many areas of concern.
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>First, I was discomforted to read the press release put out by the Minister, Jane Kennedy, in which she talked about medical negligence. In fact, she referred only to &quot;negligence&quot;. I felt that that was rather an affront to the majority of hard-working health professionals in the National Health Service. Mistakes are not necessarily negligence; they can be made by doctors as well as accountants and other professionals, and she should have acknowledged that. Those mistakes, or errors of judgment, can be due to fatigue, often brought on by the need to achieve the targets of which the Government are so fond.
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>The Minister smiles, but as one who has tried to achieve those targets and lives with someone who is still trying to achieve them, I know what I am talking about. A safe health professional is a relaxed and unhurried one who can spend all the time that is needed to explain to patients their diagnosis and treatment, not someone who is conscious of a bulging waiting room outside and a manager looming with a clipboard around the corner.
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>A culture of defensiveness has developed in the health service, so that health professionals are unable to be totally frank with patients when an error occurs, as other noble Lords have said, because of the fear of litigation. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, what <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_222"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 222</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

patients really want is an explanation and an apology. It is as simple as that. I therefore hope that the Bill will help to dispel that culture. But it is difficult to know because in nearly every clause there is a reference to the Secretary of State making regulations. As many noble Lords have said, the secondary legislation is all-important but we do not know what it is. Perhaps the Minister will tell us when the regulations are due to be published, so that we can adequately address them in Committee. Otherwise, how can we effectively amend the Bill?
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I have several questions as a consequence. We are told that trusts will be registered under the scheme, which will be overseen by the National Health Service Litigation Authority and operated by current complaints departments in hospitals. There is no independence there for the patient. How will the complaints department have the expertise to perform what is a medico-legal process? Will it mean more non-clinical staff&#151;managers, in common parlance&#151;to investigate clinical mistakes and a larger NHSLA to oversee them? Reports made by complaints managers at present are often lacking in clinical veracity and have to be rewritten by overburdened clinical staff, which wastes more of their time and puts more pressure on them. We need to know how this will operate in practice.
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Will the low level of claims suggested&#151;under &#163;20,000&#151;encourage people to try to get a few thousand pounds out of the NHS? It will cost them nothing to try. What estimate has been made of the cost of that and will it really reduce the current litigation bill, which is generally made up of much larger claims? I understand that there is a duty on scheme members to appoint a person to learn from mistakes. I find it quite extraordinary that that had to be in the Bill. Do people in the NHS not already learn from mistakes? Are we suggesting that more staff should be employed to consider mistakes and how they have been made? When I was in the NHS, I spent many hours considering mistakes and drawing up and revising protocols that drove doctors and nurses nearly mad. Surely we are doing this already and, if not, why not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="51102-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, has the noble Baroness looked at the National Patient Safety Agency website on mistakes made within the NHS?
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="51102-07_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Tonge: </b>   My Lords, I regret to say that I have not, but I am appalled if we in the health service are not learning from mistakes already. That suggests that we may need to employ a whole army of people to consider those mistakes and ensure that they are not made again. Has that cost being taken into account? If patients can receive redress in the form of care, who will perform the assessment? Will it be those who currently assess people for social care, care at home, care in the community, or whatever? Who will do that and will that be an extra cost to the scheme?
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>The area which concerns me most, however, is the definition of &quot;negligence&quot;, &quot;a mistake&quot; and &quot;an error of judgment&quot;. Who will draw up the list for the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_223"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 223</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Secretary of State of things that can be considered mistakes? What if a whole chain of command is involved, as it often is in the heath service? Whose fault is it if a doctor gives a patient a drug to which they are allergic because the patient&#039;s notes have been lost? Who lost the notes?
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I wonder whether the dreaded MRSA infection will be on the list of mistakes and negligence in the NHS. As far as I am concerned, MRSA is certainly due to negligence by the health service. Whether it is by over-prescribing by medical professionals, lack of personal hygiene among nursing staff or incompetence of managers and the cleaning contracts which they have set up, I know that Florence Nightingale must be turning in her grave when she looks at the current state of the health service. MRSA infection is a disgrace. Will every patient who contracts it be able to claim under this scheme?
</p>

<a name="51102-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>There are many more questions I would like to ask, but I await the Minister&#039;s response and, of course, the crucially important secondary legislation.

<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="51102-08_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   My Lords, the Bill is an important step forward in ensuring that there is reasonable compensation for patients when things go wrong. That is the point upon which I want to focus&#151;when things go wrong.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The Minister, in his helpful opening remarks, spoke of the framework powers for Wales. I hope that consideration will be given in negotiations on the way in which the Bill will work in practice in England towards negotiating and discussing with Wales as well. There are patients who cross the border. Cross-boundary flows are the one area where patients may get caught, because clinical conditions are very complex. It may be difficult to know to which side of the England/Wales border the error might be ascribed and blame apportioned.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Access to the scheme depends on a tort that would be otherwise actionable. How do we know when things go wrong, however? Currently, in courts, the Bolam test is applied, to ask whether the treatment was in acceptance and accordance with current medical practice. The answer this question, there is a peer review process&#151;from someone with the scientific knowledge and clinical expertise to give truly informed comment&#151;and a judgment made. We are all aware of some notable failings of the expert witness system. They have been principally in relation to criminal conviction, however. It is a real problem for any system of review to know just what should, or should not, have been done.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Medicine is now so specialised that without reference to expert opinion consistency of outcome will not be achieved. Indeed, the very foundation on which a judgment is made will be flawed. It will not be possible to have expertise in all the details of all the conditions. Some of them will be absolutely crucial to the case in hand, details which will prove or disprove negligent care. Without sound information, my concern is that inappropriate and inconsistent <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_224"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 224</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

payments will be made. While the intention behind the Bill is excellent, it may stack up some problems if we abandon the Bolam test.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The Bill anticipates that the Bolam test will remain. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me on that. It would be better if the Bill explicitly stated that the redress scheme will apply only where it can be shown that the care is inadequate as judged by accepted medical practice. We are not talking about the lowest common denominator, but about a standard which is accepted as good.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>A different robust standard to the Bolam principle has not been found. Unless we use the Bolam principle, what will happen? There is, of course, a risk that people will claim that things should have been done based on anecdote, Internet website findings or whatever, but that those interventions which they claim should have happened would not be recognised as evidence-based clinical practice.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>The difficulty is that, when we look at evidence-based practice, most of the time we are looking not only at the situation of one disease and one intervention but also at complex human beings with multiple pathology and different psychological states, all of which can affect outcome. How all those interact will determine ultimately whether care was reasonable and up to standard or whether it was substandard.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a> Under the NHS redress scheme, there will be inherent criticism of the NHS professionals involved in the award of a payment. If a payment is made because the care is unsatisfactory, the system must have failed&#151;it may have been the team, a managerial system or a central policy rather than an individual.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a> The claimant lobby may be trying to find another standard. It is in their interest to get the maximum compensation out of the system, and it is right that they should keep up the pressure for it. But if the compensation threshold is lower, it will be set by a person&#039;s unrealistic expectations to fly in the face of what the NHS can offer rather than realistic expectations that take into account co-morbidity and other incidental factors.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a> Co-morbidity is the most important factor in determining poor outcomes, yet sadly it is rarely recognised by the claimant. Clinicians cannot be held responsible for the presence of co-morbidity before patients presented themselves but they must take it into account. They cannot always predict its detrimental effect. The difficulty in clinical practice is that doing nothing can have adverse consequences and may be more dangerous than attempting to do something, so each clinical decision is taken on a balance of risks. When those risks are finely balanced, the inexact science of human disease behaviour can tip the scales so easily the wrong way. Why do some people resist infection yet others succumb? The NHS cannot be held responsible for the inherent genetic factors in the spectrum of the &quot;normal population&quot;. Such variation in the &quot;normal&quot; is not clinical negligence.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_225"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 225</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51102-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a> What happens if the service is unusually stretched for some reason? In a major incident, for example, the staff and the system have to deal with that incident so other patients may have their care delivered differently. If the incident goes on for some time, some patients may get less effective care than they otherwise would&#151;for example, a delay in diagnosis&#151;but that must be taken into consideration in a fair scheme of redress.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a> What of the difficult presentation of a serious situation? Let us take subarachnoid haemorrhage as an example. A patient has a warning bleed and attends accident and emergency with a terrible headache. A full history is taken, the patient is properly examined and is told that she has migraine because the story fits that diagnosis. She appears to recover and goes home but then has a catastrophic bleed. Not every patient who presents with a headache can have a head scan. If the patient had not recovered in the interim or the symptoms had not fitted a migraine picture, further investigation would have been indicated and warranted. Using the &quot;stands to reason&quot; argument, it would be suggested that the diagnosis should have been earlier and that there may not have been sufficient information to warrant such a rapid diagnosis of migraine. But when a typical situation is presented, you can see how that diagnosis was assumed and made.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a> The redress scheme may award compensation, but without a robust determination of the facts the scheme risks handing out money as sympathy rather than true redress. It is usually not the NHS&#039;s fault that someone is ill or that someone&#039;s disease does not respond to treatment, and the nature of disease and its course is not an exact science&#151;as a clinician, I dearly wish it were. But it is appropriate that, using the Bolam test, every patient should have the best possible treatment within the resources available.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The NHS system cannot investigate every possibility of every case, but I hope the system will operate reasonably against an accepted standard, and I urge the Minister to use the Bolam principle.

<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="51102-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Parekh: </b>   My Lords, I welcome this long overdue NHS Redress Bill, whose advantages seem to me to be obvious. It reduces legal costs. In 2004&#150;05, the cost of clinical negligence was about &#163;503 million, of which &#163;150 million&#151;just under a third&#151;went on legal costs. The smaller the claim, the larger was the percentage of legal costs.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The Bill should also avoid complicated complaints procedures, which on average take about a year and a half, and sometimes go on as long as 10 years. It should also provide access to medical justice. Last year, I am told, around 800,000 adverse events relating to the NHS occurred. Only a tiny percentage&#151;about 6,000 complaints&#151;involved litigation and compensation payments. This seems to suggest that a large number of people who have suffered from <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_226"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 226</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

medical negligence are deterred from complaining for all kinds of reasons, and the proposed scheme should be able to remove some of these.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>I like the idea that the scheme is proactive, and the onus is no longer on the patient. This should be of particular help to the poor and ethnic minorities, who are not familiar with the system of complaint and litigation that may be available to them and therefore do not take advantage of it.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>While I endorse the Bill for these and other reasons, I have a few questions. Some are straightforward and simple, others a little more complex. First, I am not clear whether the figure of &#163;20,000 includes remedial treatment. If it does, compensation is likely to be very little and the limit needs to be raised. Secondly, how do we ensure that the remedial treatment is adequate and suitably monitored? Thirdly, this Bill would cover only a small percentage of claims. I am told that last year only 5 per cent of the claims involved amounts of around &#163;20,000. It would therefore be useful to monitor the scheme to see how it works, and, if it works well, to find ways of extending it to claims involving larger amounts of money.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I have difficulty with the NHS Litigation Authority. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, raised this question, and I want to repeat the point they made. I am not entirely sure that the authority can be both prosecutor and judge. It is bound to be seen as in some sense loaded in favour of the medical staff against whom the complaint is made. We must find some way of ensuring that the two functions are separated. I am also not entirely sure how the authority is to be composed. Will it include a larger percentage of lay members than it has so far? What about ethnic minorities?
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>My next point concerns the mechanism to ensure that information on mistakes made in one hospital or NHS trust is circulated widely so that it does not remain confined merely to the hospital concerned. Perhaps we should have a national register of mistakes that have been made. It is also important to have a record of good practices, and to see that they are duly disseminated throughout the country, and not limited to the organisation concerned.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>This final point interests me enormously. The Bill is said, rightly, to have been designed not merely to deal with small complaints, but also to change the NHS culture, and to alter profoundly patients&#039; experience of the NHS. Although the Bill makes some progress in that direction, I do not think it goes as far as it could and should. A MORI poll conducted on behalf of the Department of Health revealed statistics that are a great compliment to our country, and to the culture that prevails. Only 11 per cent of complainants were interested in financial compensation. In the case of severe damage, the percentage was no higher than 15 per cent. The figures for the United States are between 75 per cent and 85 per cent. Some 34 per cent of complainants were happy simply with an apology; 23 per cent wanted an inquiry, to avoid a reputation of negligence for themselves or others; and 16 per cent wanted support in coping with the consequences of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_227"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 227</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

negligence. That would seem to suggest that nearly 73 per cent of our people have no interest in financial compensation.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>That raises some interesting questions. How do we ensure that that culture is sustained and does not become a culture of complaint or compensation? It is not just a question of identifying pockets of negligence and dealing with them; we need a profound transformation of the way in which the NHS functions. We need more openness. Often, consultants take decisions that are not explained to the patients. Like many Members of your Lordships&#039; House, I could cite cases in which a consultant has diagnosed a patient in a particular way and the patient has screamed, &quot;Look, your diagnosis doesn&#039;t make sense. It does not fit in with my history&quot; and still the diagnosis is registered on the patient&#039;s file.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>We also need greater humility on the part of doctors. It is important to bear in mind that some cases of negligence can be attributed directly to the medical staff, while others are the complex product of the system in which decisions are taken. It is important, therefore, not merely to think in terms of identifying pockets of negligence among particular members of staff but to consider the system as a whole and ensure that there are clear rules about how medical decisions are taken.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>There have been cases&#151;I could have cited several&#151;in which, for example, surgery was ordered by a junior doctor, even though the patient was not satisfied that the case warranted surgery, the patient has asked to see a senior registrar, and the registrar has reversed the decision of the junior doctor. If the patient had not had the confidence in himself and the courage to ask for a second opinion, he would have been subjected to the surgery and would either have wasted a large number of days suffering the consequences of it or would have made a request for compensation. The example suggests that, often, in some of the hospitals with which I am familiar, the rules on who is entitled to order surgery and whether&#151;especially in the case of patients who are admitted at the end of the day&#151;surgery can be ordered by a junior doctor or must be approved by a senior consultant are not clear.
</p>

<a name="51102-08_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>For those and other reasons, although I welcome the Bill wholeheartedly, I suggest that there are some loose ends that need to be tightened up. I hope that, in Committee, the Minister will explain why those changes should not be made or will be gracious enough to incorporate them into the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I should declare my interest as president of the Medical Protection Society, a not-for-profit discretionary mutual organisation that provides our members, who represent over half the medical and dental professions in the UK, with indemnity, legal advice and assistance for matters arising from their practice. We run education and risk management programmes that aim to improve patient safety and reduce the number of reasons for complaint.

That is all the more reason why it would be helpful if the Minister could give us some reassurance now on one or two important points.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>First, it is clear that the Bill is not a no-fault compensation Bill. Like other noble Lords&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, mentioned the issue&#151;I like the idea of that type of compensation for a patient who has suffered some adverse effect from treatment, where no one is at fault, and no blame is to be attached. The Bill is for patients who have suffered because someone has been at fault. That means that someone else has to make a judgment about whether a complaint by a patient that they have been treated wrongly is justified. Was the treatment or management wrong or below acceptable standards? Should he receive compensation and an apology? I always taught my medical students and junior staff that expressing regret when a patient had suffered&#151;expressing concern and empathy&#151;whether or not one was at fault should be part of the culture. Not admitting liability where one is not liable is, of course, important; but one can surely express regret that a patient has suffered.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Is it correct that the NHSLA will be responsible for the making of that judgment? Will it set up a system for that assessment? That is a concern. Other noble Lords have talked about the problem of the NHS appearing to make the judgment. I have concerns that the litigation authority may make speedy judgments because that is cheaper than doing it in any other way. It is vital that we balance a quick resolution, which is highly desirable, with a fair and thorough investigation of the complaint. At present when a medical professional has to defend himself in court against a complaint he leans heavily on the Bolam principle which compares what the doctor in question did with what would be regarded as normal medical practice. Did what the doctor did fit within the range of acceptable practice as judged by a respected body of experts in that field? If the practice was normal then it cannot be held that there was an error and fault cannot be claimed, even though a patient may have suffered; and that is the problem. That is why I like the idea of no-fault compensation.

</p>

<a name="51102-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>However, we are not talking about that today. The point about this is that when an assessment about a complaint is being made, if it is to be fair it is essential that expert advice about the specific area of medical practice is available to the judging panel. The Bolam principle should be applied; hence the need for the input of an informed body of professional opinion. The Bill provides no detail on how judgments will be reached on complaints, who will make the assessments and to what advice they will have access. Can my noble friend give us any clues on that and any reassurance on the thoroughness with which complaints will be assessed? I hope that he will not say that this will have to wait and all will be revealed in due course. However, if he does, perhaps he will at least tell us that there will be an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult all stakeholders on the future regulations and on such important matters as the composition of adjudication panels, the role of medical experts, the nature of guidance on assessing and awarding compensation and the appeals process.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I am also concerned that primary care is omitted from the Bill. Is there any chance that primary care may be included at some point? The Bill is welcome but, as always, a little more detail about how it may work would be extremely helpful.

<a name="51102-09_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   My Lords, I take to heart the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, about points already raised. Eight out of the nine speakers before me have asked similar questions. Perhaps I may add more to the list.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>We learn a lot about a Bill from its advent. The advent of this Bill has been both strange and telling. After First Reading it received a fair amount of sympathetic publicity&#151;and then nothing. There was a deafening silence. Until late last week Members of the House were receiving a flood of detailed briefing, all of which has been supportive of the principle behind the Bill and all containing a range of questions from people with a degree of expertise in this field. That has set the tone of our debate. Our bizarre job over the next few weeks will be to encourage the Minister to demystify an awful lot of what is in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>I am reminded of an occasion when, in discussion with one of the Minister&#039;s predecessors on one of those annual Bills that takes our NHS system to bits and puts it back together again, I wondered aloud whether the day would come when this House would consider a Bill that stated: &quot;There is the Secretary of State and here is a list of regulatory powers&quot;. To my horror, I think that that day has come. I am going to put a lot of questions to the Minister because I think it is right to do so. It will save Members of the House valuable time at later stages.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Anyone who has tried to make sense of the Bill will have found two documents extremely helpful. The first is <i>Making Amends</i>, in which the Chief Medical Officer sets out the need for a scheme and the key elements necessary to make it effective. To the extent that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_230"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 230</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Bill before us reflects the recommendations made in <i>Making Amends</i>, it has our support. However, as a number of speakers have already pointed out, key recommendations in <i>Making Amends</i> are not included in this legislation. In our view, the principal omission is the duty of candour on health professionals. That is a deficiency and one that we will seek to address during the passage of a Bill which in principle we very much welcome and support.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The other helpful document is the Full Regulatory Impact Assessment which sets out in detail the background to and rationale for the Bill, and the need for primary legislation. Two very telling statements are made in the assessment, which point out clearly the need for this legislation and its main failings. The first states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;New primary powers will enable the delivery of the reforms listed above, and will enable the Scheme Authority to seek financial contributions from participating local bodies and enable these funds to be used to fund the Redress Scheme. Duties could not be imposed on FTs [foundation trusts] and independent providers other than by primary legislation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>That is a very revealing statement and, were it not for the need to legislate for the inclusion of foundation trusts, I wonder whether the whole matter would have been dealt with by regulation. However, it is a mark of the deficiency of the legislation before us that even informed commentators have had to ask at every stage whether this Bill does indeed include foundation trusts, because they are not mentioned in Clause 1(2) or (3)
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>That statement also goes to an issue which so far no one has mentioned. The NHS Redress Bill is just one of a series of measures such as PALs, ICAS and NHS complaints systems designed to enable people to make complaints against the health service. Each of those elements has an intrinsic value, but together they do not add up to a coherent and consistent means by which citizens can hold the NHS fully to account. Now is not the time to rerun arguments about the abolition of the CHCs, but it is fair to say that the range of measures which the Government have put in their place does not offer an effective and efficient system of representation for individuals, nor do we have a robust system of monitoring and addressing failures of healthcare across geographical locations or in respect of distinct patient populations. The noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin, said that the measures were &quot;convoluted&quot; and I am concerned that this may be just one more convolution. Moreover, many noble Lords have mentioned one glaring omission; that is, any provision in the Bill for the dissemination of information. Without that it is difficult to see how learning across the NHS can be enhanced.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>The opening statement of the Full Regulatory Impact Assessment talks of primary legislation in the following terms,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;new coherent powers to enable the scheme to be set out within a single framework of regulations as a real alternative to legislation, and one that will be more readily understood by patients and NHS staff alike&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_231"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 231</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51102-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>That is not what we have at the moment. Specialists in the field do not understand it, so I do not see how lay people can. Yet the statement gives your Lordships a good target at which to aim.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>We have a number of reservations. Some have already been mentioned. The lack of independence of the scheme is a key one, which many of your Lordships have mentioned. The lack of specialist medico-legal advice during the course of an investigation was raised most eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. On these Benches we are concerned not only that patients should be fully enabled to understand the process that they are being taken through, but also that NHS staff can have faith in a system which will explain to people&#151;in much better terms than any existing complaints system&#151;what is happening. The current system has been described by the BMA as harmful, unpredictable and unjust. So it is; but we believe that the Bill, were it to be properly framed, could rectify that.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>One other recommendation by the Chief Medical Officer in <i>Making Amends</i> was that an avoidability test would be preferable. On these Benches, we would like to see that approach probed&#151;not least because it would shift the blame away from individual practitioners and focus, perhaps, more on systemic failures. I listened with great care to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, as she made her defence of the Bolam test. Having listened to her, it seemed that there was nothing in what she said that could not have been understood by a patient. It was the sort of full explanation that patients often look for but frequently do not get. If they were getting that quality of information, then a great many cases would not come forward in the first place. An avoidability test, running alongside initiatives such as the National Patient Safety Agency in its Being open programme, would change practice in ways that would be preferable. We should spend time in Committee looking at that.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Another reason for drawing attention to the avoidability approach is that the Bill, as it stands, appears to refer only to clinical or medical errors. What is not clear is whether the scheme would include cases in which a wrong diagnosis was made, or a wrong course of treatment pursued for another reason&#151;for example, administrative failure. Clause 1 lists the healthcare staff whose actions are included in the scheme, However, it is not possible to tell, for example, if a lab technician makes a technical mistake or uses equipment which renders a treatment faulty&#151;and that, in turn, causes wrong treatment down the line&#151;whether that will be covered by the scheme. The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, made that point well.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>There are a number of detailed questions I wish to put to the Minister at this stage. I believe doing so will improve the quality of debate at subsequent stages of the Bill. Clause 1 refers to diagnosis of illness. It does not state that the scheme includes advice given to a patient. Why? Clause 8 concerns the provision of legal advice. What research has been done to ascertain the effect on the Legal Aid Fund? In Clause 8(2) there is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_232"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 232</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reference to a &quot;specified person&quot; who will prepare a list of providers of legal advice. Who will that specified person be?
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Clause 9 deals with assistance for individuals seeking redress under the scheme. It is not clear who should provide the advice, or how they will be paid. Noble Lords will require clarification of that. Clause 9(1) appears to be a provision for the Secretary of State to be given the power to appoint a representative to assist an applicant:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;by way of representation or otherwise&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>What does that mean?
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Clause 10 refers to the requirement on members of the scheme to make payments. On what basis will contributions be made? Will there be a per capita basis for members of the scheme? Will the fees be risk-related? Will members of the scheme who carry out more complex procedures have to pay weighted contributions? Or will members who have a comparatively poor track record have to pay higher levels of contributions?
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Clause 10 also requires a scheme member to charge a specified person with responsibility for overseeing the scheme. How will that requirement relate to clinical governance and existing complaint arrangements?
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>Clause 12 deals with the extremely important matter of disclosure but its drafting is extremely confusing. Does the clause apply to applicants, to scheme members or to both? Access to information is at the heart of any process of investigation or redress and it would be in the best interests of the debate if the Minister could answer this question at an early stage.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I have one final set of questions for the Minister. How will the scheme be monitored, reviewed and evaluated? How will learning from individual cases be made known and acted upon throughout the NHS? That will be the true test of whether or not the proposals work. It could turn a cost-avoidance measure into a real driver for change and improvement.
</p>

<a name="51102-09_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>The Minister will be well aware from today&#039;s debate that there is good will towards the Bill. This reflects the good will of the population towards the NHS and, as the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, has told us, the desire among people in Britain to remain supportive of our National Health Service and to prevent an American-style litigation culture entering our healthcare system. This kind of legislation involving technical matters comes up once in a very long while, but it provides an important opportunity for the House and Parliament to be at one with the British people in saving our NHS from unnecessary and undue interference from litigation. For all those reasons, I hope the Minister will be expansive in his answers and enable us to speed the passage of the Bill, in an improved form, through the House.

</p>

<a name="51102-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>It may be a small Bill, but it has stirred much interest. My own interest stems from when I was a board member and deputy complaints convener of the Salford Royal Hospitals NHS Trust. I say to the noble Baronesses, Lady Murphy and Lady Tonge, that the drafting of letters and getting the tone right is not easy. After one investigation I wrote a letter which was open, warm and understanding&#151;and was immediately reported to the ombudsman because it was not legalistic. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, whom I first met at Hope Hospital, that his voice sounds lovely and that it did not affect his customary good common sense in any way whatever.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>As my noble friend Lord Howe said in his opening speech, the need to reform the system is plain. We are glad that legislative time has been found to consider this issue, albeit two years after the Chief Medical Officer&#039;s excellent second report, <i>Making Amends</i>. As my noble friend Lord Colwyn said, we support the idea of greater openness between patients and the medical establishment when things go wrong, but share the concerns so eloquently expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, about how effective that will be.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>We would have liked to have seen greater encouragement of mediation to resolve disputes. The use of mediation has received wide support from a number of bodies, including the NHS Confederation and doctors&#039; groups, and the NHS Litigation Authority has itself adopted a positive policy of encouraging the use of mediation.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Dr Stephanie Brown of the Medical Protection Society said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;The move away from purely financial compensation towards a more comprehensive package of redress for patients including an apology [and] explanation . . . is positive&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>And yet, by focusing, as this Bill does, on monetary compensation, the importance of factual investigation and the knowledge gained from lessons learnt are relegated.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>As many noble Lords have mentioned, and as my own experience has taught me, the majority of people who seek redress from the NHS simply want an answer to the many questions they ask themselves. They want the opportunity to meet the clinicians face to face. In some cases that will be an important part of the grief process, a necessary component if families and individuals are to move on with their lives. Some just want someone to say that they are sorry. There is also a strong sense of the greater good, a need to know that things will change and that wherever possible the same thing will not happen to another person.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a> An important litmus test of any scheme that seeks to rectify a wrong is public confidence in that scheme. The Bill will not increase public confidence in the NHS redress system if it enables the NHS to be judge and jury. If the NHS investigates the fault and then awards compensation against itself there is a clear conflict. We on these Benches agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, that the redress scheme <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_234"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 234</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should be robust and limited to an independent fact-finding investigation with the power to make recommendations to avoid the recurrence of similar events. It should not extend to finding blame or paying compensation. The factual explanation received can be used as the basis of a compensation claim which may have a better and fairer outcome for the patient outside the redress scheme. Our proposals reflect patient expectations and priorities.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>We support steps to encourage and support those with a real claim but seek to prevent those looking to attack the NHS unreasonably. As the Medical Protection Society has said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;a fair balance needs to be achieved between the rights of patients to receive compensation and the rights of healthcare workers not to be criticised unfairly&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The Bill takes no measures to protect the NHS against spurious claims and also may encourage patients to settle for &#163;20,000 or less when they should receive more. The Department of Health already acknowledges that that may lead to an increase in costs. Indeed, as the Bill provides for free independent legal advice, how does the Minister know that the cost of legal aid will be reduced? There seems little point in replicating structures and bureaucracies within the NHS when they already exist outside, so the Bill must not replicate the work of the courts; particularly when the Government claim that they are trying to cut down on red tape and improve the effectiveness of public services. Nor must it be allowed to become a free lunch ticket for ambulance chasers.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to establish, by regulation, a scheme for the victims of medical accidents to obtain redress without recourse to legal proceedings. There have been major concerns that it is a little light on detail. To pick up on an important point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin, if patient X turns down an offer of compensation under the scheme having received free legal advice, will he be denied access to legal aid?
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>As my noble friend Lord Howe highlighted,      we will be looking during the course of the Bill to flush out more detail on how the scheme will operate,      who will be making particular decisions, the eligibility criteria and awards available. As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said, the Bill raises many questions. We will be taking a close look at Clause 11 and like the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, we will want to question the composition of the body that will run the scheme and the nature of any tribunal that will determine liability.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>There appears to be a provision in Clause 9(1) for the Secretary of State to be given the power to appoint a representative to assist an applicant,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;by way of representation or otherwise&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="51102-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>We would like to probe the intention of this clause. Any applicant under the scheme, if he or she so wishes, must have the freedom to make their own choice of a person or organisation to assist with any claim. In the absence of freedom of choice, doubts are bound to arise about the impartiality of the adviser.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>The Bill presented the Government with the opportunity to do just that. Yet I share the concerns of my noble friend Lord Howe and others that this opportunity was wasted.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>The British people are not revengeful. Nor do I believe that we yet have a compensation culture. Research shows that following a clinical event that goes wrong, most patients are not after money; as the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, said, they just want an explanation and, where appropriate, an apology. By concentrating as it does on compensation, our greatest concern is that through the Bill, we may end up with the one thing that we are trying to avoid.

<a name="51102-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, this has been an interesting debate on an important Bill but, I have to acknowledge, there have been varying degrees of enthusiasm for the Government&#039;s approach. However, I take some comfort from the level of support for the Bill&#039;s underlying principle that those who are damaged by their healthcare deserve a better response than the one they currently receive.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I was a bit disappointed by the approach of the two Opposition Front Benches; we will no doubt come back to their concerns in Committee. I gently say to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that I was a bit surprised to hear, by his own acknowledgment, that the Conservative Front Bench wanted to create a lengthier, more bureaucratic scheme involving a second body&#151;the Healthcare Commission, possibly&#151;which already has onerous duties. I was particularly surprised, given the noises that have come from the Conservative Front Bench in the other place about excessive bureaucracy and the need to cut red tape. I ask the noble Earl to reflect on the fact that when we get to Committee, we shall look very carefully at whether proposals from Opposition parties would make the scheme lengthier, more bureaucratic, less easy to work and would create a more complicated set of arrangements for patients to work their way through. I hope that we will be able to keep those considerations in our mind as we discuss the details of the scheme in Committee.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>A number of noble Lords referred to the report <i>Making Amends</i> and have implied that we have cavalierly dropped most of the Chief Medical Officer&#039;s recommendations. The NHS redress scheme is designed to take forward one recommendation, but we are working with other government departments to take forward other reforms proposed in <i>Making Amends</i>. For example, we are taking forward recommendations 6 and 8 on reforms to the NHS complaints procedure and we are considering taking forward recommendation 17, which will prevent court awards reflecting the cost of private treatment as part <br>&nbsp;<br>

of wider reform to Section 2(4) of the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948 in conjunction with the Department for Constitutional Affairs. I am very happy to write to noble Lords before Committee to set out how some of the proposals are being taken forward in a different way outside the Bill, so that there is no misunderstanding when the Bill reaches Committee.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>A number of noble Lords have referred to why the scheme for severely neurologically impaired babies is not in the Bill. Since <i>Making Amends</i> was published, the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services has been published. This is a 10-year plan and includes a developmental national standard to address the requirements of all young people who are disabled. On 12 October 2005, we published a statement of intent which sets out action planned and already under way to meet the complex needs of this group of children.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I remind noble Lords that, because of the high value of financial redress attached to such cases, severely neurologically impaired babies are likely to be outside the scope of the NHS redress scheme. However, I can give further and better particulars on this issue to noble Lords in writing before Committee.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>Several noble Lords asked why the scheme does not currently cover primary care settings. Most incidents of clinical negligence in primary care settings would result in very small-value claims the handling of which would incur high administrative costs. GPs and other primary care practitioner organisations have private indemnity arrangements with the Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society. As the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, said, these are private organisations which collect insurance-type premiums from their members. Further discussions need to be held with the stakeholders to establish how funding flows would work if the NHS Litigation Authority as the scheme authority were to take over a significant proportion of their low-value claims via the NHS redress scheme. Inevitably, that would need amendments to legislation, but it is a complicated issue.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The issue of rights of appeal was raised by a number of noble Lords. At present, the Bill does not propose the right of appeal, but if a patient is dissatisfied with an offer made under the scheme, the patient may reject the offer and seek redress through the courts. Patients will get access to the independent legal advice on the offer that is made to them without charge.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I was asked whether there would be an independent element. The aim of the NHS redress scheme is to support local resolution. However, where patients are unhappy, a complaints procedure will be in place.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Several noble Lords asked about time limits. The detail of the scheme will be set out in secondary legislation. I assure noble Lords that it is intended that full consultation will take place to ensure that the fine detail of the scheme&#151;such as the exact time limits that will be set at each stage&#151;is worked out in a way that enables the scheme to operate effectively in practice.

<a name="51102-10_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>I could not resist smiling&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, caught me&#151;when she was delighting the House with stories of exhausted health professionals bowed down by government targets. I remind her gently that those targets arose because patients actually made the not unreasonable request that we improved access to GPs, improved accident and emergency services and had shorter waiting lists. I am sorry if she and her colleagues are bowed down, but I read recently in the media that our GPs were actually paid rather well compared with the rest of Europe so there seems to be some compensation for the onerous responsibilities that they discharge. As I remember, GPs were relieved of their obligations on out-of-hours services under the changes that we introduced as a result of discussion with them. I thought that we should put the record straight in that particular area.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>Noble Lords raised the important issue of whether we could be heading towards a US-style litigation culture. The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, touched on that. In terms of clinical negligence claims specifically, claims against the NHS actually continue to fall. An average of 439 claims per month were made under the clinical negligence scheme for trusts in 2004&#150;05 compared with 481 in 2003&#150;04. That is still more than we would like, but the trend is not going upwards: it is going in the opposite direction.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Several noble Lords, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, in particular, raised the issue of the Bolam test. Any offer of redress will be made only on the basis of a liability in tort arising under the law of England and Wales. The same test for negligence as applied in civil proceedings will be applied to cases under the redress scheme. Those tests are currently the Bolam and Bolitho tests. The Bolam test provides that a professional is not negligent if their practice was in accordance with that accepted as proper at the time of treatment by a responsible body of medical opinion, even though other doctors adopt a different practice. I will not go into the detail of that, but I am trying to reassure her that we are not changing the test in any way under this legislation.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The noble Lord raised the issue of the NHS Litigation Authority having a conflict of interest. I am anxious not to end up with such a complicated set of arrangements that they are off-putting to patients. It is intended that any patient who is offered a settlement under the scheme will be given the opportunity to have the offer assessed by independent legal advice, which will be provided without charge. It is not just the NHS Litigation Authority calling all the shots, although it has considerable expertise. We can go into the detail of determining liability at the appropriate level in Committee. The measure has a lot to offer, and I hope, in Committee, to convince your Lordships of that.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>Noble Lords have rightly chided us and asked when they will know the detail of the scheme. Regulations will not be published until after Royal Assent, but there will be full consultation on draft regulations before the scheme starts, which we envisage to be April 2007. The issue of whether it will take the NHS in the wrong direction regarding how it deals with patients&#039; <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_238"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 238</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

concerns has been raised. We know, and I shall give further and better particulars in Committee, that many of the best trusts are already looking at how best to respond to patients when things go wrong. We want to support all NHS organisations to reach that standard, and we think that the Bill will help to do that.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The issue of whether the NHS redress scheme will cover MRSA was raised. The scheme will cover claims arising out of hospital services provided to patients as part of the National Health Service in England. It may cover cases involving MRSA if there is liability in tort and the case falls below the financial threshold. I like dealing with health Bills in this House as we invariably get on to the issue of cross-border flows between England and Wales. No doubt we shall discuss that subject in Committee when I shall no doubt receive support from the noble Baroness, Lady Royall. I can tell the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that the Department of Health and the Assembly have been working together on the proposals. Wales has broad regulation-making powers that do not commit it to establishing a scheme. However, clear guidance will be developed for all cross-border services, and commissioning responsibilities will be agreed at the outset. There will be no uncertainty for patients or providers.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I was asked whether doctors would be blamed, but the scheme is intended to resolve claims outside the adversarial process. We do not think it is likely that the scheme will increase the possibility of doctors being blamed. Claims under &#163;20,000 currently cover about 75 per cent of settled claims. My noble friend Lord Parekh asked about the number of claims involved in the past few years. The average number of settled claims under &#163;20,000 in financial years 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 was around 4,000 a year. That represents approximately 75 per cent of settled claims. I was asked whether the cost limit included remedial treatment costs. It does not. Remedial care based on clinical need will be provided under the NHS as a matter of course in particular cases.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked who would hold the list of solicitors. It is intended that the list will be made available by the Legal Services Commission. She also asked whether misdiagnosis would be covered. Any case when there is a liability in tort, based on the current legal test, will be eligible, provided that liability arises out of services provided in hospital and in consequence of the act or omission of a healthcare professional. That would be the test applied if there were concerns about misdiagnosis.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>I was asked how the scheme would be funded. We expect it to be funded along the same lines as the clinical negligence scheme for trusts. The detail of the funding mechanisms will be set out in secondary legislation and the contribution paid by each scheme member will be advised by the NHS Litigation Authority. Contributions may be adjusted in the light of the relevant risk rating of each individual scheme member.
</p>

<a name="51102-10_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a> I have tried to cover as best as I can some of the issues raised. I assure noble Lords that I shall study <i>Hansard</i> carefully and will reply to all the questions to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_239"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 239</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which I have not given full and frank answers in this debate. As it is in my best interests, I shall endeavour that the letters get to noble Lords before Committee, so I can guarantee to write to noble Lords on those particular issues.

<a name="51102-11_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Millennium Review Summit (EUC Report)</h3>
<a name="time_16"></a>
<a name="51102-11_time0"></a><h5>5.12 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="51102-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bowness </b>   rose to move, That this House takes note of the report of the European Union Committee on the European Union&#039;s Role at the millennium review summit.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this relatively short report was produced during the summer in anticipation of the millennium review summit, which was held in September. Before turning to the substance of the report itself, I record my thanks to the members of Sub-Committee C of the European Union Committee for their work in the preparation of the report; to Benita Ferrero Waldner, the Commissioner for External Affairs; to Mr Daws, the Executive Director of the United Nations Association in the United Kingdom; to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the former representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations; and to Mr Douglas Alexander, the Minister for Europe, for giving evidence to the committee. I also record our particular thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, who, before joining the sub-committee as a member and assisting us with his knowledge and expertise of the subject also, as long ago as May 2004, gave evidence to the committee on the work of the Secretary General&#039;s high-level panel of which he was a distinguished member.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>There was pressure to produce the report by the summer, and I am grateful to Emily Baldock, the committee clerk, and Pamela Strigo, the committee specialist, in the drafting of the report and enabling us to meet our self-imposed deadline.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The report has inevitably been overtaken by the events to which it looked forward, and I know that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, will deal with the outcome of the millennium review summit, so I do not propose to dwell too long on that myself. But it is worth looking at the report and the Government&#039;s response. In September 2005, the heads of the United Nations member states met in New York to mark the United Nations 60th anniversary. They were there to review the progress of the millennium development goals on the basis of the report commissioned from the Secretary General, entitled <i>In Larger Freedom</i>, but that report went much further. It was divided into four sections, which our report tends to follow. A much larger point was, as our report states, the question of the United Nations&#039; role in the post-Cold War world.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>We, as a sub-committee of the European Union Committee, were anxious to see what the European Union&#039;s role would be in that. The Secretary-General&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_240"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 240</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

report, <i>In Larger Freedom,</i> consisted of four main themes: Freedom from Want&#151;the Development Agenda; Freedom from Fear&#151;the Security Agenda; Freedom to Live in Dignity&#151;Human Rights and Democracy; and Strengthening the United Nations&#151;Reform of the Institutions. The sub-committee recognised at the start that the United Nations is an organisation of sovereign states. The European Union has only observer status, but we also observed, and witnesses confirmed, that among the many groups there, the European Union stands out as the most cohesive and the one that is most likely to assist in collective action. One of our recommendations, which one might have thought was a statement of the obvious, was that to ensure and endeavour to achieve a successful outcome at the summit, the European Union must advocate the case for reform, use its particular relationship with the United States and have a dialogue with countries in the other continents.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>The Secretary-General, in the &quot;Freedom from Want&quot; section of his report, urged all the UN member states to implement the global partnership between rich and poor countries. It is worth noting that the committee commended the European Union for its pre-stated commitment to increased aid. The EU is still the largest contributor to overseas development aid.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>We also commended the Government for having made a brave and principled decision to pick climate change as one of their key priorities for the United Kingdom&#039;s European Union and G8 presidencies. We urged the Government to seek agreement at the conference to begin in November and proposed that a specific date for the post-2012 discussions be included in the millennium review summit draft outcome document. We would like to hear from the Government whether those discussions commenced on time.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Regarding &quot;Freedom from Fear&#151;the Security Agenda&quot;, we urged the European Union to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;press for new principles on the application of force&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>and we endorsed the concept of the responsibility to protect. We are pleased that that was recognised. We also suggested that the Government should press for as much detail as possible in the conclusions regarding the setting up of a peacebuilding commission. Although the Government agreed with that in their response, one of the key issues as we see it is that it is not clear how that will relate to and work with the Security Council. It would be extremely helpful if the Minister could respond to that. We were also concerned that a definition of terrorism should be achieved at the summit. That has not happened and, with great respect to the Government, their response is set out in rather complacent terms, bearing in mind that that was a particularly important issue.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Regarding the section, &quot;Freedom to Live in Dignity&quot;, the sub-committee supported the proposal for a new human rights council which we hoped would be more effective than the existing institution. We hoped that the Government and the European Union would support the measures proposed at the summit <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_241"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 241</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that would strengthen the UN&#039;s human rights machinery. As we understand it, that new institution was established but, again, can the Minister give us more detail and information on the progress that has been achieved?
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>On the reform agenda, strengthening the United Nations institutions, we always knew that reform of the Security Council was not a matter on which the member states of the European Union would be able to agree. Indeed, that proved to be the case. We also called for the Government to indicate how they believed the United Nations General Assembly could, in the words of the report, be revitalised and work towards the Secretary-General&#039;s reforms. The government response indicates that a working group was set up, but it does not indicate what proposals and measures the Government would advocate and be pressing in conjunction with our partners in Europe.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Lastly, I draw noble Lords&#039; attention to the fact that, while the outcome of the summit achieved only partial success, the European Union itself was successful in producing a co-ordinated position at the summit. As I have already said, with the exception of the Security Council, that co-ordinated position seems to have been maintained throughout the process. By focusing on the areas of agreement, the European Union was able to contribute positively to the positive elements of the outcome of the summit&#151;a lesson which we should perhaps consider when we sometimes discuss the desirability, or not, of having a common foreign and security policy. Failure to be able to agree on absolutely everything is no reason not to try to achieve agreement on as much as possible. The result of the summit in that regard at least suggests that those efforts were not only for Europe&#039;s collective benefit but also for the benefit of the United Nations. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Moved, That this House takes note of the report of the European Union Committee on the European Union&#039;s Role at the millennium review summit.&#151;(<i>Lord Bowness</i>.)

</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="51102-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Truscott: </b>   My Lords, I begin by commending the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, for the excellent way in which he guided the EU Sub-Committee C through all the various stages of the report. As the noble Lord mentioned, we also benefited from the expertise and special knowledge of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who appeared as both a witness and a committee member and greatly assisted in the drafting of the subsequent report. I look forward to hearing his speech later in the debate.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>The importance of the EU/UN relationship is self-apparent. EU member states are the largest financial contributors to the UN system, as the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, mentioned. The EU pays 38 per cent of the UN&#039;s regular budget, more than two-fifths of the UN peacekeeping operations and around half of the UN member states&#039; contributions to UN funds and programmes. Thus, in my view, the committee&#039;s report <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_242"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 242</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is both timely and an important contribution to the debate about the role and influence of the EU within the structures of the United Nations.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>Overall, as the Minister, my noble friend Lord Triesman, told your Lordships&#039; House on 10 October, the resulting millennium review summit,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;delivered a worthwhile package of reforms and commitments&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 10/10/05; col. <i>WS 10</i>.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>My own feeling is that, although there were disappointments at the September UN world summit, there were also significant advances. The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, mentioned that one of those advances was the way in which the EU member states themselves maintained a co-ordinated approach to the negotiations at the summit. I would argue that the outcome was not as disappointing as some commentators would have your Lordships believe, and I hope that the Minister, in responding to the debate, will concur.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>There was a strong and unambiguous commitment by all governments, of donor and developing nations alike, to achieve the millennium development goals by 2015. An additional $50 billion a year would be found by 2010 to fight poverty. There was agreement to provide immediate support for quick impact initiatives to support anti-malaria efforts, education and healthcare.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>For the first time, the UN agreed a clear and unqualified condemnation of terrorism by all governments,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>There was a strong push for a comprehensive convention against terrorism within a year and support for early entry into force of the nuclear terrorism convention. The Government managed to secure the adoption of the Security Council resolution calling on all countries to ban the incitement of terrorist acts, despite the failure to agree on a definition of terrorism, as the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, mentioned.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>UN members could not agree on a definition of terrorism that treated attacks targeting civilians and non-combatants by non-state agents as terrorist acts. The logic is that similar acts by governments are already proscribed as war crimes. Some countries insisted that the definition of terrorism should exclude &quot;legitimate&quot; struggles for liberation and self-determination.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Although it is often said that one person&#039;s terrorist is another person&#039;s freedom fighter, it is disingenuous to suggest that blowing innocent children, women&#151;and men, for that matter&#151;to pieces in any political cause is other than terrorism. Was the killing of more than 150 children in Beslan in North Ossetia in September 2004 not terrorism because some of the terrorists felt that they were fighting for self-determination? I think not. Of course the world must avoid double standards, but, on the other hand, the civilised international community is entitled to say that there are lines that rational human beings should not cross, whatever the cause, whatever the war.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_243"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 243</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51102-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>The UN world summit also agreed to build a peacebuilding commission backed by a support office and a standing fund. There will also be a standing police capacity for UN peacekeeping operations. Human rights machinery is to be strengthened; a human rights council established within a year; the Convention against Corruption came into force; and a new ethics office, badly needed following the Volcker reports, will help strengthen internal oversight. There was recognition of the serious challenge posed by climate change and a commitment better to tackle HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. An improved Central Emergency Revolving Fund would ensure that relief arrived more swiftly and reliably when disasters happened. The signatories reconfirmed the Monterry consensus, in which they pledged to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7 per cent of GDP in official development assistance&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-11_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>Of course, the key is to turn those fine words into action. That process should be helped by a little-noted clause, paragraph 22a, in the outcome document, in which all UN members agree to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;adopt, by 2006, and implement comprehensive national development strategies to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-11_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>From now on, development strategies prepared by bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should be comprehensive and designed to achieve the development goals. That is a new concept which, it is hoped, will force a change in the behaviour of institutions and governments around the globe.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Another major breakthrough was the clear and unambiguous acceptance by all governments of the collective international responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. When peaceful action proves inadequate and national governments refuse to act, the Security Council will have the responsibility to protect the innocent. The responsibility to protect, which was initially resisted by Egypt, Algeria, Pakistan, India, Russia, Cuba, Iran and Syria, was finally pushed through in New York. The UN world summit is to be congratulated for overcoming resistance among some of its participants to the principle that people sometimes need to be protected from their own governments.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>Of course, the world summit was not a resounding success in all areas, as I mentioned in the case of the definition of terrorism. Secretary-General Kofi Annan rightly said that it was a &quot;disgrace&quot; that no progress had been made on disarmament at the summit. The committee&#039;s report before your Lordships&#039; House stated that the earlier NPT Review Conference was a &quot;disastrous failure&quot; and that non-proliferation should have been one of the Government&#039;s priorities in New York. The Government&#039;s response to the committee&#039;s report acknowledges disappointment in that area and promises to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;find pragmatic solutions to overcome that setback and enhance the non-proliferation regime&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_244"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 244</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51102-11_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>In the dangerous world in which we now live, solutions cannot come soon enough. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the response required by the Government in this area.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Post-2012 climate change commitments will be discussed at the December 2005 climate change conference, but the UN review summit itself took no decision on further international action. On both the peacebuilding commission and the human rights council, issues still remain outstanding. Progress on the issue of Security Council reform, on which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, expended so much effort as a member of the High Level Panel, was non-existent.
</p>

<a name="51102-11_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>The only positive thing which could be said about Security Council reform was that the subject did not derail to whole millennium review summit, as some feared it might. Reform of the General Assembly also seems some way off. Consensus among a body with 191 member states is understandably sometimes beyond the reach of even the best diplomats.

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>UN summits are not always as relevant as they might be. However, given contemporary geopolitics and the state of multilateralism, both in the wider framework and within the EU itself, this summit was always going to be a testing one. In aspiring to do as much as it sought, the UN was perhaps being over-ambitious. Perhaps it should have concentrated on the critical areas of how we might actually achieve the millennium development goals&#151;no small matter when it comes to halving extreme poverty, providing an education for all the world&#039;s children or combating the reduction of infectious diseases&#151;rather than attempting to embrace the broader, but also deeply important, agenda of UN reform.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>In the committee, we too had a wide-ranging agenda in reviewing EU relations with the UN. I will confine my remarks to three areas only: the convention on terrorism, the Human Rights Council and the reform of the UN organisational structure. In doing so, I wish <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_245"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 245</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I was speaking after the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, as his knowledge of matters relating to both the UN and the EU is far superior to almost anyone else in this House and therefore much of what I say may well be made redundant when he speaks.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>In representing the EU at the UN, and bearing in mind how much more important the EU is to the UN now, given that we contribute, as many noble Lords have said, almost 40 per cent of the regular budget, the UK Government had particular leverage at this summit. That it was able to achieve as much as it did in the context of the MDGs, and particularly in achieving agreement on responsibility to protect, is to be congratulated. However, given that the EU went into this summit in a more united position than the recent past&#151;one only has to think back to 2002 and 2003, when EU divisions would have been rather more evident&#151;it is to be regretted that more could not be achieved.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>A significant failure was the inability of the UN to arrive at a successful outcome on the convention on terrorism. Had that been achieved, it would have been of more than symbolic importance, as it would have resulted in genuine commitment on the parts of other states to meet their responsibilities in this regard. The reason we were unable to get agreement was that the Organisation of the Islamic Council, which represents 57 Muslim countries, was reluctant to agree terms whereby legitimate struggle for autonomy and/or self-determination could be made unlawful. As many of those struggles relate to Muslim populations&#151;not least those in Palestine and Kashmir, not forgetting the plight of Chinese Muslims or those in Russia&#151;it was not entirely surprising that we could not succeed. So we will probably not gain agreement on this most contentious issue of our time, and that is to be regretted.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>We should note in the context of terrorism that the UN Security Council did indeed agree Resolution 1624, which is wide-ranging. I mention it because the Government have invested so much political capital in this resolution, recalling time and again that it is now under obligation to abide by that resolution in the context of the Terrorism Bill which is currently being debated in the other place. But there is a warning here: we must be very careful not to adopt a pick-and-choose approach to international law or we will bring it into disrepute. So while our Government remind noble Lords on the opposition Benches of their commitments to multilateralism, they might pause to reflect on their own standards of adherence to measures for international peace and security in contemporary times. They should also note those sections of the resolution that call on states to take measures as may be &quot;necessary and appropriate&quot;. The resolution also stresses that states must ensure that measures comply with international human rights law. I could go into detail about why I think that Resolution 1624 does not comprehensively support the Government&#039;s case, but this is not the debate for that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51102-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>A further disappointment was the lack of progress on agreement for a human rights council. That was all the more disappointing as, I believe, the concern of certain developing countries that the new council would sideline them and work only to the Western agenda was predictable&#151;and what is predictable is, to some extent, resolvable. The failure to move forward in that regard can be explained partly by the lack of dialogue between those who could see themselves losing voice through the reforms and those who would gain. With greater forward planning we might have had progress.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The debate will now centre on how wide the membership of the council should be. I have some experience in that regard: in addition to the interest that I have already declared, I worked for the Commonwealth secretariat for several years and was responsible for the ministerial committee for human rights and democracy. On the whole, the Commonwealth committee&#151;the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group&#151;has been quite successful. In response to violations of fundamental principles in relation to Zimbabwe and Pakistan, it was able to bring some sanctions to bear. If the human rights council is to have any influence in advancing human rights, the one lesson that we should draw from the Commonwealth is to keep the council a reasonable size to achieve coherence for oversight. Current thinking is that the council may have as many as 47 to 50 members. That should be avoided. Creating a body with a quarter of the membership of the UN will not be the recipe for achieving either consensus or common positions. An effective council must have a manageable membership, and the EU should bear that in mind, even if it has to compromise its own interests in terms of membership and numbers. In doing so it will advance the cause of human rights overall, and that must be a good thing.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Finally, I come to the overhaul of the UN system itself. The UN Secretary-General commented two years ago that the UN was at a fork in the road: on one side lay reform and renewal and on the other lay growing irrelevance. Those sentiments expressed a growing sense of frustration among capitals that the UN could no longer just muddle along; however, that seems to be where we find ourselves and where the EU, as a significant contributor across the board, has much leverage. That it failed to achieve the required reforms will have direct implications for the UN&#039;s present accountability and future mandates. At present, the mismanagement of the oil for food programme is a case in point. As the Volker report made clear, the split responsibilities between the secretariat, the Security Council and the General Assembly render the lines of accountability much more diffuse. An overhaul of the UN staffing regime is also needed, if only to clear out dead wood with a move to greater flexibility to achieve staff turnover, which would greatly benefit efficiency. A streamlined secretariat, with clearly defined and greater powers for the Secretary-General, is needed.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Overall, the summit was a missed opportunity for both the UN and the EU. That we failed to achieve the radical but necessary reforms means that we will have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_247"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 247</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to muddle through a bit longer. However, a debate is now under way, and we must be determined to continue pushing the reform agenda even as we hand over the EU presidency. Our responsibility as a permanent member has historically been discharged with great commitment. We look forward to renewal of that commitment towards both the UN and the EU.

<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="51102-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   My Lords, it could be thought that for this House to be debating a report on the European Union&#039;s role in the UN millennium review summit, which took place a little over a month ago in New York, might be missing the bus, but I do not believe that is so. This report ranges a good deal more widely than the agenda of the summit meeting itself. It looks into what the United Nations means for the EU&#039;s emerging common foreign and security policy, and looks also at what the EU&#039;s member states, acting jointly through that policy, can and should be doing at and for the UN.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>The report also constitutes a kind of baseline from which to judge the outcome of the summit. As a newcomer to his sub-committee I would like to convey a word of appreciation to the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, who chaired our deliberations so ably, and to our excellent staff who helped to put together our report under considerable pressure of time, not to mention the &quot;noises off&quot; such as the atrocities on the Underground on 7 July, which coincided precisely with one of our meetings, and certainly concentrated our minds on one of the main threats facing this country and the UN as a whole: terrorism.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I have seen it suggested that the EU&#039;s input into the preparation of the millennium review summit was a bit feeble and inadequate; that its collective voice was not properly heard. That is nonsense. Not only was a dialogue struck up from the outset with the two members of the high-level panel from EU countries, myself and M Robert Badinter&#151;to whose perspicacity and contribution I pay tribute&#151;but a detailed written submission by the EU was entered in July 2004. In June this year the heads of state and government of the EU adopted a position highly supportive of the UN Secretary-General&#039;s reform proposals, and, in the long and tortuous&#151;not to say tortured&#151;negotiations over the outcome document, the EU, under the leadership of the British permanent representative, played a prominent and unfailingly constructive role without which, it can safely be said, there would have been no agreed outcome at all. I know of no other country or group of countries that made a greater input into the preparation of the summit, nor of any whose policy prescriptions were such a close fit with the proposals put forward by the panel and the Secretary-General.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>As previous speakers have mentioned, on the proposal regarding enlargement of the Security Council and the question of whether that should include new permanent members, the EU was divided from the outset and remained so to the end. On the rest it was united, as it was on the overall proposition that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_248"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 248</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reforming and strengthening the UN was a major objective of its policy. Not too bad a score, I would suggest.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Why does the UN matter so much to the EU? The answer is simple, and it is set out in our report. The EU has major global interests to defend and to further, but it does not suffer from the illusion that it can do that unaided, powerful and prosperous though it may be thought to be by some; nor does it seek to become some sort of superpower, let alone a &quot;superstate&quot;, aspiring to get its way outside the constraints of international law and practice. So it has nailed its colours to the concept of effective multilateralism, one of the leitmotifs of its own security strategy. For effective multilateralism to work, you need an effective UN that can deliver on the tasks it is set collectively by the international community.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Why, in its turn, does the EU matter so much to the UN? The answer is a matter of simple arithmetic. Some 40&#150;50 per cent of the resources of all UN programmes come from the enlarged European Union. It goes wider than that, however. For the UN to work effectively it needs the firm support of a critical mass of countries that have worldwide outreach and the resources and political will to back up the UN when the going gets rough. The EU has at least the potential to provide that, even if hitherto it has often fallen a bit short of doing so.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>What is one to say about the September summit? I myself would say two cheers at best; certainly not three. Quite a lot of highly desirable proposals got lost on the way. Enlargement of the Security Council remains stuck, as it has been for over 10 years. It will return, like Banquo&#039;s ghost, to haunt the UN&#039;s deliberations. The proposal to set guidelines for the collective use of force fell foul of an unholy alliance of those who thought that they were too constrictive and those who thought that they were too permissive. The decisions on counter-proliferation policy were simply dropped in their entirety, an ominous omission that bodes ill for the future, following as it does the debacle of last May&#039;s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. The truncation of the responsibilities of the new Peacebuilding Commission to exclude conflict prevention will surely come to be regretted.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>Nevertheless, set against those failures is a certain number of successes: the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission; the endorsement of a strategy against terrorism and the commitment to a comprehensive convention that, in my view and that of other speakers, needs to outlaw any targeting of civilians or non-combatants; the commitment to the responsibility to protect those whose governments cannot or will not do so themselves; the decision to set up a new council on human rights; and the measures to make the work of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the secretariat more relevant, better focused and more accountable. There is also the recalibration of the millennium development goals with additional resources and a new sense of purpose. I would argue that the decisions that were taken represent a critical mass of reforms of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_249"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 249</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

real value, a reform programme that could be seen as being wider in scope than any adopted since the UN was set up in 1945.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Will it all happen? Will it work? That, naturally, will depend on the follow-up and the implementation. If the Doha development round bogs down; if the new dialogue on global warming runs into the sands; if the convention on terrorism is shipwrecked on the quicksands of disagreement over definitions; if the first case of need to exercise the responsibility to protect is fluffed, flunked or fudged, as has happened so often; if the resources for the development policies and the policies themselves fall short of the promises of Gleneagles and New York; or if the Peacebuilding Commission becomes a fifth wheel rather than a motor for post-conflict peace building, it will be yet another false dawn, yet another opportunity missed.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>That brings us back to the European Union&#039;s role. It cannot on its own be determinant in the positive sense on any of the issues. Wider co-operation is needed than simply among members of the European Union. There must be co-operation with developing countries and, above all, the emerging giants among them, such as China, India, Brazil, Nigeria and South Africa. There must be co-operation with the United States, whose somewhat enigmatic and ambivalent approach to UN reform and the summit still leaves plenty of unanswered questions. There must also be co-operation with the long-term, stalwart supporters of the UN, such as Canada and Japan, whose approach often matches closely that of the European Union.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The European Union&#039;s role can be and often is determinant in the negative sense. If it does not provide resources in men, money and political backing, the UN will get nowhere. I hope that we shall hear from the Minister how the Government, during the rest of their EU and G8 presidencies, will set those organisations off along the long and arduous path of effective implementation of the reforms endorsed. Also, how do the Government intend to proceed in the areas in which nothing has been achieved, most pressingly on counter-proliferation policy?
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The European Union has a particular stake in the whole process that relates to its internal development as well as to the wider world. There is no doubt that the European Union, like the UN, is going through choppy seas. Like the UN, it needs reform. In the case of the European Union, the institutional path to reform is not only inadequate on its own but is probably blocked for some considerable time, following the negative outcomes of the French and Dutch referendums. I believe that, in the immediate future, the EU&#039;s salvation lies through making its policies more effective, more credible and more apt to the needs of its citizens. That is the best way&#151;perhaps the only way&#151;to rebuild the support that has ebbed away but is there to be regained.
</p>

<a name="51102-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>One of the EU policies that needs to be developed, strengthened and made more visible and comprehensible to the general public is the common foreign and security policy. Is it to remain a mass of <br>&nbsp;<br>

apparently meaningless acronyms, a system for writing cheques while others shape the decisions, or is it gradually to become a means of delivering outcomes that our citizens genuinely want and value, such as greater security against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; greater respect for human rights world-wide; and greater prosperity and freedom from disease, hunger and want for those less fortunately placed than ourselves? It is to answering those questions that the European Union must now address itself with renewed determination and purpose.

<a name="51102-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, first, I echo what has been said by a number of speakers. As my noble friend Lord Truscott said, we are grateful to our chairman for his leadership during the writing of the report by the committee of which I am a member. We are grateful in particular to the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who has demonstrated during the past few minutes exactly why his unique overview and ability to see the whole problem of the UN in the round from his experience as an ambassador and on the high level panel was a uniquely valuable contribution to our work. I hope that I do not plagiarise his speech, but my balance sheet will sound somewhat similar.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>I echo my noble friend Lord Truscott. I was not aware of the remarkable statistic&#151;it is reproduced on page 12 of the report&#151;that the EU countries together provide 38 per cent of the UN budget. The United States provide 22 per cent. The United States are the sole superpower. There is not time to compare the United Nations with the League of Nations. However, perhaps we should reflect on one or two points of impasse regarding non-proliferation and the Security Council&#151;there are some pluses on climate change&#151;reflecting on the constitution in a broader sense.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>There has always been a problem with organisations where everyone has a right to be a member. The African Union is different, therefore, from the European Union. We shall study the relationship between the African Union and the European Union and scrutinise it in a wider sense over the next few months leading to a proposed EU/AU summit. Different organisations have different internal dynamics. To get them to move forward and to take on more authority is a constitutional question. It is obvious that the United Nations is only as strong as some of the contributions made by key members of the Security Council&#151;the United States, <i>primus inter pares,</i> and it must be true of China and Russia. It is somewhat disturbing that the new US ambassador to the United Nations is not looking for a stronger role for the UN. Yet when we consider specific policies, as my noble friend Lord Hannay, said, all the forces of history demand that.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Perhaps I may make a slightly jocular aside. For 35 years I helped to run the TUC, in various lowly and less lowly capacities. When we got into difficulties, going round in circles and going nowhere in particular, we always used to say, &quot;The problem is that running the TUC is rather like running the United Nations. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_251"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 251</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

You can&#039;t really do anything as you have very big members throwing their weight about&quot;. To coin a phrase, the problem with running the United Nations is a little like running the TUC. That may not have the same resonance with other people as it has with me, but it is worth reflecting on what is needed to make an organisation cohere.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>Compared with the UN, the EU has some remarkable success stories. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, touched on one or two of them. Even drawing up and agreeing between the 25 member states a substantive report on the non-proliferation treaty that formed the hymn sheet to be used in New York was quite an achievement. The common foreign and security policy is a fancy title because it has to be based on unanimity, but historians will look back and note that the EU is doing more and more at an impressive speed. I am sure that that is the kind of setting against which we ought to judge some of the less than brilliantly successful outcomes we have seen recently.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>We have seen the UN move a considerable distance on climate change over the past 13 to 14 years. In 1992 I happened to be an expert adviser as part of the UK delegation to the Earth Summit held in Rio. At the time the possibility that the Kyoto Protocol would be agreed in any form, and that the newly developing industrial nations such as India, China and Brazil would relate to the system, was very remote. The debating point of the day was that it was the duty of the great industrialised powers of the developed world, those which created pollution with their carbon dioxide emissions, to give the lead; we could not expect the participation of India and China. Today we are finding the modalities where that is starting to happen. In historical terms, that is happening over a short period.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner of Margravine, said that there is a crisis of multilateralism. I tend to agree, but it is worth stating its nature .
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="51102-13_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Falkner of Margravine: </b>   My Lords, just on a point of clarification, I do not believe I said that there is a crisis of multilateralism, rather that we have obligations as multilateralists.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="51102-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, I apologise if I wrongly paraphrased the noble Baroness. But I think that there is a crisis of multilateralism, and I shall put it in my own terms. There should be a form of high-level brainstorming on the nature of the negotiation which is now meant to be developing on issues such as the non-proliferation treaty. The traditional way in which documents are drawn up for meetings such as the NPT review conference, which was such a comprehensive failure, shows that lessons ought to be learnt. During their presidency, which has only another six weeks to run, could Her Majesty&#039;s Government put into play the notion that there ought to be a reflection on what the failure of the NPT review conference can tell us about the nature of multilateral modalities? I ask that because we have another fast-emerging problem; that is, the Iranian question.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51102-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>We have suggested both in the report on the non-proliferation treaty and more generally that it would be desirable to experiment, through Britain, France and Germany, with reporting to the Council of Ministers, and then Europe taking a lead in the UN system. There has been some rather facile talk recently of going to the Security Council. To do what, exactly? Either building on the alliance of the UK, France and Germany or the failure of the NPT treaty conference, it would be very useful indeed for the Government to give a lead to the setting up of a high-level forum or brains trust&#151;it does not matter what it is called&#151;to think through some of the problems attached to the modalities of multilateral negotiation.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>On millennium development goals more generally, I do not agree with the noble Baroness on this occasion. I definitely do not agree that we should have given more prominence in New York to the progress on MDGs. I see totally the reverse. MDGs are, in a sense, dependent on an average 7 per cent economic growth across the developing world. That is a tremendously ambitious target, but what is the problem with achieving it? It is largely, in our analysis, the problems of corruption, of governance and money-laundering&#151;which comes back to London and Jersey and such places. It is also the problem of trade, with the Doha round, and the problem that in Africa we have a doctrine of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. That is the problem with the MDGs and getting to that 7 per cent. It is not just waving magic wands about economic arithmetic. We now have an ambitious agenda because we cannot avoid some of these challenging questions.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>The Front Bench may be glad to know that I want to conclude by asking for this note to be attached to the Government&#039;s reply. I do not think anyone else has mentioned the interesting note in the annexe on conditionality. There is a not unintelligent attempt there at some rehabilitation of conditionality, which ought to be addressed as a key point in the response. We have moved away from the idea that conditionality is a disgrace. We say that it is part of the condition for making progress. That is very true in Africa and Latin America. It would be useful if the Minister could comment on that. The EU can set conditions in its negotiations with Africa and Latin America simply because it cannot easily be accused of, or represented as being, imperialist in the way that an individual country like Britain, France, Spain or Portugal&#151;the whole lot of us&#151;can be separately.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>My conclusion is that this whole exercise has demonstrated the tremendous innate power for development for the better in the world through the developing role of the European Union.

questions than the European Union&#039;s role at the millennium review summit. Indeed, as the introduction states, it:

</p>

<a name="51102-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>One key question with wide implications arises within the first section of Chapter 3 of the report, &quot;The EU&#039;s importance to the UN&quot;. Several references have been made to quite startling data, but if I may mention them again; member states of the EU contribute 38 per cent of the United Nations&#039; regular budget, which compares with 22 per cent contributed by the United States. More than 40 per cent of the UN&#039;s peace-keeping role costs are met by EU member states. This question, then, seems to arise logically in my mind: is the EU&#039;s role in the United Nations, and through it, commensurate with its budgetary contribution?
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Judging by the way the media see this issue, the answer is, &quot;Certainly not&quot;.

<a name="51102-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>When the UN&#039;s future is discussed in terms of crisis, it is often because of US scepticism about the UN and, indeed, the desultory nature of the financial contributions of the United States. By contrast, the European Union&#039;s contribution, if it is discussed at all, is taken for granted. I suspect that its extent and dimension is little known, and the committee has made an important contribution to the debate by drawing attention to these figures.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>It is unsurprising, in a way, that the European Union&#039;s contribution to the UN is somewhat taken for granted because the European Union is based on multilateralism, as indeed is the UN. To an extent, they are birds of a feather. There are, of course, signs now&#151;and many in the House will be pleased about these signs&#151;that the United States Administration is taking the United Nations more seriously than it did at its outset. It nevertheless remains true that, both in its rhetoric and, indeed, in quite large slices of its thinking, the United States Administration is, by instinct and emotion, seriously unilateralist.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>In giving evidence to the committee, Sir Jeremy Greenstock expressed this most tactfully. He said that United States Governments have failed to resolve the dichotomy of wanting, on the one hand,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;the United Nations to do things to make the world better which the United States does not want to do&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>but opposing the evolution of a global body in the UN,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;that can take decisions properly the business of the United States&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>That is a very diplomatic expression of the dichotomy, which is clear. It goes to the heart of the difference between the EU and the United Nations, and, indeed, between the EU and the United States, in their approach to these issues. The European Union is not only committed to multilateralism but also, historically and in its whole dynamic, to pooling sovereignty where this enables us to do together what we cannot do separately. In theory, this is what the Security Council is meant to be able to achieve, and historically it occasionally has.

<a name="51102-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>But it is famously what it was not able to do over Iraq. Again, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, explained why. The European Union, like the United Nations,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;very considerably is governed in its business by decisions of political leaders in their national context&quot;.</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The report concludes that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;This was demonstrated by the divisions over the war in Iraq&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>The question for the European Union, however, given the scale of its contribution, is whether it will be more effective&#151;and more true to itself&#151;if agreements to act collectively at the UN are more frequent and, indeed, the norm.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Does the Minister believe that there is a case for the European Union to be itself represented on a permanent basis in the Security Council? She shakes her head. In that case, because it is not a surprising response&#151;it is a response shared by France for much the same reason&#151;is it not an almost automatic consequence that Her Majesty&#039;s Government should consider supporting German membership of the Security Council on a permanent basis?
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>Turning to the Doha round, the WTO trade negotiations, the role of the CAP in all this and prospects for the Hong Kong summit, the Government&#039;s response to the report&#039;s conclusions are admirable as far as they go, which I suggest is not quite far enough. Thus, in responding to the report&#039;s challenge in its summary at chapter 8, they state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;As EU Presidency, we will work closely with the Commission, our EU partners and other WTO members to build on the progress made so far to ensure a successful and pro-development outcome at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December. This will allow us to achieve our aim of completing the WTO Round by the end of 2006. A successful trade round has the potential to lift 140 million people off subsidence of less than $2 a day . . . We will continue to press for reform of the CAP and other developed countries&#039; trade-distorting agricultural policies&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-13_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>I imagine that that is to a considerable extent a reference to the policies of the United States. They go on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;Within the WTO Round, we will push for improved market access for developing countries, reductions in trade-distorting domestic support and agreement on an end date for agricultural export subsidies at Hong Kong&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-13_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The trouble with those statements of good intent is, to go back to Sir Jeremy Greenstock&#039;s neat phrase, the decisions of political leaders in their national context: specifically, President Chirac being difficult and seeking to prevent Mr Mandelson from being good. There was President Chirac at Hampton Court declaring France&#039;s right not to approve any Doha outcome that undermines the 2003 CAP agreement: not 40 per cent cuts; no more than 25 per cent. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, in this House on Monday, advised President Chirac&#151;I certainly enjoyed this word of advice&#151;to read the Nice treaty, because if he did so he would discover that he had no veto. However, we have a record of signing European treaties allegedly without having read them either.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_255"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 255</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51102-13_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Before we all succumb to the pleasures of seeing Mr Mandelson as a righteous crusader&#151;a slightly alarming prospect&#151;let us try to remember that the countries of the developing world do not see even a 40 per cent cut as enabling them to surmount the hurdles facing their agricultural exports. The reason is simple: the Uruguay round set such high ceilings for United States and EU subsidies that insurmountable hurdles will remain even with a 40 per cent CAP cut. Will Her Majesty&#039;s Government recognise that and seek despite the difficulties with France and others to go beyond the rhetoric to the realities of what would actually make a difference to agricultural exports from the developing world?
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The Doha round started back in 2001, a journey that I hope will be completed in Hong Kong. But if it is really to alleviate the appalling disadvantages and problems faced by the developing world, a huge amount of work remains to be done. I would like to conclude with a brief example that is very topical. In 2001, the developing countries were promised special and differential treatment in the areas of public health and relevant intellectual property rights. The lack of clarification since 2001 in this area and in particular the failure to meet the deadlines that were accepted at that point of six months or slightly more means that we have reached a situation where, for example, if there was a flu pandemic in the developing world, countries in the developing world could, in theory, like ourselves or other countries in the developed world, overrule patent rights to manufacture the necessary drugs under compulsory licence, but only if they had the manufacturing capacity to do so.
</p>

<a name="51102-13_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>For example, a country such as Mozambique does not have such manufacturing capacity, so for it to issue a compulsory licence would be futile. It would need in some way to licence another country to act on its behalf as the manufacturer and at present it cannot do so. Will the Minister look at that issue urgently? The report asks the Government to use the remaining weeks of their presidency to make a difference at the United Nations and to advance the development agenda. I am sure that we all hope that that is indeed what will happen.

</p>

<a name="51102-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>This has been an excellent debate. I was particularly grateful for the very interesting organisational requirements for the UN enunciated by my noble friend Lady Falkner. That is a huge subject, which needs more discussion by experts in the future.

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I believe that the EU&#039;s role is improving in the UN. It is a considerable role already and needs to be much more cohesive and co-ordinated in the future.

grind those more narrowly based axed. That is a genuine position, which can easily continue. I hope so. And there is no reason why the recent arrival of the 10 new members will change that position.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The millennium summit was too ambitious in its coverage and suffered from the usual effect of looking much more interesting and compelling before it actually took place. I suppose that was inevitable. It was a long litany of desirable objectives and aspirations for a world where many countries are grappling with sincere and noble goals, including under-developed countries, where the danger is, as the Government have acknowledged, that implementation of reform measures is much harder than talking about them in such a large forum. The idea that all the millennium development goals will be reached in due time is a matter of doubt. On climate change, the crucial post-2012 obligations will, I hope, be dealt with decisively at the UN climate change conference in December, but there is an awful lot of work to be done, and talking, as we know, is easier than doing.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para3"></a>

<a name="51102-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The EU response has already been much more helpful and rapid than that of the United States to many of these things. If the Prime Minister continues to claim a special relationship with an increasingly ailing President Bush, he should, in the time available in the second term, at least make sure that the Americans respond much more energetically than so far demonstrated.

<a name="51102-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>The Government have also recognised the need to analyse the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism as well as the normal parts of the counter-terror strategy. That must include a coherent picture, description and recommendations about terrorism in uniform as well, whoever the perpetrators in different countries may be, in the future as in the past.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Will we also be able to see progress in reform of the UN Security Council, so long overdue but still as elusive as ever, due the entrenched positions of the privileged elite of a small number of leading member states? It was rather depressing to read the press in the UK and elsewhere after the millennium summit, which was described as talking rather than achieving much. According to the <i>Economist</i> in mid-September:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;Most countries put the blame on the United States, in the form of its abrasive new ambassador, John Bolton, for insisting at the end of August on hundreds of last-minute amendments and a line-by-line renegotiation of a text most others had thought was almost settled&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>According to the<i> </i>international section of the <i>Guardian</i> on 17 September, the only conclusion was &quot;low marks on the final scoreboard&quot;. On the same date, the <i>Guardian</i> leader said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;Not much can be said in praise of the UN world summit, which has ended with little more than a heavily spun restatement of its loftiest ambitions&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>These are the realities we all face, which is why the Minister has to convince the House that action will be taken. The <i>Independent</i> said in its leading article on the same date:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;Mr Blair has spent much of this past week attempting to chivvy the UN summit in New York into accepting a universal definition of terrorism. In this he has failed. The motion was rejected by the UN General Assembly&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>One can understand the reasons why.

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="51102-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   My Lords, I do not believe that that last statement is accurate. The outcome document states that a comprehensive convention on terrorism, which would include a definition, should be agreed during the 60th General Assembly, which runs until next September. Therefore, it is not right to say that it has failed. It is conceivable that it will fail, but it has not done so yet. That throws light on some of the other press cuttings that the noble Lord mentioned. One cannot treat press cuttings as facts.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="51102-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dykes: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is entitled to his opinion and I am certainly entitled to mine. A lot of people regarded the whole exercise of the terrorism examination as extremely disappointing and it is sad that he views it as an official function rather than from a more practical standpoint about the action that is going to be taken. It is perfectly valid to quote from the press, because it is interesting to see how the press considered the summit.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>On 17 September, the <i>Times</i> referred to the Prime Minister&#039;s love-in with General Musharraf of Pakistan:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;But General Musharraf is also a military ruler who has broken his own promises about stepping down as head of the army, and choked off the mainstream political parties&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and others will perhaps note that I am referring to the reality that many members of the General Assembly feel dismayed about the future of the UN unless more of a balance is injected into its bodies and procedures and the United Nations Security Council is reformed. In that sense, the millennium review has let people down. Perhaps one was unwisely expecting too much. Many things were started in an incipient way, which is a good thing. However, it is much more difficult to reach conclusions than to start things off.

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Iran was mentioned in the context of the UN. The UN Security Council will have a testing time deciding what to do with reference to the EU-3 and so forth at further stages.

and violent piece of nonsense and has been happily buried in a veritable avalanche of worldwide condemnation, including from the UN Secretary-General, the Palestinian Authority and others. I was glad to see a strong rebuke from Muhammad Khatami, the former president of Iran, of what the new Iranian president said.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>I speak as a long-standing friend of Israel. I have been heavily involved with Israel for many years. It is a remarkable country. It is a country that is brave and courageous enough to overcome such spurious and rather foolish sounding threats. Of course, there have been attempts by moderate Iranians to go back on what the president said in foolish outbursts on two occasions.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>Israel is a remarkable and courageous country, but it remains the unbeatable military power in the whole zone. That is a solid fact that no amount of hysterical and blustering rhetoric from Iranian racialists such as this new president can gainsay. The reality is that none of this imposes other than a strong obligation on the Sharon-led coalition at long last to commence negotiations with the administration of President Abu Mazen. I am entitled to mention this because the subject came up at the summit in General Assembly speeches and in the corridors and <i>Derri&#232;re les coulisses</i>. It is time for the stalling to stop.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The leading members of the advanced world in the Security Council have long let down the rest of the UN with their disregard for the needs of the third world in basic political terms and their predilection for regarding the UN Security Council at a sort of private estate for their own pattern of dominance. That happened in the beginning of the UN and has continued for many years since. It must change in the future for the General Assembly members, or those rising larger countries&#151;Brazil was mentioned and there are others, such as India and Pakistan&#151;will lose heart about the validity of a modern version of the UN for the future.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>The 34 vetoes that have been exercised by the Americans to stop various Israeli governments behaving more fairly towards Palestine according to international law after nearly 40 years of occupation, is the case in point but there are many others. This pattern of misuse of the UN by the United States and other powers has not stopped since the end of the Cold War. Many active members of the General Assembly feel angry and frustrated, and the West must recognise the need to build a modern 21st century UN that acts for all the members, not just the rich club.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>Because of the positive influence of the European Union, attitudes are at last changing, and the growth of the Asian nations, such as India, China, Indonesia and Japan as world and involved powers at long last&#151;it has taken a long time indeed&#151;will help to right that overdue unfairness and imbalance. The EU has pledged to double aid to the third world, and various other things will happen from now on to give us more cause for hope.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>While I am sceptical about the summit and its detail&#151;I hope that the Minister will reassure us and make us feel more cheerful about what will be done&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>

huge questions remain. There is the peacebuilding commission, the construction of the definition of terrorism in the modern context on a balanced basis, and other matters. Non-proliferation has been referred to, as has the complicated reform of the Security Council, conditionality and the G8 initiatives. They need further monitoring and elucidation by the House.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>World agricultural reforms have been referred to in the debate, and we can take some pleasure from the reality that the common agricultural policy, despite being expensive and old-fashioned, and needing further reform beyond the insipid reforms that have been launched in recent years, is far from being the most expensive of the main farm support systems in the world. The US is much more expensive for a much smaller number of farmers. Japan is similar in its effect. The EU has a better record in taking in ACP food product and staple imports than do some other advanced countries.
</p>

<a name="51102-14_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>There is a balance in the arguments, but more needs to be done. I hope that the House, the Government and, indeed, the UN will not be complacent.

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>The eight goals range from halving extreme poverty to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education&#151;all by the target date of 2015. The UN MDG website states:


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;They have galvanized unprecedented efforts to meet the needs of the world&#039;s poorest&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>In contrast the millennium review summit 2005 has been described as a &quot;summit of hypocrites&quot;&#151;just another talking shop with little progress on the MDGs.

</p>

<a name="51102-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>Does the noble Baroness believe that the millennium development goals can be met by 2015? The UN report, <i>Investing in Development,</i> points out that sub-Saharan Africa, for example, is not on track to meet all millennium development goals. It has the highest rate of under-nourishment with one-third of the population below the minimum level of dietary energy consumption. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest primary enrolment rates of all regions. Despite recent progress, gender disparity at the primary level is the lowest of all regions.

<a name="51102-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>Meanwhile, west Asia, a region that includes many countries typically classified as part of the Middle East, is reportedly not on track for the majority of the goals. Both income poverty and hunger are increasing, and progress toward gender equality has been slow. Primary enrolments increased by only 2 per cent between 1990 and 2001, and mortality rates in under-fives per 1,000 live births in the same period. Maternal mortality remains high and infectious diseases such as TB are still a threat.

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>Three years ago, to meet the millennium development goals on water and sanitation, we should have been spending $180 billion a year on all water projects, but we were spending only $80 billion. What reforms have been made to meet the goals? How will Her Majesty&#039;s Government ensure their effectiveness? Does the Minister agree with the committee&#039;s view that the EU,

<a name="51102-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>If so, how does that square with the FCO&#039;s commitment, of which we heard at Question Time today, to close various embassies around the world by the end of next year?
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>We welcome the EU&#039;s commitment to increase aid, and we are glad that the Government agree that the commitment must be monitored in light of doubts expressed on whether all member states will be able to deliver the sums pledged. Could the Minister explain in a little more detail whether further action will be taken or penalties imposed, beyond monitoring, if a member state is found to be failing consistently to increase its aid package?
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>Despite the increase in aid, I feel that we should question whether more aid is always the answer to poverty reduction and economic development. Nigeria is an example of a country in which, despite swallowing up billions of pounds in aid and oil revenues, living standards have actually fallen over the past two decades. There are significant examples of countries in which aid does not necessarily equal development. It may actually prevent it by providing &quot;easy money&quot; aid flows, which then remove the incentives to reform and grass roots enterprise. What steps are Her Majesty&#039;s Government taking to investigate the waste element of UK and European aid? Will the Government ensure that more is filtered through NGOs to target projects rather than to governments who fail to be transparent and accountable? It is vital that we have joined-up governance and government on issues such as trade, aid and security to help to break the cycle of poverty rather than unwittingly add to it.

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, in his evidence to the committee, and as a member of the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, suggested that the EU&#039;s position at the UN has changed. That is partly due to significant financial contribution to the institution. Secondly, the common foreign and security policy has meant that the EU has become more cohesive and able to deliver according to the <br>&nbsp;<br>

UN&#039;s needs. Does the Minister agree that the EU will have a real influence on whether the UN will succeed or fail in the current era?
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para11"></a>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>We believe that the UN does have a role to play in today&#039;s world, the fight against poverty and security, and within that the EU has an important role. Poverty and security are interlinked but we must be careful not to lose sight of one by concentrating too much on the other. Words are not enough; we need action, efficiency rather than bureaucracy, and transparent, accountable governance at all national and international levels.

<a name="51102-15_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to this important debate on the European Union&#039;s role at the millennium review summit. I am also extremely grateful for the work of the noble Lords of Sub-Committee C, notably their excellent chair, the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, on their comprehensive report. As usual, it is of the highest standard.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>As this House will be aware, the Government and the European Union are deeply committed to the United Nations. Since the UN Secretary-General announced his intention to take forward his bold and ambitious reform agenda for the UN by setting up the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, of which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, was a member, we have underlined at every opportunity our strong support for a more effective United Nations, better able to tackle the interrelated challenges of development, security and human rights, underpinned by an efficient UN Secretariat. That remains the case today.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>That is precisely why the Government and the European Union worked tirelessly for a successful outcome at the UN world summit in September. The reforms agreed, enshrined in the summit&#039;s so-called &quot;outcome document&quot;, will set the agenda of the United Nations for years to come. They are a set of essential reforms and commitments that will enable the UN to be better equipped to tackle the challenges faced by the modern world. As the noble Lord, Lord Watson, suggested, this debate is an excellent opportunity to draw attention to the vital role of the EU within the United Nations.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Holding the EU presidency, the UK plays an important role in the often difficult negotiations on the summit outcome document. Gaining consensus agreement on such a broad agenda was always going to be a difficult objective, reflecting the diversity of the UN&#039;s membership. But it is to the credit of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_262"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 262</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

members of the United Nations, with the European Union at the fore, that they were able to rise to the challenge and agree on such an extensive set of reforms.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The bar was set very high. The reports of the high-level panel, Jeffrey Sachs&#039; UN Millennium Project, and Kofi Annan&#039;s own report <i>In Larger Freedom</i> demonstrated one inescapable truth: until the international community takes decisive action to address with urgency poverty, disease, environmental degradation and social injustice, we will not be to achieve sustainable conflict resolution and secure global peace and security. Without peace and security, we cannot tackle development&#151;it is as simple as that. All of these are not possible without universal respect for human rights and the rule of law.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>History has shown that too often the international community has responded to these challenges with dissent and lethargy, driven by conflicting priorities. However, the summit has shown that the international community is at its most powerful and effective when it operates with unity and energy, driven by common goals and purpose. The summit secured firm commitments from both donor and developing countries on development, with several important Gleneagles outcomes endorsed and new EU commitments welcomed by the broader UN membership. These included the need to accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals and to address the special needs of Africa. As the noble Lord, Lord Astor, suggested, people say that it will be extremely difficult for us to reach the millennium development goals by 2015. However, that is what we shall strive to do. Those are our goals and we have to meet them, if at all possible. Together, I hope, we can do it.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>We certainly welcome the mandate given to the Secretary-General to address longer-term reform of the UN development architecture and we hope that this will result in more effective uses of the wealth of expertise, experience and resources within the UN system. We also support the clear commitment made to improving the timeliness and predictability of humanitarian funding. Humanitarian funding is one of the key plinths of our development policy, together with trade and the other part of the triangle.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>Sustainable development was recognised as a key element of the overarching framework of the UN&#039;s activities and was integrated throughout the development section of the outcome document, while the UN reform section underlined the need for a more coherent institutional framework for environmental activities in the UN system. Countries at the UN summit committed to move forward the global discussion on long-term co-operative action to address climate change and stressed the importance of the UN climate change conference to be held in Montreal later this month. Yesterday, the first meeting of the dialogue on climate change took place in London.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>At the EU Environment Council on 17 October, the EU agreed its negotiating strategy for the conference in Montreal. Its priority is to get the Kyoto Protocol <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_263"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 263</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

off to a good start and to ensure that it operates efficiently. The EU confirmed its determination to meet its commitments under the UN Framework Convention and Protocol, including in relation to funding to assist developing countries. The EU also set an objective to launch discussions on a process to determine further action after the Kyoto Protocol&#039;s first commitment period.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The summit&#039;s endorsement of the responsibility to protect underlined the obligation on states to protect their own populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. Importantly, for the first time, UN member states also acknowledged that the international community should act&#151;through the Security Council&#151;if governments fail to protect their populations from these terrible atrocities.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>The summit&#039;s agreement to create by the end of this year a new peacebuilding commission will close an institutional gap in the UN&#039;s conflict architecture and will assist countries emerging from conflict. As the holder of the EU presidency, we are working hard to achieve the establishment of the new body by 31 December of this year. There has been progress, including on arrangements for involving the affected countries in the work of the commission. Of course, there remains the need to find satisfactory conclusions on other practical issues, including on how the commission will operate. However, I understand that it is hoped that agreement will be reached in New York on countries being able to self-nominate. If that happens, clearly the peacebuilding commission could help countries to avoid slipping into conflict. The Government see an obvious need for a clear and agreed role for the United Nations Security Council in the peacebuilding commission, and this matter is currently under discussion.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>We have strongly welcomed the agreement to establish a new human rights council to replace the much-maligned Commission on Human Rights. Noble Lords are right when they say that the current commission is both inefficient and much discredited. But we are working hard with EU partners and the wider membership to settle the main elements of the council by the end of December so that the council can start its work as soon as possible in 2006. Human rights must have their proper place within the UN system, and that is right at the heart, or centre, of the UN system.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I agree that preferably the human rights council should be smaller than the current commission. Obviously that is a very difficult matter for negotiation, but negotiations will continue. Consultations on the council have begun in earnest. The President of the General Assembly, Mr Eliasson, is holding four rounds of open consultation with states in October and November. He is aiming to produce a draft text in the second half of November and to begin detailed negotiations on 28 November with a view to reaching agreement on the main points by the end of the year. I consider that to be very good news for the global system of governance and human rights.

</p>

<a name="51102-15_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>In respect of terrorism, I was rather astounded to hear the quotation cited by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, and to hear that he believed everything that he had read in the newspapers. I have participated with him in many debates on the European Union in which we have both urged noble Lords not to believe everything they read about the EU in the newspapers. I respectfully suggest to him that perhaps he should not believe everything that he reads about terrorism and the United Nations.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>Gaining an unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and, separately, unanimous adoption by the Security Council of the UK&#039;s Security Council resolution to prohibit by law incitement to terrorism were useful steps forward. Noble Lords will be glad to know that discussions on the comprehensive convention on international terrorism are ongoing, with the UK presidency participating actively. We welcome the commitment of world leaders at the summit to work to conclude this convention during the current session of the General Assembly, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, suggested.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, about the OIC, the UK and other EU members have been lobbying the OIC on its proposed amendment to the comprehensive convention. The OIC proposal concerns foreign occupation and raises concerns with several delegations that an exception for the definition of terrorism is being sought, but the UK and other delegations are working hard to find a solution.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>Although the primary focus from the perspective of disarmament and non-proliferation this year was rightly the NPT review conference, its disappointing outcome gave us added incentive to make strenuous efforts to remedy that at the UN world summit in September. The Foreign Secretary was pleased to take part in the initiative promoted by his then Norwegian colleague designed to generate broad support for a forward-looking non-proliferation agenda. That is why, as presidency of the European Union, we also worked hard to secure European support for strong and meaningful commitments on non-proliferation and disarmament. From discussion with the new Foreign Minister of Norway last week, I understand that the initiative started by his colleague will continue. It is of course disappointing that the summit was unable to agree on commitments to disarmament and non-proliferation. However, we remain completely committed to exploring ways to achieve progress and to strengthen the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>The IAEA general conference last month demonstrated an especially good spirit of co-operation and determination among states to strengthen non-proliferation and address other issues, such as the peaceful use of nuclear technology. Those are important building blocks. The UN First Committee, presently in session, the UNSCR 1540 Committee and the G8 global partnership are all fora in which we are actively participating and we continue to work hard to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_265"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column 265</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

bring into force the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to begin negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>All those reforms were underpinned by proposals for reform of the UN Secretariat. The world summit recognised that the organisation needs reinvigorating to enable the UN to deliver the challenging mandate that it has been set. That will require an efficient and effective secretariat. Failure to reprioritise activity and modernise working methods risks undermining the wider reforms that the summit set in train.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>Some noble Lords have suggested that reform of the secretariat should be a secondary issue, but the Government&#039;s view is that reform of the secretariat is crucial to the implementation of the new UN agenda. We strongly endorse the reforms under way and urge the Secretary-General to be bold in the exercise of his existing mandate. Efforts already under way to strengthen accountability through improved oversight and performance management are welcome. Further reports from the Secretary-General are expected to make proposals for overhaul of financial and human resource regulations that will improve flexibility and transparency in decision-making at the UN. The EU will continue to work closely with the Secretary-General to deliver the management reforms that world leaders have endorsed.
</p>

<a name="51102-15_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>The lack of agreement that has been apparent for reform of the UN structure reflects the diverse and strong opinions within the UN system. The UK Government support reform of the UN Security Council, and its expansion to include Germany. We also support the extension of the Council to Japan, India and Brazil, as well as permanent African representation. My noble friend Lord Lea suggested that there are lessons to be learnt from past failures.

<a name="51102-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Watson of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. I thank her for that answer, but can she also deal with the related question of Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#039;s view of the EU at some point being permanently represented on the UN Security Council?
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="51102-16_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, the UN Charter, as it stands, would not allow membership of the EU. I believe that we should therefore leave that question for another day.
</p>

<a name="51102-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>My noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall suggested that we should be looking at new ways to deal more effectively with multilateralism and learn from the lessons of the past. He suggested that there should perhaps be a body set up under the UK presidency. It is an interesting idea, which I shall certainly take to my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary. However, I think that there are other priorities in the six remaining weeks of the UK presidency. Clearly, however, there are lessons to be learnt.
</p>

<a name="51102-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>Members of the committee have received what I believe to be an excellent policy paper on conditionality, an issue which the noble Lord also <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_266"></a>

raised. We believe that donor programmes must support developing countries&#039; own priorities. The UK programmes respect this, so long as recipients are committed to sound financial management, human rights and reducing poverty.
</p>

<a name="51102-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond, raised many important and difficult issues. Many noble Lords have referred to the amount of money paid by the EU to the UN&#151;38 per cent. The noble Lord asked if our role in the EU is proportionate to our budgetary contribution. The Government believe that it is, absolutely. The EU is a key partner with the UN in a number of fora. For example, there is EU financing for peacekeeping missions, and we played a crucial role in the summit negotiations and implementation. So we are a key player, and it is therefore beholden on us to make a key contribution.
</p>

<a name="51102-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond, will know, the UK has been at the forefront of CAP negotiations in Doha, arguing for the removal of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies, recognising their negative impact on developing countries. It would not be appropriate for me to say at the Dispatch Box how much we think subsidies should or should not be. That could inflame discussions that Peter Mandelson is involved in. However, the UK is certainly pushing for an agreement that will benefit developing countries.
</p>

<a name="51102-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>The noble Lord also referred to pharmaceutical companies in Mozambique. I am afraid that I do not know the answer to the matter that he raised, but I shall certainly pursue it.
</p>

<a name="51102-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>Although the summit endorsed all the G8 achievements of 2005, particularly on making faster progress towards the MDGs and recognition of the special needs of Africa, some have expressed disappointment and frustration at the results of the world summit. I am delighted, however, that so many noble Lords today clearly understand that real progress took place. I endorse the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick. I agree that we should give two cheers for the results of the summit, if not three.
</p>

<a name="51102-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Many felt that the commitments made did not go far enough. In some cases, we share their disappointment. Let us be realistic, however. It is unlikely that, in any summit involving 191 nations, there would be unanimity on the range of issues under discussion. Of course, we wanted the summit to go further in some areas, but if the reforms that we agreed are really implemented&#151;as we are working hard to achieve&#151;the Government are confident that the summit will represent a landmark moment for the United Nations.
</p>

<a name="51102-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, asked whether reform would happen. Clearly, the success of the reforms depends on the political will of the member states. That will is certainly here in the Government, and is shared by other governments within the EU. We are committed to playing an active role in ensuring that the reforms agreed are fully and urgently implemented. This represents a vital part of the EU&#039;s goal of an international order based on effective multilateralism and the rule of law.

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>Only last week, our ambassadors, acting as the EU presidency, lobbied in all African posts to encourage visible and positive African positions in the ongoing implementation discussions in New York. These outreach efforts will continue as negotiations in New York progress. As the Prime Minister said in New York, if we start implementing urgently the reforms agreed on doubling aid, opening up trade, debt relief, HIV/AIDS, malaria, conflict prevention and stopping genocide, we would have a more modern democracy, less oppression, more freedom, less terrorism, more growth and less poverty. We do not live in an ideal world but we are striving to ensure that the UN can make the world a better place, and we will continue to do so. The results of the summit were exceptionally successful for 191 nations working together in partnership.

It is clear from the debate that there are still issues outstanding: the peacekeeping commission, the human rights commission, the definition of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation and the reform of the administration. In many ways, this is the start of the story rather than the end. The debate has covered a wide range of subjects. Many of the issues raised could themselves have formed the subject of a debate, whether it be the WTO round or the memorandum circulated on conditionality&#151;I agree with the Minister, although I <br>&nbsp;<br>

did not refer to it in the introduction to my report&#151;to say nothing of whether the European Union should have membership of the Security Council.
</p>

<a name="51102-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>However, the report was on the EU&#039;s role at the millennium review summit. It is clear from this debate and the report that the EU took a co-ordinated approach. Very detailed work was done over a long period so that the June European Council conclusions could be produced in preparation for the summit. The co-ordinated approach continued. It is interesting to note that the Foreign Secretary was able to make a statement to the General Assembly on behalf of the 25 members of the European Union, the acceding countries of Bulgaria and Romania, the then candidate countries of Turkey and Croatia, the countries of the stabilisation association process and potential candidates Bosnia-Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, as well as Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. They all aligned themselves with that statement. That is quite an impressive achievement for the European Union.

In speaking to lead Amendment No. 77A, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, which was grouped with other amendments relating to the National Trust, I said that the powers in the Bill to amend local Acts by order would be,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;exercised rarely and cautiously, in consultation with the bodies whose interests are affected and subject to parliamentary scrutiny&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 1/11/05; col. GC 38.]</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>That was not quite correct. It is certainly the case that orders under Clause 34&#151;consequential provision on establishment of commons associations&#151;and Clause 42&#151;supplementary provision about works in local Acts&#151;are subject to the negative resolution procedure in both Houses. Orders under Clause 16, for the deregistration and exchange of land, are purely administrative orders relating to particular local schemes and are therefore not subject to parliamentary oversight. It is our intention, however, that orders under all those clauses will be open to public consultation.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>The noble Lord said: I want to raise two points with my noble friend. First, on timing, I understand that there is much concern in some commons registration authorities about an open-ended time period for a transitional period. They need to know what kind of time period is envisaged and whether we shall have a clear indication of how that will work. Secondly, on correction of registers, I note that the Bill as drafted states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;in the case of a right of common attached to land, the apportionment or severance of the right&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>I return to the question that I raised earlier in Committee. Does that include rights attached to a farm business tenancy where those rights are apportioned from the dominant tenement into the tenancy? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51102-17_spnew6"></a><b> The Duke of Montrose: </b>   I wish to speak to Amendment No. 114 in this group. Presumably the regulations will lay down the date by which all applications have to be received by CRAs. At some time, will the Government indemnify the commons registration authorities against claims of maladministration should they fail to deal with applications made within the time allowed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="51102-17_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   Amendment No. 111 stands in my name. The amendment inquires of the Minister whether the words &quot;regulations may&quot; mean that it is simply permissive for the authorities to do this if they want. I am not a big fan of regulations, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC69"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC69</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as the Minister will know&#151;we prefer provisions to be on the face of the Bill where possible&#151;but this is an example where regulations will be essential. If we are to have them, it would have been more appropriate to have said what regulations must, in that case, deal with.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="51102-17_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Amendment No. 110 removes the powers in Schedule 2 for regulations to make provision for a transitional period to enable the updating of the commons registers, but my noble friend wants the answer to two questions. His is very much a probing amendment. I know that he will forgive me if I come back to him in due course.
</p>

<a name="51102-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Amendment No. 114 removes paragraph 3 of Schedule 2, which provides for the extinguishment of rights of common which remain unregistered at the conclusion of the transitional period. Amendment No. 114 would cause any unregistered but otherwise valid rights to remain in existence but off the registers.
</p>

<a name="51102-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>Our aim is to ensure that the commons registers are updated to reflect the many events which have taken place since they were drawn up in the late 1960s, but which were not reflected in amendments to the register. During the transitional period, people will have an opportunity to apply to register events which affect the interests in the registers. Indeed, we hope and expect that they will pursue any necessary amendments.
</p>

<a name="51102-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>But there must be a sanction&#151;I believe he was addressing the Committee on this issue&#151;to be applied where the amendments are not made, and paragraph 3 therefore provides that rights which exist, but are unregistered at the cut-off date, will be extinguished. In the same way, rights which were previously extinguished but remain registered at the cut-off date will be revived, by virtue of Clause 17.
</p>

<a name="51102-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The main effect of paragraph 3 will be to extinguish any right which has been created over land since 1970, but which is left unregistered. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are very few such rights. The most likely source is where land has been acquired by compulsory purchase, and substitute land given in exchange: it will be essential that the rights vested in the exchange land are registered, if they are not to be extinguished.
</p>

<a name="51102-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>There is provision in paragraph 4 of the schedule for regulations to enable qualifying amendments to be made after the cut-off date, but we expect that such regulations would permit an amendment only if it were fair&#151;I use that word &quot;fair&quot; with some hesitation&#151;having regard to the effect which it would have on other interests in the right or land; so an out-of-time amendment would be discretionary, not an entitlement. Therefore, the amendment would remove the sanctions that are intended to help ensure engagement by stakeholders in the whole review process and leave people with no reason to bother applying for amendments to the register. That of course would mean that we would be unable to achieve our objective of current, up-to-date registers which are fit for purpose.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC70"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC70</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51102-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Amendment No. 111 would require the Secretary of State to make regulations regarding the registration during the transitional period of qualifying events, whereas at present that power is discretionary. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that it will be very necessary to make regulations to set out a procedure for updating the commons registers under Schedule 2. It would be impossible to achieve our objective of an up-to-date register without a period of review during which qualifying events are captured in the registers. The amendment is unnecessary&#151;I know that the noble Baroness is probing us on this&#151;because it is inconceivable that the Secretary of State or the National Assembly will not make regulations.
</p>

<a name="51102-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>However, the noble Baroness will be aware that we seek some flexibility in the way in which the transitional period is implemented in different areas, and the imposition of the word &quot;shall&quot; could constrain that flexibility. At the moment, paragraph 2 ensures that we may make provision for registers to be amended in consequence of qualifying events, so that we could in principle make regulations for some qualifying events but not others. If we change &quot;may&quot; to &quot;must&quot; we will lose that flexibility. The possibility of registration of all &quot;qualifying events&quot; would no longer be a concession, but a right, and we would have to make regulations to cater for all qualifying events.
</p>

<a name="51102-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Last but certainly not least, I turn to Amendment No. 110, which has been moved by my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel. As regards the timing issue and transitional arrangements, my answer is as follows. I said yesterday in debate on Amendment No. 89 that we envisage a period of three years or more for the transitional period in any particular area, although that period may be phased in in its implementation across the country. I know that that is a slightly vague answer to my noble friend&#039;s question, but three years is the period.
</p>

<a name="51102-17_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>My noble friend asked a question about rights attached to farm business tenancies. It may be that neither I nor those advising me heard his question clearly. We may need to write with an answer. Indeed, my note says that we trust the noble Lord will forgive us. He has raised a very interesting point on the rights attached. We will write on that issue.

Lord Williams, about the timing, which we went into yesterday. The Minister has kindly given us a little more of an indication today than he was able to do yesterday. We would still like to see a keener indication in the Bill on what the timing will be.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;Conditions under subsection . . . may include conditions requiring the payment of a fee (which may be a fee determined by a commons registration authority)&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="51102-18_para6"></a>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Clause 10, &quot;Attachment&quot;, refers to the owner of the right applying to the commons registration authority. Clause 15, &quot;Deregistration and Exchange: applications&quot;, is the only clause where the application is not to be made to the commons registration authority. In this case, it has to be made to &quot;the appropriate national authority&quot;. Is that an oblique reference to a form of tax to be paid to the government by anyone wishing to swap one area of land for another? Or maybe I am reading in things that are not there. If it is the case, surely it should appear in Clause 15 as the other fee references appear in Clauses 19 and 20?
</p>

<a name="51102-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Finally, the amendment of the register is surely the activity that should attract the fee, in which case it would be entirely appropriate for that fee to be paid to the commons registration authority. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51102-18_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   The amendment would mean that only commons registration authorities could be given a power to set their own fees for applications. Part 1 provides for applications to be made for various purposes in order that the registers of common land and town and village greens are kept up to date and reflect changes to the matters registered. Although most such applications must be made to the commons registration authority, applications for deregistration and exchange of land under Clauses 15 and 16 must be made instead to the national authority&#151;the Secretary of State or the National Assembly.
</p>

<a name="51102-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Clause 23 provides for powers to regulate applications made to both the commons registration authority and the national authority. Thus, in subsection (2)(d), reference is made to the person to whom application is made, rather than to the commons registration authority. &quot;Person&quot; in that context means the registration authority, the Secretary of State or the National Assembly. In line with our policy to let local authorities get on with managing their own affairs, the powers in subsection (2)(d) include the possibility of enabling the registration authority to set its own fees, although we expect regulations to require fees to be set no higher than the cost of recovery. In relation to applications to the national authority, there would be no point in regulations enabling the national authority to set its own fee, because the regulations are actually made by that national authority.
</p>

<a name="51102-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>The amendment does not in practice constrain any powers to make regulations, but does introduce a modest grammatical difficulty into the text. That is because the provision would refer to the fee being determined by the commons registration authority to which the application is made, whereas the Secretary of State or the Assembly may be the recipient of the application.

Yesterday, she was concerned that Clauses 15 and 16 would reduce the ability of landowners to apply for exchanges in private interest. Surely she would expect such applications to be paid for by the applicant rather than publicly. We do not expect that fees should be payable for applications in the public interest, such as applications to register greens. Where the benefit from an application would be purely private, we envisage an appropriate fee being payable. I hope that I have answered the points raised.

<p><a name="st_31"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 122A, I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 122B and 123A.

<a name="51102-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>On Tuesday of last week the Minister said that,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Therefore, I could be forgiven for expecting some sympathy in tabling these amendments which would ensure that the appropriate national authority makes regulations requiring commons registration authorities to maintain commons registers in an electronic form. At a time of great technical advancement, coupled with the transparency of the Government, it should be possible that the information held in the register is in an electronic form.

</p>

<a name="51102-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Currently, subsection (1) provides that the regulations may relate to part of a register. For example, regulations may provide only for maps contained in a register to be kept in an electronic form.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Subsection (3) enables regulations to make provisions as to the process of conversion of a register or part of a register into an electronic form. Again, these amendments would ensure that all registers are kept in an electronic form.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>These amendments would also ensure that all parts of the register, and not, for example, only maps, are held in an electronic form.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The Government encountered many problems in the translation of information under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 into electronic format. Often problems arose turning old, relatively small scale Ordnance Survey maps into a modern electronic mapping database. Will the noble Lord give us comfort that no such problems are expected to be encountered in this Bill? Can he give us comfort that the register will be freely available on the Internet? Finally, can he give some reassurance that adequate funding will be made available to the appropriate authorities under the Bill to ensure proper maintenance of the registration system? I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="51102-19_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I speak to Amendment No. 123, which is in this group. I should like clarification on this matter. I accept that the part of the regulations I am seeking to remove says &quot;may&quot; and that it makes provision regarding the process of converting the register. However, is this the only Bill&#151;or is it becoming a recurrent event&#151;where the process is defined on the face of the legislation? It seems an unusual step. I am sure that we all recognise and accept that many of our records will be moved on to electronic format, but I have not seen this sort of provision in previous legislation, stating that regulation &quot;may&quot; define it.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Page 28 of the Explanatory Notes refers to the digitisation of maps for the CROW Act and to the difficulties in transferring the information from old maps. If the Government intend simply to build on the experience gained from the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales, the use of the word &quot;process&quot; may be too wide. Can the Minister also tell me which part of the Government will be drawing up these regulations and under whose remit it will fall? Does it include anything that goes beyond the description of process included in this part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="51102-19_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I speak to Amendment No. 124, which is in this group. I draw the Committee&#039;s attention to the difficulties with electronic registers of maps. Conversations that I have had, particularly with commoners&#039; associations, have revealed that maps are not aligned with electronic maps such as those of common land made by the CCW in Wales. I think the Committee will agree on the need to ensure that maps are aligned and coterminous with registers that reflect information on the ground. The 1904 edition of the register of common land maps, for example, is often <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

found in a farm house. Something has to be done about the situation. It is clearly desirable that electronic information is kept but there is a lot of tradition in the countryside. Although commons registration authorities are often up to speed electronically, commons associations are not. Surely a dispute or discussion must be based on the same information and the same map. That really needs to be sorted out.

</p>

<a name="51102-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I attended a meeting of commoners in a region called Tawe Uchaf which is at the top end of the Swansea valley. Some 85 commoners came to the meeting which had been called by the CCW and the national park to discuss the mapping done as a result of the CROW Act. The national park representative said, &quot;Of course you can find all the information on our website&quot;. I stopped him in his tracks and took a straw poll of the commoners. As I suspected, only six of the 85 had a computer or access to one. The situation has improved in the past three years. Having been involved in lecturing younger farmers, I know that they are up to speed. However, we must remember that many of those about whom we are talking have an average age between 55 and 60 and there is a communications problem that we need to sort out.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>So although it is desirable to make the whole procedure electronic, we also need standardisation, particularly in the mapping of the information dealt with in this amendment. The amendment seeks to put that right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="51102-19_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   We certainly have some sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, and other noble Lords regarding Clause 24. A useful debate can be held on that clause. It enables the statutory registers of common land and town or village greens to be converted to an electronic form.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Perhaps I can deal first with Amendment No. 123, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. It would remove the power for regulations to prescribe the conversion process, but it is clearly a probing amendment. We sense that there is widespread support from registration authorities for powers to enable them to hold their registers in an electronic form. But the process of converting the registers to an electronic form, and particularly translating the often ancient register maps into modern digitised mapping, will not be entirely straightforward. I do not expect that the Committee would expect me to say anything else. Many register maps are based on the old Ordnance Survey county series maps. The maps are long out of date, and much of the work in plotting boundaries on the maps was undertaken to an unsatisfactory standard.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>So regulations under subsection (3) of the clause may require authorities to consult on a provisional version of the register, which will enable people to comment in particular on the accuracy of the authority&#039;s digitisation of the register maps. We consider it essential that the public have an opportunity to be involved in the modernisation of the registers in this way, and indeed, for those with an interest in the land or rights affected, provision for consultation&#151;and if necessary a hearing&#151;may be the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC77"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC77</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

minimum required to ensure compatibility with human rights legislation. As I think I have already said, I cannot give an assurance to the effect that there will be no problems with digitising the register. The onus will be on the registration authorities to undertake that digitisation with due diligence. However, we shall certainly endeavour to ensure that they can learn any appropriate lessons from experience under the CROW Act.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 124, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey. As I understand it, his intention is that electronic registers should be consistent with the maps of open country and registered common land prepared by the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales under Part 1 of the CROW Act. Those maps were produced to show land to which people have a statutory right of access. The agency, and in Wales the council, were obliged to draw up maps which, so far as common land was concerned, effectively reproduced the registers of common land. The public had an opportunity to comment on the draft maps, and those with an interest in land affected could appeal against the provisional maps, but only on the question of whether the land was or was not registered common land. Such comments on and appeals against the maps are relevant only for the purposes of the new right of access, and have no bearing on what is shown in the commons registers.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>We believe that the agency&#039;s and council&#039;s statutory maps are very closely aligned with what is shown in the commons registration authority&#039;s registers, though there are temporal and technical difficulties which will account for some small differences; so much so that in promoting registration authorities&#039; use of the new power in this clause to convert to electronic registers, I know that the agency will be prepared to make its electronic mapping data available to local authorities to assist them in that task.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The noble Lord said that the website is sometimes inaccessible to some farmers. We do not think that his comments are entirely accurate because the CROW maps merely reproduce the boundaries of common land from the registers. They do not contain any of the textual data, for example, about rights of common. CROW access maps have been made available&#151;also in paper form&#151;to community councils in Wales and given to parish councils in England.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I turn to the questions of the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, who opened the debate. Amendment No. 122A would require the Secretary of State to make regulations under Clause 24 enabling the conversion of commons registers to an electronic form. We very much share the noble Lord&#039;s ambitions that commons registration authorities are able to convert their statutory registers to an electronic form. At present, registration authorities must keep their statutory registers in a paper form, although some keep an electronic copy of all or part to improve data handling. Conversion of the registers to an electronic form would bring significant benefits to both authorities and users&#151;for example, electronic <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC78"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC78</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

registers offer a much enhanced capability for searching both the maps and textual registers, including online services.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Perhaps the only disagreement between the noble Lord and me, at least in this context, is whether we should be obliged to make regulations enabling all this to happen. The short answer is that we intend to make such regulations. Enabling e-government in this area is very much in line with our objectives, as I hope I said the other day. Such regulations may not be our top priority. We may well wish to commence Part 1 of the Bill in stages in different areas. I have previously spoken of that intention. We would like to see the new arrangements in Part 1 replace the outdated provisions in the 1965 Act reasonably quickly. We may also wish to give priority to the commencement of other parts of the Bill, so that we can get statutory commons associations up and running as quickly as possible.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>That does not mean that regulations about electronic registers will be left until last. I am sure that local authorities would not stand for that. We seek to retain some flexibility about the way the Bill is implemented, and to listen to what people have to say to us about how that is done. At the very least, it would look odd if we were using discretionary regulation-making powers elsewhere in the Bill, while failing to fulfil an obligation to make regulations under Clause 24. In those circumstances we might be open to challenge in the courts.
</p>

<a name="51102-19_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>The noble Lord asked about funding. Local authorities will be provided with funding from the Government for any new burdens, including those relating to improving the registers. The amount will be considered as part of any pilot programme we roll out and in association with the Local Government Association. He asked about registers being available on the Internet. Those are matters for the registration authorities to decide, but we would certainly encourage the widespread dissemination of registration data in that way. We do not envisage making it a requirement to be on the Internet in regulations. I hope that I have answered the points raised.
</p>

<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="51102-20_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   I thank the Minister for a very sympathetic answer. I am delighted to hear that funding will follow this possible requirement. I shall go away and look at what he said. Perhaps I will be brave enough to try to encourage him to go a little further forward, because to my mind it logically follows that if funding is available, then the process should be carried out, even though it might be over a wide timescale. In the back of my mind I have a picture of some people who use the commons being unable to get the information for one reason or another&#151;perhaps because an association or a local authority is making life a bit difficult. The fact that this information &quot;shall&quot; be put on the register will override that problem. People in Radnorshire, such as the noble Lord, Lord Williams, will be able to touch a button and get the information needed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
   &quot;COSTS UNDER PART 1

<br>
   Regulations may make provision as to the payment of costs which are incurred by any person or body under Part 1.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_42"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is concerned with costs&#151;a matter that was touched on in the previous amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, and referred to earlier by my noble friend Lord Livsey.
</p>

<a name="51102-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>In reply to the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, the Minister said that the Government will provide welcome funding. I believe that if a statutory duty is given to a local authority under a Bill such as this, it must provide the funding. I am sure that the noble Lord will elucidate on that shortly.
</p>

<a name="51102-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>I declare an interest. My husband is a Devon county councillor. There are a couple of issues regarding funding being provided on a pilot basis. Although local authorities, when planning for the future, may be assured of having funding to underpin this, on what basis will the funding be provided? Will it be provided on the area of the commons, on the complexity of the registrations they are required to deal with, or on the size of the population involved? One issue that stands out is that a lot of this common land&#151;very often with more complex problems&#151;is in local authority areas with sparse populations. As I am sure the Minister is aware, the issues of sparsity and the costs of service delivery in such areas is already a contentious issue to those of us who feel that sparsely populated areas have been dealt a raw deal by successive governments. So, it is not a party political point, but sparsely populated areas have always had a bad deal. I hope that this will not be another case where council tax payers in such areas will be expected to foot the bill for a national shortcoming, by which I mean the Commons Registration Act 1965.

</p>

<a name="51102-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Finally, on funding, what other bodies, agencies or NGOs might expect to receive costs that they may incur under Part 1 of the Bill? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="51102-20_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Walpole: </b>   I rise at last to say something on the Bill. I declare an interest as the owner of one end of a common, with the Bishop of Norwich owning the other end, which is an interesting situation in view of what was previously said about the Church Commissioners. I think he looks after it himself.
</p>

<a name="51102-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I am in favour of most of the Bill. In Norfolk we do not have many commons. They are small. Some are enthusiastically used and some have not been touched for 30 years. Quite apart from anything else, they need sorting out. I am quite sure that the registration last time went tolerably well. However, it did not update the record and did not ensure that it was known who the commoners were. This problem will now have to be picked up and it will have to be discovered who the commoners are. That will cost money. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, certainly put it extremely well by asking from which hat the money will come. That is important because of sparsity. My goodness, we do not have many and do not have a dense population anyway. We are mostly arable and are talking about entirely grazing commons.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="51102-20_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Amendment No. 125 gives us a chance to have some debate about costs. In general terms, we expect persons to meet their own costs in complying with the requirements of Part 1. Clause 23, which we have debated, confers powers to make regulations regarding fees payable on any application under Part 1, and our expectation is that the costs to registration authorities of applications to amend the registers in Clauses 6 to 12 will generally be defrayed by fees. Where a person objects to an application, he will need to sustain his objection at his own expense. There is no general provision in the Bill to enable an award of costs in those circumstances.
</p>

<a name="51102-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>However, exceptionally, paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 contains provision for an award of costs in relation to an application for rectification of mistakes in the registers under that schedule. That is because such cases are particularly likely to involve applications which involve the wider public interest&#151;either retaining land on the register or adding new land to the register. In such cases, we think it right that there be a reserve power to award costs where a party to an application behaves unreasonably, such as by sustaining an objection which has no basis in law, or by failing to disclose his case until the date of an inquiry. The Bill already makes adequate provision for costs to be awarded where that might be necessary.
</p>

<a name="51102-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Let me say a word or two more on costs in relation to questions asked. We recognise that some local authority areas will face a greater burden, at least initially&#151;an example is Cumbria, where there is more common land. We intend initially to target the funding to individual local authorities in recognition of that. Pilots will be targeted at first on dealing with the areas that have the most complex problems. We need to learn and properly assess the extent of the problem. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC81"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Funding costs have been identified in the regulatory impact assessment, which we will look at again in the normal way on Royal Assent, when full implementation is planned based on the relevant requirements in the then Act.
</p>

<a name="51102-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about costs for other organisations and bodies. We do not plan on providing funding for NGOs. We will look at how we encourage and facilitate the establishment of commons associations, and that may be by providing money. We expect Natural England, if and when it is created, to take a lead role in championing the cause of common land in England. That could include its funding appropriate bodies to promote the establishment of commons associations, for example. So far as amendments to the register are concerned, fees will also be necessary. We hope that those costs will be effectively self-financing. I hope that that answers most of the noble Baroness&#039;s questions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="51102-20_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I want to speak before the noble Baroness comes back on the matter. I am grateful to the Minister for going into it in some depth. He said that the Government would target the money to go to local authorities. Will it be ring-fenced, or will it simply go into the local authority&#039;s general pot? Will it be paid upfront or retrospectively? Obviously that has implications. Will the pilot schemes, about which he talked, be in an area such as Cumbria that has so many commons, or are the Government minded to pick an area that does not have so many? Will he pick an area, say, in Wales and some in England?
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="51102-20_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   I was interested to hear what my noble friend said about targeting. Will he confirm that any financial support that came to a local authority in Wales would come through the National Assembly rather than directly from central government? If that is the case, is he now committing the National Assembly for Wales equally to target Powys County Council, for instance, which has a major problem in costs?
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="51102-20_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I shall just add to what the noble Lord, Lord Williams, said. We have an area, in Powys, that is similar to Cumbria in size, and we only have one person who is administering full-time the whole of the commons registration authority. That person informs me that she has neither the human resources nor the financial resources to implement properly what the Government are proposing in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="51102-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I shall do my best to answer some of those questions. The noble Baroness asked about ring-fencing. We can provide funding for pilot programmes, which will initially be brought on, but later on we are not allowed to ring-fence because Government policy allows for flexibility for local authorities to spend as they want. It is too early to say which areas will be pilot areas, but that is a legitimate question. We might come back to it at some stage, although it may be after Royal Assent that we have a better idea about that.

<a name="51102-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>The answer to the Wales question reminds me of the issue that my noble friend raised yesterday, for which he is still owed an answer. I hope to give him that answer next Tuesday. His question was so important that we need at least a week to give him the proper answer. Funding in Wales is a matter for the National Assembly. It is up to the Assembly; it may wish to target funding or the roll-out of implementation, but the constitutional position is exactly as he said; it is a matter for the Assembly. I very much doubt whether anything that I said would influence things one way or the other.

<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="51102-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   Do I understand that if money is given to the council in Wales to change the register into electronic form, there is no assurance that the money will be used for that and it could go to some other project altogether?
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="51102-21_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   In general terms, the answer is no, there can be no assurance, particularly as far as devolution is concerned. As I understand it, the Assembly is entitled to spend its money in its own way, but we are getting into realms that I am not very sure of. That applies also in general terms to local government in England.

<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="51102-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I am confused by the answers to the pertinent questions put by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, but it may be that I have not understood them properly. We are talking about costs of registration. There was some discussion about setting up commons associations, but that is not in Part 1, and we are talking about Part 1 here.
</p>

<a name="51102-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>If some authorities will be targeted in the early stages for them to get their new registration arrangements set up and operating properly, where does that leave those that are not being targeted, which will have commons that need sorting out the same as the rest? How does the Minister square targeting authorities with saying that the money will come as part of the local authority direct support grant? As I understand it, the principles behind the revenue support grant have to be the same for all local authorities. You cannot discriminate within that, except in clearly defined ways that are laid out in the rules, which will be difficult to lay out in relation to targeting some commons registration authorities and not others.

While in general terms local authorities have a discretion to spend what money they get in the way they want, there are examples&#151;this is one of them&#151;under the CROW Act where funds are channelled for a relevant purpose&#151;no doubt the relevant purpose is named&#151;and would apply the provisions of Part 1 of the Bill.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>Page 14, line 13, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

&quot;(   )   In preparing a proposed order, the appropriate national authority shall have a presumption in favour of an association which would be responsible for all commons in a well-defined area.&quot;

<p><a name="st_57"></a>The noble Lord said: Members of the Committee who took part in the Second Reading debate may recall that there was some discussion about whether Parliament should or could give some indication to those seeking to set up the new commons associations; that is, the type of area which we would expect them to represent and to manage. In Part 2, we now turn to the whole issue of management. My amendment, which is in a sense a probing amendment, may be very simple, but it touches on an extremely important principle. I look forward very much to hearing what the Minister will say on that issue.
</p>

<a name="51102-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>I am indebted to Professor Ian Mercer, chairman of the Dartmoor Commoners Council, for some very wise advice. It will be recalled that the passage of the legislation which set up the Dartmoor Commoners Council has been to some extent seen as a precursor to the present legislation. I hope that the practical experience on Dartmoor will inform discussions on this Bill and that the department has taken proper account of that experience.
</p>

<a name="51102-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The experience to which Professor Mercer refers welcomes very much the general thrust of this part of the Bill. I am sure that the Minister takes comfort from that. But in his briefing to Members of the Committee Professor Mercer says in relation to the commons&#151;or, in his terms, the blocks of common land units that may be appropriate for an association&#151;that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;In this regard the viability of the proposed association will be paramount and two things have a profound effect on that viability: one is the size of the area for which the association is formed to which the number of its potential members is connected, and the other is the conditions attached to the money-raising by fees referred to in Clause 31&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC84"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC84</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51102-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>It would obviously be inappropriate at this stage to refer in detail to Clause 31, but Professor Mercer makes a very important point; namely, that an association should at least have a potential number of members large enough to mean that a fee related to stock numbers for which there is a right to graze is reasonable. Otherwise there will not be the viability or the economy of scale that is necessary to give that viability.
</p>

<a name="51102-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>Professor Mercer illustrates the point by referring to Dartmoor where there are 914 registrations for graziers and 445 non-graziers, which means that with comparatively modest fees that council is able to raise something in the region of &#163;50,000 per annum through those contributions. It is an extremely important point that if a new association is not resourced adequately to be able to cover its normal expenditures and to put something aside in a contingency fund, there will be major problems.
</p>

<a name="51102-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>For the record, it is interesting to note that the Dartmoor council is comprised of 20 elected commoners: five from each of the historic quarters; two commons owners; two members of the national park authority, and Dartmoor is unusual in that it is a national park in the main; one from the Duchy of Cornwall, which his a very important landowner in the south-west of England and in Cornwall; a vet; and two co-opted members, one of whom is currently the regional director of the National Farmers Union, and the other is the chairman, Professor Mercer. The point is that if we have too many commons associations made up of lots of small units spread over a big area, it will not be feasible for that level of expertise to be available on a regular basis to all those associations. Professor Mercer makes the point that there are also practical considerations such as the need for all contiguous commons and their commoners&#039; activities to be managed together.
</p>

<a name="51102-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>As I think I said at Second Reading, there is a balance to be struck, and I notice that the Minister is nodding. On Bodmin Moor, on the fringe of which I live, we have a different situation with a large number of smaller commons associations. They are very proud of the work that they have done over the years and are, I have to say, very disappointed that we did not manage, with the help of the Government, to get through the private Bill that would have given statutory force to their management of those commons. The commons associations are smaller and have fewer resources, but they have something that is equally important&#151;historic continuity and commitment. That is where the issue of balance comes in. We would dispel and disrupt the commitment, involvement and ownership of decisions by the associations at our peril.
</p>

<a name="51102-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I hope that this afternoon we can give some sort of lead, and if we cannot do so now, that we can do so on Report or at Third Reading. I hope that the Minister will be able to indicate where the Government think that the emphasis should be, whether it should be in terms of coordinating and bringing together some of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51102-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Williams of Elvel: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, for moving the amendment, but I am bound to say that I do not think it would work in Wales. We have a number of small commons and to instruct the National Assembly to have a presumption in favour of an association which would be responsible for all commons in a well-defined area would perhaps be asking the National Assembly to cross a bridge too far.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="51102-22_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Ullswater: </b>   I do not often find myself in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Williams, but on this occasion I do. It would be unwise to go down this route. Consultation in 2003 demonstrated that commons can vary in size and that the number of graziers can vary considerably. That was understood in what the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said. For instance, in Cumbria there are 630 registered commons ranging in size from less than half an acre to well over 3,000 acres. There are more than 40 commons of more than 1,000 acres, and where commons adjoin the area is even larger.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>In order to get the best results, it is important to get people to work together and not to put them in competition. Those with few rights on one common in a particular area would be disadvantaged by this amendment. Local feelings and sensibilities can run high about these matters and the result would not be in the best interests of the community in general.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The Bill creates an enabling power with a duty to publish the draft orders recognising the diversity of commons and their use and management. I believe that it would be wrong to put in the Bill such an instruction that constrains the national authority at the outset of the process.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The Minister helpfully distributed two drafts of statutory instruments that the Secretary of State might make. The first is a draft standard constitution for a commons association, which would be suitable for one common or more. The second is an establishment order, which includes in it three commons working together. That demonstrates the right approach and shows the flexibility of the system proposed by the Government.

We are looking at it the wrong way round. What would be appropriate in these circumstances is for there to be a presumption that the form and area of the commons association is that which is favoured by the commoners. They are the people on the ground, and they know what the problems are. The kind of <br>&nbsp;<br>

difficulties that my noble friend Lord Ullswater has touched on seem to be dealt with in that manner to the general satisfaction of those who are most affected.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="51102-22_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I support my noble friend Lord Inglewood. I rather agree with him in his analysis of the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. It would be a mistake to have a presumption in favour of larger areas. Despite the fact that the ground may appear similar to look at, each common has its own identity, its own pride and its own way of working. That involves the owners as well as the farmers. It would be unhelpful for us to move in that direction. We should allow the farmers and the owners on the ground to find their own level. Any enforcement to the contrary would be counter-productive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="51102-22_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I would not presume or dare to talk about Wales in these circumstances. In England, the administration and operation of the new system of setting up commons associations will be the responsibility of Natural England. The value of the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Tyler is that it allows us to probe the Minister on what will happen in a proactive sort of way once the legislation is passed. What initiatives will be taken to encourage the setting-up of commons associations?
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Clearly, the new situation will exist, the regulations will be produced, and people will be able to operate in a bottom-up way, as the Minister talked about at Second Reading. If it is simply left to independent, spontaneous, bottom-up initiatives, the Government will not achieve what they appear to want to achieve. How do the Government see that working?
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The word &quot;targeting&quot; was used in the previous debate. Are the Government going to encourage the targeting of different parts of England to go ahead before others? Will they look at somewhere such as Dartmoor, or the Lake District, or North York Moors, or areas of the Pennines where there are lots of commons, to encourage setting up commons associations there? If so, how will they do it? If they start taking initiatives to encourage the new system to come into operation, inevitably people will give advice. Will they start giving advice on the size, the nature of the commons that might be grouped together, or the degree of contiguity that will be required? In areas such as the Pennines where there are lots of commons but they are not contiguous, what sort of advice will be given? The Minister suggested previously that funding might be available to assist in setting up commons associations. If funding is available, there is bound to be advice, because there will have to be a decision on priorities on where that funding goes, because it will not be open-ended. We have to ask the Minister these questions to get some flavour of what will happen in practice when this legislation comes into effect.

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC87</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there is no doubt that localities differ hugely. My noble friend Lord Tyler has said that the commons association has been a success on Dartmoor. I would put a full stop behind that. It may be a success on Bodmin Moor; my noble friend will know far better than I. But in some places, there are very strictly drawn commons associations. For example, a main road crossing a common is sometimes the division between two commons associations. So the word &quot;encouragement&quot; seems to me to be apposite. I shall shortly move Amendments Nos. 132 and 133 and will hold my fire until then. There may be ways and means of making progress, but I do not think it can be a top-down situation.

<a name="51102-22_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   This is the first debate on Part 2 of the Bill. It has been a very good debate on an important topic. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. I take his amendment to be a probing one, and that is how it has been debated.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>We have heard about the Second Reading of the Bill, and at that time I indicated that the third recommendation of the Royal Commission of 1958&#151;I remind noble Lords that that was for the improved management of common land&#151;remains unfulfilled. The first recommendation, which was registration, was begun by the 1965 Act and we hope that registration will be improved by the Bill. The second recommendation, which was for improved access, was fulfilled by the CROW Act 2000. We have consulted extensively on improved management since 2000 and the consensus in the stakeholder working group on the agricultural use and management of common land was that locally established, statutory commons associations are the most appropriate legislative option to achieve this aim. Part 2 of the Bill attempts to realise that recommendation.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>I hope that in the debates that we will have on Part 2 we will be able to answer many of the questions raised. Many noble Lords spoke at Second Reading on this part of the Bill. In particular, the amendments to Clauses 30 and 31 that I will move largely address the concerns noble Lords had on the functions and purpose of a commons association, including the now      notorious&#151;or famous&#151;term, &quot;sustainable agriculture&quot;, as well as the relationship an association has with the owner of the land. I am very grateful for the discussion that we had at Second Reading. I hope that noble Lords will take some comfort from the fact that the comments made informed our opinion and we hope that, as we debate this part further, noble Lords may agree that, in some cases at least, we have listened and acted on genuine concerns.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>On the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, we think it unlikely that associations will be formed for a single common, except perhaps for the largest commons. That is what we think will happen. It will be more likely that commoners and other interests on contiguous commons&#151;the noble Lord mentioned contiguous commons&#151;or groups of commons in a reasonably small area may well join together to form associations.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC88"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51102-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Associations that cover more than a single common may well lead to more effective management of common land. I believe that was one of the points which the noble Lord made at the beginning of his speech. Indeed, I believe that approach was supported by the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, on Second Reading. Associations will not be imposed from above, they will be locally initiated and locally controlled. That is the most important thing of all.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>A strong and effective association may be formed quickly and easily from only two or three agriculturally active commons in an area. However, a presumption in favour of requiring all neighbouring commons to be included in the association may ironically slow down or even prevent the establishment of an association if some interests are not supportive. We believe that the &quot;presumption in favour&quot; wording of the amendment would add an unnecessary level of inflexibility on the part of the appropriate national authority when considering the extent of any particular commons association. As I say, although there may well be circumstances where it would be right for an association to be established for a number of commons within a particular area, this will often not be the case.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, overcame his concerns about speaking from the opposition Front Bench. This Bill has nothing to do with party preference. The noble Lord and my noble friend Lord Williams have much more in common, coming, as they both do, from the Principality of Wales, than they have differences because they sit on different sides of the Chamber. That was indicated in the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, on this matter.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>There may be some agriculturally active commons in an area for which an association could sensibly be established. To include other commons in that area just because they happen to be nearby would not be sensible if they have very different characteristics. For example, those neighbouring commons may have been ungrazed for many years, and of no interest to commoning hill farmers. So we need to retain flexibility&#151;I believe that was what the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, among others argued for&#151;to determine which commons are to be covered by any particular association. The wording of the amendment is too rigid as a guideline for establishing these bodies.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>What matters is what the local interests want to happen. Some arrangements work very well and associations find that they have the powers they need, others find themselves needing more powers or more organisation to manage the land effectively. However, it is the next sentence that matters&#151;it is their choice. That should be the basis of setting up statutory commons associations.
</p>

<a name="51102-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked some interesting questions regarding what our intentions were. In relation to England, Natural England as successor to the Rural Development Service will, indeed, have a key role in helping the associations to be formed where appropriate. We need that activity to <br>&nbsp;<br>

be targeted by geographical need on the one hand and local preference on the other. Our view is that it would be quite wrong for the Act to set out a preference one way or the other. As the noble Viscount said, we want to enable commons associations to be set up and to flourish.

I thought he said that very few statutory associations would be formed. I may have misheard him. That is what I thought he said. I shall read <i>Hansard</i> carefully. I thought that was what the Bill was trying to do in the first instance, but that is another matter.

<a name="51102-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I did not take part in the debate until now as I thought that the points were well covered by colleagues from all sides of the Committee. It was not a case of my not being interested in or not caring keenly about the matter. I, too, received very good briefing from Professor Mercer. Indeed, he fights his corner clearly. He identified the cost of running a successful association. Some smaller associations may well find it more difficult; I do not know, because I do not have that information with me.
</p>

<a name="51102-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>In speaking about a matter to which we shall return shortly, the Minister mentioned flexibility. We probably all agree on it, but he said that it would happen only where local interest suggests that it should. Shortly we shall come to how you decide what local interest is and who says so, and how their choice should be overridden or decided by others. That is slightly wider; the Minister took us further along the line than the amendment. Issues arise from this, but I wanted to clarify what I thought that I had heard the Minister say in the first instance.

My understanding was that my noble friend said that the Government&#039;s expectation was that only large commons would have statutory commons associations. That is roughly what he said; I am only paraphrasing. I very much hope that small commons will have statutory commons associations. We shall get on to the question of constitution and resources, but I hope that they will not be confined to large commons. Also, I ask my noble friend to confirm&#151;I think that he has&#151;that to put anything like the amendment in the Bill would be instructing the National Assembly of Wales in an inappropriate manner.

I understand what local preference is&#151;if people come along and want to set up a commons association, they will go to the top of the list. Is that what he meant?

Government and Natural England say, &quot;Actually, there are other priorities and you&#039;ll have to wait&quot;? That might impact on the question of large and small commons, as the small ones may well be pushed to one side while the large ones are dealt with.
</p>

<a name="51102-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>I do not understand about targeting by geographical preference, however. Who will make the geographical decisions? Will someone at the centre&#151;the Government or Natural England&#151;say that commons in the south-west are to be targeted preferentially over commons in the north-east, or that commons in national parks are to be targeted, or upland commons as opposed to lowland commons, big ones as opposed to small ones or whatever it is? Is that what &quot;geographical&quot; means? Those are important questions that we want to understand. The Minister may not be able to give us thorough answers today, and might want to think about it, write to us and tell us what it means.

</p>

<a name="51102-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I assume that choices will have to be made if the number of potential commons associations coming forward is larger than the capacity of the administration and bureaucracy to deal with them over a period. There may well be a queue according to the resources available. I come back again to the Minister&#039;s comment about possibly funding the setting-up of commons associations. If the Government are to fund some of them, they will have to make choices. If those choices are not just first come, first served from local preference, how will the Government make them? The questions are fairly important and we want some answers to them.

What will it do to publicise, advise, set up training, build capacity and all the things that have to happen nowadays to encourage people? Will it not do those things? Will it just sit there and wait for people to know what has happened? Surely not. There will have to be leaflets, events, conferences, seminars and goodness knows what else. If that happens, advice will have to be given. What will that advice be?

One of the drivers for the Bill, as the Minister may agree, is that Natural England has a huge interest in seeing all those SSSIs on commons return to favourable condition. Surely, in view of the duties to be laid on it under the forthcoming Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill&#151;the NERC Bill&#151;it will be required to start targeting, first, those places with SSSIs, whereas the places best suited to having commons associations might be those with the most active graziers, but without a SSSI problem, or those commons with the most public using them where there might be more issues about grazing and public access. My noble friend raises some very important questions.

England, as it will be, has certain responsibilities concerning the condition of SSSIs. From what I can see, it is fairly clear that at the moment English Nature appears to be quite unencumbered in its ability to enter into management agreements with individual farmers on commons to achieve its objectives. Does the Minister feel that the necessity for the formation of commons associations is as great as he thinks? If English Nature can achieve its objectives and the farmers can enter into management agreements, as they do at the moment, it is more likely to be the commons that have not been designated as SSSIs and perhaps want to enter into an agri-environment scheme&#151;or are being encouraged to enter one&#151;that are likely to form associations. The number may not be as great as we think.

<a name="51102-23_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I am grateful to Members of the Committee. I shall do my best to answer them. Remember that Natural England&#039;s job will be to facilitate the establishment of commons associations. Those with interests in commons must come forward and request an association to be established. I suspect that that is what will happen in many cases where there is already an existing common or where a number of commons want to amalgamate and become one common. We hope that that will happen in a number of instances.
</p>

<a name="51102-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Noble Lords are right: where we have an interest in forming associations&#151;for example, on a common designated as an SSSI&#151;we may offer more encouragement. One of the aims of the Bill is to assist the Government to meet its PSA target of moving 95 per cent of SSSIs into favourable condition within a few years. Those are examples of where we may encourage commons to be set up, but I repeat that, in the end, it is up to those with an interest in commons to come forward and put their proposals.
</p>

<a name="51102-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>On the definition of &quot;local&quot;, where there is a keenness to set up an association and a need to do so, we hope that help will occasionally be forthcoming from Natural England. On the definition of &quot;geographical&quot;, there must be some degree of targeted support for associations, particularly where SSSIs are not in a favourable condition, and that is what is meant by those two phrases.
</p>

<a name="51102-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>What will Natural England do in enabling or assisting the setting up of associations? Clearly, one needs to look closely, with Natural England, at a whole set of issues, such as guidance, advice and training. It will be no surprise to the Committee to know that we do not have the details yet, but we believe that it will have an important role to play.
</p>

<a name="51102-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The Rural Development Service, which will be one part of Natural England, already has a track record in helping voluntary associations to form in some areas from agri-environment arrangements. That is the kind of activity that we hope to see extended under the new arrangements under the Bill. The huge importance of commons for nature conservation justifies, we believe, this kind of targeting.

How is that defined? Is that a snapshot of a time that happened, say, 100 or 200 years ago? Does a favourable condition arise in relation to how a group of scientists perceive that an area should be? &quot;Favourable condition&quot; is a badly defined phrase. Perhaps the Minister could write to me.

<a name="51102-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Let me do my best. If areas have to be designated as SSSIs, that gives a hint as to whether they would be considered favourable pieces of land for the setting up of common land for conservation purposes. That is all I meant by the word &quot;favourable&quot;. I try to explain it in an environmental context. That is the example I have chosen to give.

<a name="51102-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for his attempts to answer some of the questions I asked. He will probably agree&#151;I think this is what he said&#151;that the answer to many of these questions is not yet known. Some Members may want them to be a little better known before the Bill leaves this House. However, one further question is whether the Government have a general view of the number of commons associations or the proportion of the area of common that they would expect to be covered by associations, say, five years from the coming into effect of this clause.

<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="51102-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   We have no set idea how many. That is an impossible question to answer at this stage. If we had such a thought in mind, I think it would be rather dangerous.

It has been very helpful&#151;certainly to me, and I hope it has been to other Members. I want to emphasise two or three points. This is an opportunity. Clearly, there are some anomalous commons all over the country. The principle of local commitment and local decision making is absolutely right. I hope that there will be a re-examination of whether the precise delineation of the commons is the right one for the 21st century. Some of them have ancient history which may not be entirely relevant.
</p>

<a name="51102-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>In that context, I draw the attention of the Committee back to my amendment. I did not say that we should go for big areas. I said that they should be well-defined areas. They may be relatively small; I can think of some in my part of the country that are well defined&#151;they are relatively small, but they are well <br>&nbsp;<br>

defined. Surely that is the criteria to use. In that context, the contributions from a number of Members about the extent to which we need to balance that with local commitment is extremely important. Viability and efficiency will be delivered only if people are committed to the association.
</p>

<a name="51102-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, teased me, in a kindly fashion, for putting both sides of the argument. I am used to doing that; I am a Liberal Democrat&#151;at least we are teased for doing that. Seriously, this was intended as a probing amendment, as the Minister said. At the outset I said that I hoped that it would give the Committee an opportunity to look at these issues. In so doing, I hope we have given an indication to those who will take these important decisions at the local level so that, in future, they will have viable and democratically supported associations. In that respect, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Will the local authority have to support the idea as well? Can the Minister confirm that if there were a poor or even no response to a local inquiry, as laid out in subsection (4)(b), would that be assumed to equate to support for an association, although I doubt that it could be considered substantial?

sense, it comes together with the next group, but I shall speak generally to the points that I wish to make. My previous amendments may have been probing amendments, but in the course of time this amendment may become less of a probing amendment. My noble friend invited us to agree that in establishing an association it was up to the commoners to take the initiative. He said that in the discussion on the previous amendment. It seems to me that a fundamental point in setting up a commons association is that the commoners should take the initiative and the association should have substantial support from those who have common rights. That is the fundamental point. If, for example, the owner of a common wants to dispute, he or she is entitled to do so. Nevertheless, he should have substantial support from those who have grazing rights on the common; they should take the initiative and the relevant national authority should take account of that above all other things.
</p>

<a name="51102-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>I shall speak to the amendments in the next group, but if my amendment is accepted, it would be necessary to revise somewhat the next paragraph in the clause. This is a fundamental issue that needs to be resolved.

<a name="51102-24_spnew7"></a><b> The Earl of Caithness: </b>   I support the amendment of my noble friend the Duke of Montrose. As the Minister is aware&#151;I mentioned it at Second Reading&#151;I do not like statutory schemes at all&#151;I prefer voluntary arrangements&#151;so I do not like this part of the Bill very much. My intention, therefore, is to make it work in the best possible way for all those who, in my view, might be foolish enough to go down that route.
</p>

<a name="51102-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Williams, said in speaking to the previous amendment, the Minister said that what really matters, and what is most important, is that a commons association is locally initiated and locally controlled. If we cast our minds back to 25 October, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said that commons associations could dictate terms to all those involved. I commented on that and then my noble friend Lord Peel said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;And presumably it applies to the owner as well&quot;?,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>to which the noble Lord, Lord Bach, replied,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;The noble Earl is right&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 25/10/05; col. GC 292.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>So we have a situation where the commons association can dictate terms to all the commoners. We discovered that we also have the situation where Natural England can take an interest in a common by obtaining grazing rights. As I said, I am very suspicious of that. Would it not be a strong argument for Natural England, as a minority stakeholder&#151;I hate that word&#151;or rather a minority interest in a common, to say to the national authority, &quot;We ought to form a commons association&quot;? The national authority could well say, &quot;Natural England is a significant interest&quot;, and regardless of the wishes of the majority, a commons association would be formed. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC95"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC95</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We will discuss the powers of the associations&#151;the right to raise money and the right to sell land&#151;but I fear that there is a potential here for a minority to overturn the will of the majority. That is something that we in this country need to be very careful of.

<a name="51102-24_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I have much sympathy with the noble Earl who has just spoken. The principles elicited by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, are fundamental. I totally agree with what he said in relation to the primacy of graziers on common land. It is clear that they need to be the main driving force in this regard. That is referred to in many parts of the Bill. I take the point made by the noble Earl who said that others outwith the area might wish strongly to influence the matter, which might sideline the locality and the strength of feeling in that locality among the graziers to do something specific. Therefore, I strongly support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Williams.

<a name="51102-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Inglewood: </b>   I support those who have underlined the importance of localism, if I can put it that way, in the establishment of the commons associations. Bearing in mind the remarks of my noble friend Lord Caithness&#151;which are important to bear in mind&#151;surely the crucial point here in terms of driving forward the establishment of commons associations, is for a general regime to be in place where it is attractive for the commoners to be part of a common on which an association is established. To ensure the take-up of the provisions in this legislation&#151;I think we are generally all agreed that that is in the public interest&#151;it is crucial to ensure that they are attractive to commoners and to those who operate on the common, that they constitute the form of management that will be the most beneficial to them in the years to come. In many cases that has nothing very much to do with the legal framework of the commons associations but has a lot to do with a whole variety of other matters&#151;many of them associated with money&#151;which concern management.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="51102-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Both the amendments that we are debating are related to the type of support required to determine whether the criterion of &quot;substantial support&quot; for the establishment of a commons association is met. The noble Duke&#039;s Amendment No. 127 would require a defined level of support from the local community for the establishment of an association. Rather than assessing whether there is a substantial level of support from the interests most closely involved in the management of a common, the support of the majority of those living in the local area would be required before an association could be set up.
</p>

<a name="51102-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>On the other hand, Amendment No. 128, spoken to by my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel, will require the appropriate national authority to be satisfied only that there was substantial support from common rights holders for the establishment of an association. We do not see why it should be necessary for those in the local community to show majority support for an organisation that will have functions related only to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC96"></a>

managing agricultural activities, vegetation and rights of common on common land. Even so, the views of everyone who makes representations about the establishment of a commons association will be taken into account, including those received from local residents.
</p>

<a name="51102-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>On the other hand, we think that a narrowing of the support criterion to take account only of those entitled to rights of common does not reflect the broader interests in most commons. In many cases commons associations will consist of more than just commoners. The views of owners, holders of sporting rights and other persons or bodies with statutory duties on commons should be heard and taken into consideration when setting up a commons association.
</p>

<a name="51102-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>Clause 26(5) deliberately emphasises the views of some more than others. We think it right that &quot;particular regard&quot;&#151;that is the expression used&#151;should be given to those people who either have an interest in the common, such as commoners and owners, those engaged in agricultural activities and those who are involved in its management. That is why we think we have got this provision right. I invite noble Lords to withdraw their amendments.
</p>

<a name="51102-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>The noble Duke asked whether the local authority has to support the proposed commons association. If that was his question, the answer is that there is no particular reason for a local authority to become involved. It would be to help commons associations with a legal interest in managing the land to get their management of it right.
</p>

<a name="51102-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Before I sit down, I shall do my best to respond to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. He asked, by way of example, about Natural England asking for a commons association and expressed his concern about minorities overturning majority views. I remind him that substantial support will be required to form an association. That might be considered if the other common rights holders support Natural England&#039;s bid for an establishment order. It depends on the case. If other key interests, such as owners and rights holders did not support the bid, such an association would clearly not work. I emphasise that there is no question of Natural England overriding the wishes of the majority of the legal interests. I hope he may gain some comfort from what I have said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="51102-25_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   The noble Lord used an interesting word. He said &quot;majority&quot;. This is the first time that word has been used in the debate. Does he really mean that, or does he mean &quot;substantial support&quot; because the two are very different?

I may have been wrong to concede it. I think that it probably means substantial support&#151;or substantial opposition in this case&#151;of the legal interests.

As I said, the amendment was probing, and is phrased in such a fairly wide way to probe what the Government might mean. It was interesting to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, had to say in terms of a more specific definition of whom there should be regard to. Obviously the Government are moving in some direction towards a specific definition in subsection (5) by stating that &quot;particular regard&quot; will be paid to certain persons. I am not sure whether the Committee thinks that definition strong enough, or whether whom there should be regard to is pointed out pertinently enough. In the mean time, it would be as well to go back and read what the Minister said&#151;including his redefinition of what might be substantial support, if it is not a majority that he really means.

Furthermore, it would reduce the risks of proposals for establishing a statutory commons association being derailed by persons who choose not to be actively involved in the management of commons.

For example, the rights holder may not be involved in agricultural activity, or may have determined that economic conditions no longer justified the exercise of the rights. Equally, the inactivity of rights might be of a more temporary or short-term nature. The rights holder may have signed up to an agri-environment agreement which effectively prevents him or her using the rights for a period. He may have recently purchased a dominant tenement and not decided how to use the rights; or he may not have restocked after <br>&nbsp;<br>

suffering the impact of disease. In short, there are many reasons why a rights holder might be inactive in the short or long term. However, he would still be caught by the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment.
</p>

<a name="51102-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>We would not want to prevent such persons being involved or having their voices heard in the establishment of a commons association. That is particularly important for those whose inactivity is of only a short-term nature and who plan to activate the use of their common rights when the conditions are favourable. There is also a problem in deciding who is and who is not an active commoner. A nice point of decision, for example, would be whether grazing one ewe for one day of the year constituted an active exercise of rights, or whether it should be some greater proportion of rights for a specific part of the year, and whether it should be the same for each common or different. It would be very difficult to decide when a person was &quot;exercising&quot; their rights of common.
</p>

<a name="51102-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>We are aware of concerns of some commoners and owners, particularly on commons where there are large numbers of inactive rights holders, that their concerns may be overpowered by the large number of inactive graziers. We do not think this will be the case as commons associations may be given only a limited range of functions, related to the management of common rights, vegetation and agricultural activity. If active graziers on a common were not prepared to support an association, there is little it could do, and it is extremely unlikely that an association would be formed on an agriculturally active common without the support of the active graziers. So in this instance we do not think that the proposed change is required.

Obviously, for once I do not agree with my noble friend, but I accept what he says. It was interesting that in his response the Minister suggested that a large number of inactive holders might pose a problem. I am paraphrasing his words wrongly, but he recognised that there could be a problem if there were a large number of inactive holders of common rights.

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, who obviously feels as I do that the rights of active commoners take precedence over other rights. It would be interesting to define&#151;perhaps the Government have thought about it&#151;how long inactivity could continue. It could be for years or for a short term. I take the Minister&#039;s point. Obviously after the foot and mouth outbreak there were times when activity did not take place because of disease control. I thank Members of the Committee who have spoken, whether we agree or disagree.

<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="51102-26_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, when he said that this part of the Bill is not adequate in its present form. The wording raises many questions. It would be a waste of parliamentary time to deal with them in a vast range of amendments. Between now and Report, I hope that the noble Lord will reflect on many of the concerns raised by several Members of the Committee. If he does not, we shall bring forward amendments again on Report in order to get clearer clarification.
</p>

<a name="51102-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Subsection (1) is written in a way that makes it appear that the national authority would be breaking new ground, to say nothing of imposing superior knowledge, strength or wisdom on many parts of the countryside. I wonder how the commons associations that already abound&#151;many of which are doing an excellent job&#151;will feel about whether this subsection may jeopardise what they do and the way in which they currently work, and whether regulations due to come out will be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51102-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Subsection (2) deals with publishing draft orders and consulting on them. Once again, we will not know what those orders are until the Bill has passed through this House and, I suspect, another place. Subsection (3) allows for the holding of a public inquiry. What would prompt that? Would there always be one in circumstances where the Government seek to change the way in which an existing association works? Who would bear the cost? Where would it be heard? Our lengthy discussions today raise many questions.
</p>

<a name="51102-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Subsection (4) constrains the national authority in setting up the commons associations unless representations are made as the result of any public inquiry to show substantial support. I still do not think that we have clarified &quot;substantial support&quot;. Subsection (5) lays down three categories of persons whose representations must be taken into account. Unfortunately, the Bill makes no attempt to give those clauses any weighting. Would it be possible, for instance, that a person entitled to exercise the rights of common would be given a higher weighting than the occupiers or those with an interest in the land? Is it likely or even possible that people with an interest in the land and those with management duties for the land could out-vote those entitled to exercise rights of common? This clause is too vague and has raised many questions .

I do not intend to speak for long, except to remind Members of the Committee that this clause provides for local interests&#151;notably, the commoners and the landowner&#151;to decide whether they ought to avail themselves of the powers of the Bill.

   &quot;TRANSFORMATION TO STATUTORY COMMONS ASSOCIATION

<br>
   A voluntary commons association may apply to the appropriate national authority to be a statutory commons association.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_103"></a>The noble Lord said: In proposing Amendments Nos. 132 and 133, I will try to move the debate on. I shall not spend a long time on this. Amendment No. 132 gives an opportunity for a locally made decision that may encourage some local commons associations who wish to do so the opportunity to become statutory commons associations. A voluntary commons association may apply to the appropriate national authority to be a statutory commons association. I am referring to one voluntary commons association, not necessarily a lot of them combining, although that might be part of the process if other local commons and commoners associations wish to go along with that. At present, nearly all commons associations are voluntary associations anyway. Certainly in Wales the figure is 100 per cent, and, in England, the vast majority are voluntary commons associations.
</p>

<a name="51102-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>It may be in the interests of the commons associations to be statutory in specific circumstances if that is the wish locally. Environmental management schemes may benefit from grant aid where perhaps there is a vision within a commons association to do some specific things in the management of its common. But that is its decision. All that Amendment No. 132 does is to give the possibility of that opportunity if it so wishes. In other words, it is a gradualist approach to encourage associations that, if they wish to do this, they can do so.
</p>

<a name="51102-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Amendment No. 133 is a new clause addressing voluntary commons associations, of which many do not have a precise constitution.

<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="51102-27_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   As the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, said, Amendment No. 132 would enable an existing commoners association, which has been set up on a voluntary non-statutory basis, to apply to the appropriate national authority to become a statutory commons association under Part 2. Existing commoners associations set up on a purely voluntary basis are often in the fortunate position of already having agreed local arrangements. Having this in place will obviously help in their transformation into statutory commons associations, if that is what they wish.
</p>

<a name="51102-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>We do not believe that that should be such an automatic process as the noble Lord&#039;s amendment implies. Statutory commons associations may be given powers to make binding rules that will affect all those engaged in agricultural activity on a common. Breach of some of those rules may result in a criminal offence being committed. Therefore, as I am sure the noble Lord will agree, it is important the appropriate national authority is satisfied that there is substantial support among all key interests in a common before such an association with that degree of power is established. It must be set up as a statutory commons association on formal lines with a fair and balanced constitution and transparent procedures. That can best be achieved by going through a formal process of consultation on a draft establishment order.
</p>

<a name="51102-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Nothing prevents a voluntary association requesting the appropriate national authority to start the statutory process. We would wish to encourage it. I am in total agreement with the noble Lord on that.
</p>

<a name="51102-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Amendment No. 133 would enable an existing voluntary commoners association to adopt a model constitution by application to the commons registration authority. We are very happy, where existing commoners associations work well, to see those associations maintain their voluntary status. There is no obligation under the Bill for commoners associations to move up to statutory status&#151;far from it.
</p>

<a name="51102-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, would enable a commoners association to apply to the commons registration authority for a model constitution. Adopting a template constitution may be a very good move in terms of creating more effective and democratically run procedures, but an association can do that now without reference to the local authority. I hope that reassures the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="51102-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>As a voluntary body, a commoners association can organise itself on whichever model it wishes. Many associations have no doubt established themselves with the help of a local solicitor and so have developed their own constitution. We do not see a need for provision in the Bill along those lines. In fact we believe, and would want to see, that the Bill is not an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC103"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC103</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

appropriate mechanism or place because the organisation of voluntary bodies representing commoners is a matter for them. I think I can see the noble Lord agreeing with me, and I hope that he feels able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="51102-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Inglewood: </b>   On the principle that the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, has described behind the provision, my understanding concerning Cumbria is that the cost of establishing a number of the voluntary associations has been very considerable&#151;tens of thousands of pounds. That is from people not in the general perception of &quot;well off&quot;. Sheep and uphill farming is not one of the sectors currently booming in this country. If there were a simple and cheap way for voluntary commons associations to transform themselves into statutory commons associations, I am sure that &quot;procedure&quot; would be welcomed by the farming community and might bring forward take-up of statutory associations, which is something the Government wants.
</p>

<a name="51102-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The noble Baroness said that it is up to any voluntary association to decide whether it wishes to be a statutory association. But my understanding of the structure of what is proposed is that it will be advantageous to be a statutory commons association. To take one illustrative example, in his remarks about severance&#151;when I am afraid I was unable to be here&#151;the Minister commented that severance would be possible in certain circumstances when there was a statutory commons association. But, as I understand it, it would not be the case where there was a voluntary commons association. So there are definite advantages that flow to the common and the commoners from being a statutory association, particularly in the spirit of what is behind this legislation. Commoners have often dug jolly deep into their own pockets to establish voluntary associations, which are what I think all parties would like to see. I hope that it will be possible to provide a mechanism so that they can move forward, if not as of right, at least in a manner that mitigates the administration and expense that falls on those concerned.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="51102-27_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I shall write to the noble Lord if I am wrong, but my understanding is that there is nothing between us in what we are seeking to achieve. The points that he has made are points that my noble friend made in debate, as the noble Lord recognised. The issue is whether the amendment does anything to remove any impediment or to make the process easier, apart from making the process automatically move from A to B. I hope that I have explained that, because of the nature of the difference between the statutory association and the voluntary one&#151;I gave the example of its stronger powers in terms of criminal offence&#151;we would have to be assured that the process was fair and equitable, but none of us wish to see it become administratively cumbersome or unnecessarily expensive. I am certain that I can give the noble Lord the assurance he is seeking.

asking for, but I shall press her on this matter. She is saying that the normal processes of consultation and demonstration of support apply if a group of commoners, or people interested in the common, are to move from being a voluntary association to a statutory association. Is the Minister saying that that process of consultation can achieve a situation in which the same association, perhaps by necessary changes to its constitution and membership, can move from being a voluntary association to a statutory association, or is she saying that the voluntary association will have to close down and a new statutory association will have to start up? That is the problem that would cause extra costs.

This is a simple statement of how it is possible to become more effective as a commons association. As the noble Baroness said, this may not be the appropriate place, particularly for voluntary commons associations, but none the less, it is a form of guidance for commons associations to become more effective. Perhaps a few of them may wish, for reasons stated, to become statutory commons associations. Information about guidance and consultation of this nature may well appear in regulations; I do not know. But I think it should be drawn to the attention of commons associations that they are able to move forward efficiently and effectively and be, perhaps, slightly better organised.

In many commons associations, the members feel at a disadvantage in negotiations. Often they more precisely know the situation on the ground than the people with whom they are discussing the matters. Sometimes they are overruled or inadequately informed as a result of decisions made at the time. I am making a plea to give the commons associations more force in negotiations, <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51102-28_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I thank the noble Earl; he put it more succinctly than I could have done. One problem that could arise from the amendment is that a commons association may not be representative of all the interests in a common. Associations can be established, for example, without the support of all rights holders and owners. We are not talking about a public body representing the interests and needs of all the users of a common. Negotiations are not a matter of the status of the bodies involved; they are about arriving at a conclusion beneficial to all.
</p>

<a name="51102-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Once a statutory commons association is in place, it will acquire status by virtue of its ability to represent the interests in the common, and its ability to deliver on that commitment through the promotion of binding rules. Bodies such as Natural England will deal with the commons association because it is, so to speak, the only relevant body. The amendment is not needed to give an artificial boost to the status of a commons association, because the very purpose of the association being formed is to enable negotiations and discussions on the specific common.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of the amendment is to draw attention to the issues surrounding all the commons that abut marine areas. I thank the officials in the department for furnishing me with information about the extent and scale of the problem. They have, as far as they are able, defined that there are some 129 commons of which some part is <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC106</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

below mean high water, and of those 110 have an area below mean high water of less than a hectare. There are 39 commons with an area below mean high water of over a hectare, and that totals 2,734 hectares below mean high water, so we are not talking about a very small problem here. It is not just the size of those commons that is a problem, which include foreshores and saltings and places that you would expect to be below mean high water, but they have other particular issues.
</p>

<a name="51102-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>As we understand from scientists and geographers, the east of England is sinking and I am thinking now of the saltings around Norfolk that feature largely on the Defra list. In the west of England, we are faced with rising sea levels, as is everywhere, but also more particularly tidal surges because of the more extreme weather conditions. That means that those commons that exist now as bits of land may well cease to do so in the future. I should declare an interest, because I live in the parish of Northam in Devon, which has an extensive area, Northam Burrows, which abuts the marine area. It was while walking there and thinking about the Bill that I began to ponder the problem. Those burrows are protected from the sea by the pebble ridge. It is putting back the pebbles on the pebble ridge that has given rise to the term &quot;potwalloping&quot;, which the noble Lord will remember I referred to at Second Reading. Were that pebble ridge no longer to be maintained, the area of common would be entirely lost.
</p>

<a name="51102-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>I am aware of discussions that Defra and English Nature are having all around Britain, and there will be times when managed retreat is seen as a sensible alternative to maintaining flood defences. If managed retreat is the option taken&#151;that is when the sea defences are no longer maintained and the land effectively becomes salt marsh again&#151;those areas which at the moment do not face encroachment by the sea will start to face encroachment, and that will include common land. Some commoners may well lose their rights or their rights may be substantially changed, and there would not be the opportunity that we discussed earlier to offer them contiguous land, because the problem may affect the entire coast until we arrive at more substantial cliff areas.
</p>

<a name="51102-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to probe Government thinking about the issues surrounding commons that are within spitting distance of the sea and which will have their own particular problems. They are not referred to anywhere in the Bill or in the regulatory impact assessment as a discrete body of commons, and yet when we consider things such as works that we will get on to later, again the sorts of things that they may need to address may be very different from commons either in uplands or inland areas.

<a name="51102-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The noble Duke said: We move now to the question of the establishment of constitutions for these commons associations. The point of the amendment is simply that, paying all due homage to devolved powers, it does not seem to make sense that commons associations in England and Wales should be subject to different standard terms. These associations are run mainly by volunteers, and some may cover the boundary between England and Wales&#151;I am not sufficiently familiar with the areas about which we are talking. It is important that nothing is done to diminish the volunteers&#039; enthusiasm for the task. We consider that requiring agreement between the two national authorities will tend to ensure that the practical considerations are given due weight.
</p>

<a name="51102-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a> I shall speak also to Amendment No. 138 which is grouped with Amendment No. 136. The phrase &quot;subject as follows&quot; seems out of place here in the <br>&nbsp;<br>

sense that one might have expected it to be followed by a list of sub-paragraphs rather than subsections. On first reading I felt that something had been left out of subsection (2). Of course, something has been left out; namely that the draft standard term should be published before the Bill moves on from this House. Given that a particular commons association may be subject to some variation of the standard terms, we should be able to see and comment on at least that standard. Otherwise commons associations may be subject to a set of rules that have not been scrutinised by a Parliament and are themselves amendments of rules that have also not been discussed either here or in another place.
</p>

<a name="51102-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>I notice too that there is a government amendment attached to this group, Amendment No. 249.

<a name="51102-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Clause 49 allows the Government to amend any Act to disapply provisions relating to land covered by Part 1 of the Bill. Clause 28(1) introduces standard terms to the constitution of a commons association. The new clause will allow the Government to amend or repeal any relevant part of a local or personal Act applying to common land. All three situations will now require the Government to lay a draft for approval before each House. I beg to move.

<a name="51102-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Amendment No. 136 requires the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales to agree on regulations prescribing the standard terms of the constitution and administration of an association. Amendment No. 138 removes the provision in Clause 28 that allows the standard constitution to be varied or supplemented by individual establishment orders where necessary. Noble Lords will be pleased to hear that my department and the Welsh Assembly Government have worked closely on the development of the Bill and will continue to work closely during implementation. But that does not mean that the way in which we implement the Bill in detail will necessarily be the same in both countries. We do not believe that there is a need for the two authorities to agree on the form of regulations as each will be creating regulations suited to the requirements of each country. But we expect that in all material respects the standard constitutions for England and Wales will be similar in content.
</p>

<a name="51102-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>On Amendment No. 138, the standard constitution will contain the elements common to all associations. They will apply to all associations, but in certain situations we may want to vary or supplement the terms of the standard constitution to reflect particular local circumstances. The words &quot;subject as follows&quot; in Clause 28(2) ensure that the terms of the standard constitution can be varied, and Clause 26 goes on to specify in what manner. We think that removing those words reduces the flexibility needed to allow local circumstances to be taken into account in deciding what the constitution of an individual association <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC109"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC109</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should look like. Regulations under Clause 28 will be made before an association is established so it will be clear what the standard constitution is.
</p>

<a name="51102-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Government Amendment No. 249 fulfils a recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of this House. It recommended that the significant common principles of the constitution and administration of associations should appear on the face of the Bill or, if the Bill stays as it is, that regulations made by the Secretary of State under Clause 28 should be subject to the affirmative procedure. We agree that it would be appropriate to have greater scrutiny of the matters that would generally be common to each association, which would include voting rights and membership requirements. We considered carefully whether they should be placed on the face of the Bill. When we tested it for the various types of commons associations that could be established, it became unnecessarily limiting and, in some cases, that approach might have prevented associations being established at all. That is because every common is unique in terms of its physical characteristics and its combination of rights holders, owners and other interests. We believe that having a standard constitution confirmed by affirmative resolution, rather than on the face of the Bill, gives each local common the opportunity to establish an association that fits the local situation. That is why we have tabled Amendment No. 249 to implement the Committee&#039;s recommendation to have the standard constitution subject to the affirmative procedure. In due course, I will move that amendment.

We did not suggest that the two authorities should agree on all the regulations that will be applied under the Bill. It was only for the standard terms of the constitution. As has been pointed out to us, there will be possibilities for varying the constitution to suit the circumstances of individual commons associations, but it might be a help if the standard terms were uniform across the two authorities. That is the area that we wish to probe. We probably wish to revisit this at some point, but in the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51102-29_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I can reassure the noble Baroness. As she said, the draft constitution guidance is being circulated. The standard constitution will make provision allowing the public to attend meetings of an association. I know noble Lords will understand that there will be provision in discussion of financial or other personal matters of individuals for members of the public to be excluded. For example, were an association to be discussing whether to take legal proceedings against an individual, it would patently not be right for the individual to be present to hear the discussion of the case. There is nothing between us here; but it is not necessary to put it in the Bill. As far as I can see, it will work in the same way as local government, where the constitution and the framework are there. I hope that the noble Baroness is reassured.

In Grand Committee, there is nothing that I can do about it, which is the slight disappointment of operating in Grand Committee at this stage, but I will proceed.
</p>

<a name="51102-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>At Second Reading I highlighted the fact that the Bill poses as many question as it answers. Noble Lords will realise that we are disappointed that the Bill before us is so skeletal and leaves so much to regulation. Having said, that, I would also like to record our thanks for the statutory instruments that were put forward and for the Government&#039;s response to the Committee that an amendment that we will debate later should have the affirmative resolution attached. The draft regulations to Clause 28 have tried to address some of the questions that I have posed, such as eligibility, selection, length of term, re-election to a commons association. As such, I welcome the suggested three-year term and further clarification as to how associations will make decisions. However, I am not wholly satisfied.
</p>

<a name="51102-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>For example, the draft regulations in paragraph 8 state that except where specified elsewhere, all decisions will be taken by a vote with the majority of the vote deciding the outcome. It states that those present at the meeting may participate in the vote. Did the Minister consider enabling proxy voting or votes in <br>&nbsp;<br>

absence for such proceedings? I see later that the association may appoint members to committees to deliver certain functions. Will their decision-making process happen in the same way? Could a committee have a meeting and a vote on a decision without consulting the rest of the association? Similarly, could a meeting called by a third of the association membership vote on issues against those that they may have failed to invite? I am sure that is not meant. I am referring there to paragraph 11.
</p>

<a name="51102-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>However, the clause not only provides for regulations to set up a standard constitution but for the provisions to be altered. While we on these Benches understand the need for flexibility to meet the needs of different commons, I question the degree of flexibility to make changes to the standard constitution and beyond that to the establishment. What good is a standard constitution or the draft regulations that we have been given if in theory they could all be altered?
</p>

<a name="51102-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>For example, the draft sample that we have been given with regard to Clause 25 states that the membership of the commons association must be more than 10 but less than 12. Will the provisions in Clause 28(3) enable that to be altered? I also understand that a number of commoners may vary from common to common, but what if only three commoners wish to set up an association and were a minority compared to those with rights on that particular common? It is surely not a very democratic option, especially when they can then dictate the rules to other commoners who are not in the association.

<a name="51102-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>As the discussions throughout the clause have suggested, there are still some outstanding questions.

<a name="51102-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>In other words, the national authority can tear up the standard constitution and say that it wants something different; or different in different circumstances. So in a sense, what is the point of having a standard constitution? Each commons is different and probably needs a different constitution. I would be most grateful if my noble friend could enlighten me.

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="51102-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I will do my best to enlighten my noble friend. We think that it will make it much easier for commons that want to establish a statutory association to have a standard constitution from which they can pick and choose what is relevant to their needs.

This is a two-tier approach, with a standard constitution prescribed in regulations with individual establishment orders able to vary this case by case. Not <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The noble Baroness asked many detailed questions about the draft regulations that we have circulated. They are important points, but frankly they are matters of detail which will be discussed and which we will consult on before implementing the draft regulations. We can reconsider the good points that she made in the light of the responses. I remind the Committee that the regulations will come before both Houses for affirmative approval. They will certainly be debated in due course.

<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="51102-30_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I am still confused by the terminology of standard terms when you read a statement like, &quot;members of the commons association shall be elected, appointed, or co-opted&quot;. Those are three very different models of arriving at a commons association. Even taking that small example alone, it is hardly a standard model.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="51102-30_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   It is a draft constitution. As I said, it will be open to consultation before a final version is put before both Houses of Parliament in the normal way. The points made by the noble Baroness will be taken on board. It is important that a standard constitution should have some degree of flexibility. It is meant to aid and assist those who want to have statutory commons associations. It is perhaps worth waiting until the affirmative resolution debate is held rather than opposing the clause standing part of the Bill now. All those points can be put then and the regulations can be voted down, if that is what the House chooses to do.

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="51102-30_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I am grateful to both noble Lords who have followed me along the line of querying the Government. The Minister is a lawyer; I am not. I am a very simple soul. But when he says we have a standard constitution and then he goes on to say that you can pick and choose and you are able to vary it, I begin to wonder what happened to the standard in the first place. Either you have a goal to aim for or you have a standard laid down. I am intrigued; but it is a minor point.
</p>

<a name="51102-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, about whether it is elected, co-opted or appointed is a real issue. The Minister slightly chided me in saying that I should wait until the statutory instruments come through. As he knows too well, once the Bill has passed it has passed. Yes, he said that we can vote things down in the House, but I cannot think of the last time when we voted even affirmative regulations down. If his team could tell me when we did I would be impressed. I have struggled heavily to raise these issues with Ministers over the years on many different points. While we may win the argument, there is no question of having a vote that we will win. With due respect to the Minister, that is not quite fair.

We have elsewhere asked questions about who will pay for public inquiries and the costs involved in changing registers and setting up commons associations. The Minister was gracious enough to make some comment about that earlier. One-off costs are quite different from ongoing charges, and the distribution of commons and greens is not even across the country. To ask some local taxpayers to pick up running costs for commons associations, while leaving others free to enjoy the benefits but bear no pain, is unfair. Furthermore, placing the onus on the commons associations themselves should militate against an overgenerous scale of allowances where the income from the commons cannot support it.

I have some general questions for my noble friend on a subject raised earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. The constitution, as set out in the Bill and presumably reflected in regulations, is complex for a number of aspiring commons associations. I have two questions. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC114"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC114</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

First, what advice will be given by the Countryside Council for Wales to aspiring commons associations? How will all that work, if it works? The same may be true in England. Secondly, if it is expensive to set up a commons association, who do we expect to pay?
</p>




<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="51102-30_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The amendments make small changes to the illustrative lists of terms which can be included in the standard constitution or establishment order of a commons association. The standard constitution is, of course, a draft model constitution. Amendment No. 139 seeks to ensure that if a provision is included about the payment of allowances to members, such payment should come from money owned by the commons associations. Amendment No. 141 removes from Clause 29 the illustrative list of the type of provision that might be made in the standard constitution or an establishment order about the keeping and publication of an association&#039;s accounts and reports.
</p>

<a name="51102-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>Clause 29 provides illustrative lists of the elements which might appear in either the standard constitution or an establishment order of an individual association. I was not sure whether the noble Duke was praising or condemning us for having put such detail into the clause; I look forward to hearing which he was doing&#151;perhaps neither. The terms are general in nature, referring to broad categories rather than specific detail. For example, the current wording, which refers to payment of allowances to members, does not prevent the national authority specifying more detail to suit the circumstances of a particular association, or leaving out any provision for the payment of allowance altogether.
</p>

<a name="51102-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The inclusion of terms about appointment of auditors and preparation and publication of accounts is helpful to illustrate what might go into the constitution of an association. I reiterate that the terms in subsection (5) are not requirements which must be included in the association&#039;s constitution, but examples of what may be included. It would be perfectly proper to leave out such provision, if that were appropriate in the circumstances. For example, if a commons association were very small&#151;we have heard Members of the Committee praise small ones today&#151;it might not be reasonable to require the publication of an annual report.
</p>

<a name="51102-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I shall move on to the noble Duke&#039;s question. Nothing in the Bill requires or can require local authorities to contribute to the running costs of a commons association, unless perhaps they are in the business themselves of exercising rights of common. Of course local authorities may wish to contribute to the costs, particularly if the matter is important to the achievement of local objectives that they set.

&quot;(1)   An order under section 25 is to confer on a commons association functions relating to any one or more of the following&#151;

<br>
(a)   the management of agricultural activities on the land for which the association is established;


<br>
(b)   the management of vegetation on the land;


<br>
(c)   the management of rights of common on the land.


<br>
(2)   The functions conferred on an association under subsection (1) must be those the appropriate national authority considers appropriate in the case of that association.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_147"></a>The noble Lord said: We have already debated how a commons association may be established. Now it is time to address the reasons for establishing an association. This brings us to Clause 30, which was the subject of much lively discussion at Second Reading. That debate highlighted the many concerns people had with the way in which Clause 30 was drafted. Questions posed by, for example, by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, regarding management of vegetation, and by the noble Lord, Lord  Rotherwick, concerning protection of the broader public interest in common land, have helped&#151;they will be pleased to hear&#151;to direct our thinking towards the key elements in this clause requiring improvement.
</p>

<a name="51102-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Over the summer months, we have had lengthy discussions with many people, including landowners and commoners, both those exercising and those not exercising their rights, and with organisations representing wider public interests in common land, such as recreation and nature conservation. The Government&#039;s amendments before the Committee will go some considerable way towards satisfying a wide range of concerns while still achieving our primary aim, which is to have flexible associations that can be established for a range of purposes and that will stand the test of time.
</p>

<a name="51102-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Clause 30 specifies the functions that can be given to a commons association. Amendment No. 142 removes subsection (2), which required all associations to have the purpose of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;protecting and promoting sustainable agriculture&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>and replaces it with a broader set of functions related to the management of common rights, management of vegetation, and management of agricultural activities.
</p>

<a name="51102-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I shall explain the reasons for this change. First, there was a great deal of confusion and conflict over the meaning of the term &quot;sustainable agriculture&quot;. We felt it better to ensure there was no future doubt about our intentions for commons associations. Secondly, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC117"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC117</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we wished to &quot;future-proof&quot; associations to ensure that common land could be managed for reasons other than purely agricultural production. This is particularly important at a time of agricultural policy change and uncertainty over the future of farming in more marginal areas such as uplands, about which we heard earlier. Thirdly, we wanted to better enable associations to be established on lowland commons where there may be little or no agricultural activity and the pressures and management requirements of commons are very different.
</p>

<a name="51102-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>On consideration, we concluded that the clause as drafted would allow commons associations to manage common land only for agricultural production purposes. The changes brought about by Amendment No. 142 will enable associations to manage a broader range of commons, including those where no agricultural activity is currently taking place. They will also provide security against the effects of future changes in agricultural policy.
</p>

<a name="51102-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>I trust these changes to the purpose and functions of a commons association will ameliorate the concerns expressed at Second Reading by a number of noble Lords. For example, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, and the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, all pointed out to us quite strongly that the term &quot;sustainable agriculture&quot; was problematic in a number of ways.
</p>

<a name="51102-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The strength of their arguments forced us to look again at this vital element and, after careful consideration, we were persuaded. We now agree that this is not the correct purpose for a commons association. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said&#151;and we agree&#151;that it is too narrow and constraining as a management purpose. The debate in July persuaded us to explore more widely, and to develop a set of functions that will enable commons associations to engage with a broader set of issues on commons through management of the vegetation, and of agricultural activities, without having to meet any predetermined sustainable agriculture purpose.

</p>

<a name="51102-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>In the stand part debate on Clause 26, we discussed the functions that could be conferred on any association. These amendments introduce greater flexibility, but do not require every association to acquire all the functions mentioned in Clause 30. For example, if a group of upland graziers simply want to manage grazing of the common by the commoners&#039; animals, they may just take functions relating to the management of common rights. If another association wanted to manage the grazing of others such as landowners as well, then they may also be granted functions relating to management of agricultural activities. For those commons where there is no grazing at all, but there is a desire to introduce vegetation management of another kind, that also may be achieved.

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The amendments in this group, Amendment No. 142 in particular, concern enabling commons associations to be established across the many different types of commons that exist today and are not about imposing a novel set of functions and obligations on upland commons.

</p>

<a name="51102-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 142A is to try to improve the wording a little. I have proposed the words,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Surely, that is what we want the commons associations to do. We want them to maintain the commons in that state. I chose those words because they are the words that the Minister used in col. GC 294 on 25 October. I felt that those were better words than are contained in his subsections (a) and (b). However, I am still concerned about both his and my amendments with regard to the word &quot;agricultural&quot;.

<a name="51102-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>The Minister will recall that at Second Reading I used the words &quot;good husbandry and land management&quot;. I still like the idea of &quot;good husbandry&quot;. It is a little outdated as a phrase, but, as a land agent, I believe that everyone knows what good husbandry is; we have worked with it, we understand it and it covers more than the word &quot;agriculture&quot;. I did not use the word &quot;husbandry&quot; because I believe that some commons might have been improved by ploughing. They might be improved grasslands and might need to be ploughed at some time in the future. Therefore, the word &quot;husbandry&quot; might be too tight a definition.

include the grazing of horses. I remember that from when I was active as a land agent. We come back to the rights of the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, on his common, on which he has horses. Then I read Amendment No. 153, which the Minister tabled. I wondered whether its purpose was to include horses, because once you get rid of &quot;livestock&quot;, you include them because horses are not necessarily livestock. I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that. If that is the case, I am happier with &quot;agricultural&quot; and hope that he will be able to consider whether my wording is better than his.

<a name="51102-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 143 and 144. I must immediately tell the Committee that they were tabled at a very early stage, long before I saw the Minister&#039;s Amendment No. 142, let alone the noble Earl&#039;s Amendment No. 142A, or my noble friends&#039; Amendment No. 146. As a considerable novice in this place, I think that wiser counsels may come before the Committee. However, this gives me an opportunity to say a couple of words about my amendments.
</p>

<a name="51102-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Members of the Committee may have a problem with my reference to &quot;access&quot;. I had a particular circumstance in mind. Clearly the Countryside and Rights of Way Act covers problems of access to a large extent, but there are special occasions when an association will have to think a little about ways in which, on a temporary basis, it may have to consider access questions. For example, I have in mind in the lambing season that the commoners may well wish to see whether they need to do something&#151;by way of publicity more than anything else&#151;to ensure that dogs are not left unattended on common land. That is a familiar problem in the uplands. I have to accept that, from the way in which the discussion has developed, Amendment No. 142 goes a long way to meeting my concerns at Second Reading, and obviously those of many other noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="51102-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>This is a very important part of the Bill. I note that some of the provisions in Clause 30 do not seem to appear precisely in the regulations as drafted. Perhaps that is appropriate and necessary or perhaps it is a slip of the tongue, as it were. However, I notice in the West Barsetshire Commons Association Establishment Order 2006 that there is a much wider definition of a function of the association&#151;that of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;maintaining and renewing fences or other boundaries between the Commons and adjoining land&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>than in Clause 30. It is that sort of mismatch that may cause concern if we pass the Bill in its present form and do not have some clear definition.
</p>

<a name="51102-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Incidentally, Professor Ian Mercer from the Dartmoor Commoners Council, to which I referred earlier, tells me that it is normally,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;the custom on upland commons at least that the owner of adjacent in-bye land must fence against the common, so there is no need for an association to have this function&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>That is clearly relevant to the discussion on the amendments. The function may not need to be put in such terms, but left more open.

</p>

<a name="51102-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>The Minister has responded very pragmatically. The amendment is much more flexible than the original provision, and I took comfort from his comment that the range of purposes must withstand the test of time. We do not seem to be able to deal with commons legislation more than once in a lifetime&#151;possibly once in a century&#151;so it is extremely important that we do it well this time. I endorse the comment of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, that it would be a vast improvement on the Bill as originally intended if Amendment No. 142 went into statute in the end.
</p>

<a name="51102-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>On that basis, this is an important discussion, but I do not feel that my amendments will be that much better than that already tabled by the Minister. As a footnote, I wait with interest to hear what my noble friends have to say about Amendment No. 146, which seems to contain a very convenient expression of what we all seek to establish&#151;the sustainable management of common land.

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="51102-32_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I shall speak to Amendment No. 145, which is in this group. I also thank the Minister for listening to what was said at Second Reading. Seeing some of the amendments that have been tabled, I suspect that that helped to clarify the Government&#039;s thinking on this section of the Bill. We are grateful to the Minister because we have had great difficulties over the weeks trying to describe &quot;sustainable agriculture&quot;, and I think &quot;agricultural activities&quot; is acceptable. With regard to horses, my understanding is that they are not agricultural animals and therefore they were not considered in that way. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that.

<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>to the end of Clause 30(2). I shall enlarge upon that. I raised this matter at Second Reading but, so far, I do not think it has been resolved. An order under Section 25 will give the commons association a legal duty to manage agricultural activities, vegetation and the rights of common on the land for which they act. Prior to Amendment No. 142, the duty laid down in the Bill was to protect and promote sustainable agriculture. While I welcome the noble Lord&#039;s Amendment No. 142, as I have said already, I am still concerned and I hope that it does not water down any responsibility for making sure that we have sustainable agriculture within those agricultural activities. If he will enlighten me on that, I will be very glad. We are concerned that the Government, in general terms, do not put as much weight behind agricultural productivity as we would. With self-sufficiency in food down to 63 per cent, I would like the Minister to confirm that the Government are full square behind the need to have commercial agriculture&#151;food and farming&#151;in this country. In fairness, I heard him say that at the conference this morning.
</p>

<a name="51102-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I turn to the other side of the matter, which is how we value and equate leisure pursuits and leisure activities and the rights of some with the equal concerns of those who earn their living from the <br>&nbsp;<br>

common that supports them and their families. Two noble Lords are from a part of Wales that I visited when I was on holiday in the Brecon Beacons this summer. I talked to some farmers there, and they were extremely concerned that access had brought additional problems for them. Whereas in the past the general public were not able to walk freely within the Brecon Beacons, apart from on the defined paths, farmers are now finding that people are walking through with dogs not on leads. That is bad at lambing time, and raises problems when it is not lambing time because sheep are being scattered. There is a constant passage in &quot;hot spot&quot; areas, rather than farther afield.
</p>

<a name="51102-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>I wonder about the balance of other enactments with what the Government are trying to do in Amendment No. 142. I do not know whether the Government have given thought to that; I hope that they have. That is the starting point of Amendment No. 145. I am not belittling what the Government have done in Amendment No. 142, but I do not want it to weaken the commercial activity of farming, which must continue in the commons, nor do I want to find that the rights of others act in a preferential way that is detrimental to those objects being achieved. I will look forward to what other noble Lords have to say on their amendments.

<a name="51102-33_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I thank the Government for moving as far as they have in addressing the concerns that many of us raised on Second Reading. I thank my noble friend Lord Tyler for his kind mention of my Amendment No. 146. When I tabled it I wondered whether it was much too simple to address the problem. I was attracted to the form of words because the more we try to define activities and distinguish between an agricultural function and an environmental function, the more difficulties that creates. Should we discuss the management of vegetation? But what would happen if there was a plague of rabbits and the relevant people were not entitled to manage anything other than the vegetation unless that task comprised an agricultural function? That kind of delineation could lead to a lot of arguments. That is why I eventually chose the simple form of words in Amendment No. 146.
</p>

<a name="51102-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>The Minister may criticise the amendment but I commend its form of words for inclusion on the face of the Bill. The Government are very fond of introducing regulations and the amendment would permit them to do so. To try to define further in the Bill exactly what is meant by &quot;sustainable management&quot; would create arguments and difficulties. I prefer a simple provision, if that is possible.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;Where non-agricultural activity occurs or is proposed for a common, the relevant commons association must be consulted on whether such developments will interfere with sustainable agriculture&quot;.</p>

<a name="51102-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>As my noble friend Lord Tyler said, things have moved on. I shall discuss Amendment No. 142 in a moment. My Amendment No. 147 would ensure that where non-agricultural activity occurs, the relevant commons associations have a right to be consulted. Commons associations are sometimes ignored in that respect, as are individual commoners where no commons association exists. That certainly occurred as regards a case I mentioned on an earlier Committee day where a golf course was constructed on common land without consultation. The matter took five years to resolve. So there are very live issues here.
</p>

<a name="51102-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>I turn to the government Amendment No. 142, which strikes out the subsections that refer to agricultural activities and the promotion of sustainable agriculture. I would prefer the concept of sustainable agriculture to remain in the Bill provided it is properly defined. However, it is not, and that matter has been commented on. Instead the Government have tabled Amendment No. 142, which is a worthy inclusion.
</p>

<a name="51102-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The only query I have concerns paragraph (b) of government Amendment No. 142, which refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;the management of vegetation on the land&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Does that change the commons association&#039;s functions in that it would involve management advice on aspects which are non-agricultural? There is a circle here that has to be squared as between what constitutes competent agricultural management, for example, regarding stocking rates, and the whole issue of conservation. We need to examine whether a conflict arises in that regard or whether the spirit of Amendment No. 146 tabled by my noble friend Lady Miller&#151;which concerns the sustainable management of common land&#151;encapsulates the issues in Amendment No. 142 which I am discussing.

<a name="51102-33_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I listened with great interest to the debate.

prescription is having an absolutely clear idea of what you want to achieve. Trying to balance agriculture with environmental benefits is extremely difficult. I have tried to do that for many years. I have tried to reach a balance in the conflict between maintaining heather moorland for grouse shooting and the contrary interests of sheep farming. It is extremely difficult. The only way one can achieve that is by having a clear definition of what one wants to do and a management prescription which fits that.
</p>

<a name="51102-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Having said that and having looked at the various amendments, I believe that on balance the Minister has the matter right. Government Amendment No. 142 is sufficiently flexible to be able to respond to whatever management prescription is ultimately decided is best for the common in question. When I first looked at the amendment I was a little concerned by the wording of paragraph (a) which states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;the management of agricultural activities on the land for which the association is established&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I thought that was a little too prescriptive. However, paragraph (b), which refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;the management of vegetation on the land&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>embraces the concept of flexibility, which is the name of the game. On balance, that is probably the right way forward. However, this is a difficult matter on which I will never reach a firm conclusion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="51102-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I put it on record that on balance I agree with what the noble Earl, Lord Peel, has just said. I welcome government Amendment No. 142 for the reasons that the Minister and Members of the Committee set out.
</p>

<a name="51102-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>I make two points on the group of amendments that we are discussing. The first concerns the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Tyler which refers to access. It was useful to raise that matter at this stage. One of the interesting things about this Bill is its almost complete lack of reference to access. One can only assume that the Government believe that the references to access and common land in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act are sufficient and that nothing further needs to be stated in this Bill in that regard. It would be helpful if the Minister confirmed that that is the Government&#039;s view.
</p>

<a name="51102-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The Minister kindly referred to me as an expert on the CROW Act earlier today. I have to say that the longer I am a Member of this House, the less time I have to be an expert on anything. We do our best with whatever comes before us. Perhaps we become experts after things have left us and the process is over, when it is too late. On the matter of access and common land, by definition, all common land is access land in the CROW Act, subject to exceptions and so on. Recreational users of access land clearly have rights and responsibilities as set out in the CROW Act, as do landowners and tenants.
</p>

<a name="51102-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>What is the position of rights holders&#151;the commoners&#151;on commons? Are they included in the CROW Act as users of the land for grazing purposes or whatever? Is that clearly set out? If it is not, that is an interesting question. If they have rights and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC124"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC124</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

responsibilities on a par with those of landowners and tenants, should the commons associations, which will comprise mainly of commoners in many cases, have, as part of their responsibilities, the management of the aspects of access which refer to the commoners as individuals? As I understand it, the purpose of commons associations is to get a collective operation going, instead of individual commoners having a right to graze their animals, or whatever else they do, in an individual way. Should not the management of access be part of the duties or the powers of commons associations?
</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="51102-33_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Is the noble Lord seriously saying that he expects a grazier on a common to take access considerations into account when he is grazing and looking after his animals? If the noble Lord is saying that, he is living in a rather different world from the real world up on the fells.
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="51102-33_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   I am asking the question, rather than saying anything. There is clearly an interaction between sheep and other animals grazing and people like me walking on uplands. There is clearly an interaction, which is what the CROW Act is about. Landowners and people grazing animals clearly have rights and responsibilities in relation to that. I am merely asking whether the commons association, as a collective body, ought to be involved. I am not saying that individual commoners should have responsibility necessarily, but that the commons association should. I think that that is the real world.
</p>

<a name="51102-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>I welcome the amendment moved by my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. I, too, want to raise the issue of wildlife on the common. There are two sides to that, including the obvious problem of rabbits in many places. The noble Earl, Lord Peel, might refer to foxes and other animals&#151;I do not know. But the management of wildlife on the common is required in order to prevent that wildlife becoming a nuisance. In some places, there might be the promotion of wildlife on the common; for example, as a tourist facility or for conservation reasons. All sorts of animals that used to exist in this country, such as, beavers, even wolves&#151;some people question that&#151;wild boar and all sorts of animals, and birds, are being re-introduced. Surely, that is part of the management of the common, in addition to the management of vegetation. As my noble friend suggested, should not the wording reflect that?

<a name="51102-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   I hope I have not got this wrong, but in Amendment No. 142, which the Minister introduced and for which he should be congratulated, he puts paragraph (a) in front of paragraph (b): that is the management of agricultural activities on the land, for which the association is established, in front of the management of vegetation on the land. I wonder if that indicates that the management of agricultural activities has preference over the management of vegetation.

favourable condition, it may well conceive that the vegetation in some cases is more important than agricultural activities and, therefore, there could be a conflict. Indeed, I think we will talk about this, although not quite in the same way, on the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill when we will be talking about conflict resolution clauses. Can the Minister indicate which is more important?
</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="51102-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   This is a very interesting debate on a very interesting topic. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, was typically modest about his amendments. I do not know if he will forgive me if I do not give my full rebuttal, as it is called, of all the points. I do not think he made them all because he gave way on his amendments to those who spoke later. The issue of the CROW Act appeared in what he had to say and also in what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, had to say. Let me try to answer those issues. We believe that the CROW Act provides a full regime for managing access to commons with local restrictions where necessary and access management by the local authority. We do not want the Bill to confuse the issue by cutting across those arrangements. I think that that is a sensible approach.
</p>




<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="51102-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   I am very grateful to the Minister. Is he saying that the association will not even have a right to be consulted on those issues? If that is the case, it would be a grave weakness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="51102-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The noble Lord interrupted at exactly the right moment. That is perhaps the result of years of practice in another place. Our view is that the commons association is unrepresentative as far as the CROW Act is concerned. To manage access fairly, it would need representation from local authorities, the users groups and others, which would complicate the arrangements greatly. Commons owners can apply under CROW for restrictions where necessary and it would not be the intention not to allow commons associations to be consulted. They would have a say, but their role in decisions under CROW would be limited. I think that is the best I can do on that topic for the moment.
</p>

<a name="51102-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>I came to Amendment No. 145, which was spoken to by the noble Baroness. It would give the purposes of commons associations precedence over all other enactments relating to common land. Our position is that common land is a shared resource. It is important for different reasons to a range of people. There may be multiple uses by different interests based on a range of rights in the common. Our concern is to ensure that a commons association can manage the vegetation, common rights and agricultural activity on common land while acknowledging the rights of other interests. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, that I have already changed around paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), which is probably an answer to his question, but I shall come to it in moment. The users of a common need to continue to rub along together as they always have. Generally speaking, that works well. We do not want to tamper with that balance. For that reason we resist <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC126"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC126</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Amendment No. 145. I am very glad to repeat, on the record, that I believe, as do the Government, that commercial productive agriculture is a very significant and important aspect of the countryside.

</p>

<a name="51102-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 146 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. Sustainable management is a very broad concept and could encompass a large number of activities on a common. Examples range from recreational activities to nature conservation and landscape management. That creates the potential for too much conflict as interests may vary in what is understood to constitute &quot;sustainable management&quot;. It is also true that in many cases members of the association may not have the skills or the resources to manage commons for purposes other than those related to management of agriculture and vegetation. After much thought, we decided to limit the management functions that can be granted to an association.
</p>

<a name="51102-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, spoke to Amendment No. 147. Most commons are used by a variety of people for different purposes. The resources are shared between different owners, interests and rights holders. Non-agricultural activities often take place on commons as a result of those different interests which have to live together. It would be unfair on both parties&#151;the commons association and the interest engaged in a non-agricultural activity&#151;to require a consultation process each time some non-agricultural activity is to occur.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="51102-34_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   A big issue that has not yet arisen is the increase in what I would describe as extreme sports as a result of technological breakthroughs and so forth. They are other activities that occur. I think that commons associations have a view on that, and I will say no more than that at this stage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="51102-34_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   Before I turn to the noble Earl&#039;s amendment, I shall return briefly to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, on fencing, which relates to establishing and maintaining boundaries under Clause 30(3)(d). The power to establish and maintain fences is, on balance, needed. There may, in some areas, be a custom that owners adjoining a common should fence against it, but that is probably not always a hard-and-fast rule. An association may need to manage fences where the owner of the adjoining land is not maintaining an effective fence, which is why that is in subsection (3).
</p>

<a name="51102-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Amendment No. 142A, moved by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, would remove the capacity for the national authority to grant any functions relating to the management of vegetation and agricultural activities to commons associations. They would be replaced with functions relating to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;the maintenance of good agricultural and environmental condition&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Our feeling is that the amendment would have the effect of narrowing the range of functions that could be granted to a commons association. It would allow an association to engage in functions relating only to the management of common rights, and,
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51102-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Where active agriculture is taking place the majority of farmers are in receipt of single farm payment money. That already requires them to comply with a range of regulations&#151;the noble Lord knows them well&#151;to keep the land in good agricultural and environmental condition. They also apply to common land. We wish commons associations to be able to go further than that and manage the exercise of the rights of all those who are engaged in agricultural activity on the common. It is not clear that the noble Lord&#039;s carefully worded amendment would allow this.
</p>

<a name="51102-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>In particular, by way of example, it would not permit the management of the vegetation of common land for purposes other than agriculture. That is one of the prime reasons for our amendment, as it does allow commons associations to be established to manage lowland commons where no agriculture activity is currently occurring. If I was in any doubt about whether the Government were right in their Amendment No. 142, the support on this occasion of both the noble Earl, Lord Peel, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, makes me more confident than I would otherwise have been that we must be right.
</p>

<a name="51102-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The remaining matter is the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick. There is no preference between (a), (b) and (c) in subsection (1) of our amendment. We can pick and choose between all three.
</p>




<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="51102-34_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I thank the Minister for his comments on our contributions. Will he confirm&#151;I think he nearly did&#151;that the facilities within the CROW Act will be dealt with equally? Or do they take precedence over what is proposed in his amendment? The management rights of common land are enormously important. We have talked about sheep, but one could talk equally about wildlife and birds, which is a hugely important topic. When we were taking the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill through&#151;he will be thankful that he was not here to sit for the hours that we sat on that Bill&#151;that was one of the big debating points. I hope that some of the wildlife groups realise why we fought carefully to try to have a balance between access and the protection of breeding and other issues which are essential if wildlife is to be established and do well.
</p>

<a name="51102-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>I did not hear in his answer whether the two measures will sit side by side or one will take precedence. Not today, but later, we will need to give thought to how we can ensure that the freedoms that come with access&#151;which I know people will enjoy and use, because that is what it is about&#151;do not lead people to act detrimentally as regards those who work the land or belong to the commons associations. So it is not just about sheep or horses but also about the greater wildlife and how these two measures can sit side by side and operate successfully within the same ambit.

<a name="column_GC128"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column GC128</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

having the debate instigated by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on progress on the access provisions under the CROW Act, I asked the Minister whether he was satisfied with the level of research being done to establish whether there was any impact on ground-nesting birds from the access provisions under the legislation. I think that the noble Lord said that he would write to me, but he has not done so. I also asked him whether any forthcoming reports would be published in the public domain. So my noble friend has given me the opportunity to jog the noble Lord&#039;s memory. I will be grateful if he can respond in due course.
</p>




<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="51102-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   If I have not responded to the noble Earl, I apologise. Let me try to respond to the noble Baroness.

<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="51102-35_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I know that it is late, so I will not press the matter. Perhaps the Minister and his team can look at it again before we return on Report.

<a name="51102-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   I think that I have answered the noble Baroness, but I will try and do so again. I made it clear in both the answers I gave that this Bill does not affect or change CROW. In other words, the rights of access that are allowed under the CROW Act still stand, even when the Bill becomes an Act. That is the answer: CROW prevails.
</p>

<a name="51102-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>I failed to answer a question about horses. There is doubt about whether &quot;livestock&quot; includes horses and ponies. The noble Earl was quick enough to pick up on our Amendments Nos. 153 and 155, which clear up this doubt. We now call them &quot;animals&quot; and not &quot;livestock&quot;. Apparently that gets over the problem.

<p><a name="st_170"></a>
<a name="51102-35_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   It would be useful for Members of the Committee to know whether the Minister has taken enough comfort from the fact that the noble Earl, Lord Peel, and my noble friend Lord Greaves agree with him. Therefore, is he satisfied with the introduction to Clause 30 that his amendment proposes, or is he still open to further suggestions of improvement between now and Report?
</p>




<p><a name="st_171"></a>

back and trying to persuade us otherwise. Of course, we are open for consultation and discussion at any time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_172"></a>
<a name="51102-35_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   Just because I think that the Government are largely right on this provision, it does not mean that it cannot be improved. Things can always be improved. I am reluctant to pursue the matter of access because in general the fewer restrictions there are, the happier I am. I am really looking at the rights of people grazing their animals on a common as commoners.
</p>

<a name="51102-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>We need to get the issue of 28-day closures clear. If I have the tenancy or ownership of a piece of land, I am entitled to close that piece of land, even if it is access land, for up to 28 days a year, subject to all the other bits and pieces, such as not weekends and, if I remember rightly, not Christmas Day. If I am grazing my sheep on that piece of land because it is a common, I am a commoner and I can graze my sheep, do I have the same rights to apply for 28-day closure? If I do not as an individual&#151;despite the fact that I am against 28-day closures as a matter of principle&#151;it seems to me that the appropriate body that should be exercising that right is the commons association on behalf of the commoners collectively. If there are six commoners all grazing their sheep on the same bit of land, it is difficult for one of them to exercise those rights. If the commons association exists, there is a body that can do it. The Minister has accepted that in other aspects the commons association can express its views. It is not clear whether it will be consulted specifically, but it can express its views on matters like anybody else. That is the first question.
</p>

<a name="51102-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Secondly, I do not think that the Minister&#151;unless I went to sleep for 20 seconds&#151;answered the question about wildlife. I got a bit carried away with beavers and wolves and so on, so let us talk about ground-nesting birds, which were raised by the noble Earl, Lord Peel. One particular example is lapwings&#151;or chewits, as they used to call them in our part of the world. We all know that the main reason for the catastrophic decline in the number of lapwings in many moorland upland areas has been the improvement of pastures, particularly the pastures which surround the moorland where so many of the nests used to be.
</p>

<a name="51102-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>The Minister may say that the management of the vegetation is covered, but management of the vegetation for the purpose of encouraging more Lapwings on the common, for example, might be something that people locally want to do, or are persuaded to do, or they can get grants to do and so on. In appropriate places the commons association should be involved in that decision. If it is managing the common, surely the future of ground-nesting birds that use the common&#151;whether lapwings, golden <br>&nbsp;<br>

plovers, skylarks or whatever&#151;should be a legitimate part of its activities. We would like some assurance on that.

</p>




<p><a name="st_173"></a>
<a name="51102-35_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   On 28-day closures, my advice is that commoners do not have that power; it is a power either for the owner or the owner&#039;s tenant. The commoner cannot use the 28-day closure privilege. So that is not likely to arise.
</p>

<a name="51102-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Our experience is that the CROW Act arrangements for protecting wildlife have so far proved successful in practice. As regards the noble Lord&#039;s example of managing vegetation for lapwings, a commons association could be given that sort of function. I hope that helps him&#151;to some extent at least.

<a name="51102-35_spnew8"></a><b> The Earl of Caithness: </b>   I am sure the Committee is grateful for the very full and detailed replies the Minister has given. We seem to be edging towards a common agreement, but I still think that there are particular points which need addressing. I am not sure that Report stage will be the right forum in which they can be addressed because we can speak only once. Will the Minister consider, in his normal generous way, having a meeting or two between now and another stage in which these points can be discussed so that we get agreement, rather than doing so on the Floor of the House where discussion is much more structured from the next stage on?

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="51102-36_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (John Reid) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I am pleased to announce that I have appointed Lord Young of Norwood Green for a three-year term of office as a member of the Armed Forces&#039; Pay Review Body commencing March 2006. This appointment has been conducted in accordance with the guidance of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.

<a name="51102-36_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Gateways to the Professions</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="51102-36_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education (Bill Rammell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>As stated in my Written Statement to Parliament on 20 July, I am able to inform the House that the Secretary of State for Education and Skills has today published Sir Alan Langlands&#039; report examining the gateways to the professions, along with the Government&#039;s response.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>Sir Alan Langlands was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Charles Clarke) last year, following the debate on the Higher Education Bill, to act as an independent person to oversee the report. The announcement about his appointment and the terms of reference was made in a Statement to the House on 12 February 2004. Sir Alan was asked to examine how the public sector and the professions can sustain and improve recruitment opportunities for graduates, especially those who do not qualify for the full &#163;3,000 support that will be available in grants and bursaries under our plans to introduce variable fees from 2006. He was asked to put forward recommendations on actions that can be taken by employing organisations to provide clear and accessible gateways for all graduates who want to pursue such careers and which will benefit the recruitment needs of these sectors.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>In welcoming Sir Alan&#039;s report and its recommendations, I would stress that there has never been a better time for students from poorer backgrounds to enter higher education. We expect that 55 per cent of all new full time students will qualify for a full or partial grant, and further help will be available by way of bursaries from higher education institutions. This means that the poorest students will have a minimum of &#163;3,000 in non repayable support.

</p>

<a name="51102-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>In accepting Sir Alan&#039;s recommendations we are also supporting the strong sense of partnership which he wishes to encourage. We will therefore create a development fund to carry work forward across the recommendations. Up to &#163;6 million will be made available over the next three years to support collaborative projects in the key areas suggested by Sir Alan.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>We have also committed to the establishment of a forum for sharing and developing recruitment and retention strategies. The forum will be key in helping to take forward Sir Alan&#039;s recommendations and in addressing the issues raised in his report.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>Copies of the report and the Government&#039;s response are available in the Libraries of both Houses.

<a name="51102-36_head2"></a><h3 align=center>Government Technology Strategy</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="51102-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has today laid before Parliament the <i>Strategy for Transformational Government Enabled by Technology </i>(Cm 6683).
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>The strategy describes the opportunity provided by technology to transform the business of government and how that opportunity might be seized. The strategy was commissioned by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to provide overall technology leadership for government in three areas: first, the transformation of public services for the benefit of citizens, businesses, taxpayers and front-line staff; secondly, the efficiency of the corporate services and infrastructure of government organisations, thus freeing resources for the front-line; thirdly, the steps necessary to achieve more professional and effective delivery of technology-enabled business change within government.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The strategy focuses on the core themes that each public sector organisation needs to develop into actions for its area of responsibility, and on the supporting actions to be taken across government as a whole.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>Copies of the strategy have been placed in the Library. A full set of supporting material is available via the Cabinet Office website at www.cio.gov.uk. The Government have invited comments on the strategy by 3 February 2006.

<a name="51102-36_head4"></a><h3 align=center>Judicial Diversity Programme</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="51102-36_spmin3"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  Following my Written Statement of 13 July this year, I am now announcing further progress on my programme of work to increase the diversity of the judiciary, and my plans for the coming months.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Achieving a more diverse judiciary is one of my key priorities. Public confidence in the justice system requires that our judges continue to be of the highest quality, appointed solely on merit following a rigorous selection process. To be confident that we continue to appoint the best, we need to draw on the widest possible pool of those with the right skills and qualities. This means reaching out to a wider range of potential candidates. A judiciary which comprises a range of experiences and perspectives will continue to be in touch with the communities it serves.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>Since July, my department has made substantial progress in our work to encourage a wider range of people to apply for judicial appointment by improving the information offered to potential candidates. In particular:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>The launch today of a new booklet, <i>Step up to a Judicial Career</i>, and an accompanying DVD;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>A new leaflet about judicial appointments aimed at encouraging students to consider judicial appointment as part of a legal career;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>Continuation of our programme of information events, with invaluable help from growing numbers of judicial &quot;role models&quot;;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>Growing numbers of participants in our Work Shadowing Scheme, with extremely positive feedback;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_7"></a>Piloting a scheme to encourage members of under-represented groups to apply for specific appointments;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_8"></a>Increased uptake of our e-newsletter&#151;there are now well over a thousand regular recipients;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_9"></a>The launch today of a new judicial diversity page on the department&#039;s website, and improved accessibility to the site&#039;s information about judicial appointments;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_10"></a>Commissioning research on barriers to appointment perceived by women and black and minority ethnic lawyers&#151;I expect to publish full results early in 2006.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51102-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>There is still much to do. There is an untapped pool of potential judicial talent, particularly among solicitors, and my department, in partnership with the Law Society, is looking at how that might be harnessed. There is little point, however, in encouraging people to apply for appointment if judicial life itself is difficult to fit in with domestic commitments. I have already taken action to address this issue: many salaried judges are now able to work part-time, and I recently approved the appointment of the first-ever job-share arrangement for a salaried <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS18"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column WS18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

post. I expect much of our work in the coming months to focus on making the judicial role better suited to a more diverse judiciary.

</p>

<a name="51102-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>I am therefore introducing a career break scheme for the judiciary, to assist judges in accommodating personal responsibilities, commitments or outside interests. Further details, including the commencement date, will be announced shortly, but I expect the scheme to be up and running early in the new year.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>I believe that permitting judges to return to legal practice after they cease to hold judicial office would have a significant impact on diversity by encouraging a more diverse range of people to consider applying for judicial appointment. Changing current policy to permit return to practice would encourage lawyers to consider judicial office earlier in their careers. I am minded to go ahead with this change for judges below High Court level, but before making a final decision I will ask the Judges&#039; Council for its views on the matter. I shall also need to consider what conditions and safeguards should apply where judges do return to practice, and whether it would also be appropriate to permit those who have served at the level of High Court judge and above to return to practice. I expect to consult stakeholders on these issues in the near future.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>My department is also taking forward work to reduce or remove altogether barriers faced by disabled judges and potential candidates. Finally, because I believe it is important for judges to be able to progress over time to more senior judicial posts, I am launching a pilot scheme in the north-east whereby circuit judges will act as mentors to district judges who wish to consider applying for a more senior post. Mentors will be identified and trained over the coming months.
</p>

<a name="51102-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>This package of improvements will complement the steps already taken in recent months to increase the diversity of the judiciary, and will provide the new Judicial Appointments Commission with a solid base on which to build when it starts work next April.

<a name="51102-37_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Low Carbon Buildings Programme</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="51102-37_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>The Low Carbon Buildings Capital Grant Programme (LCBP) will be allocated &#163;30 million, to be spent over three years. It will replace the Clear Skies and Major PV Demonstration programmes.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>I aim to launch the LCBP by April 2006. &#163;1.5 million of the funding package will be brought forward to allow further funding for the two existing programmes, in order to help transition to the new programme.

</p>

<a name="51102-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>The LCBP will be designed to take a holistic approach to reducing carbon emissions by using innovative combinations of microgeneration technologies and energy efficiency measures.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS19"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column WS19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51102-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>As well as continuing to fund single installations, the programme will focus on supporting large scale developments in the public and private sectors to act as exemplars and encourage further projects. Potential community beneficiaries could include schools, leisure centres or even remote villages that are not connected to the grid. Other projects could include housing estates or business parks. The focus on larger developments is designed to engage the construction sector more widely and to help push microgeneration products further down the road towards commercial viability.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>This grant programme is just one part of the Government&#039;s strategy to promote microgeneration, which will aim to remove those barriers currently hindering the development of a sustainable market for these products.

<a name="51102-37_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Northern Ireland: Community-based Restorative Justice</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_7"></a>
<a name="51102-37_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland (David Hanson) has made the following Ministerial Statement.

</p>

<a name="51102-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>The Government have been seeking to develop guidelines to give effect to the recommendation in the review of the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland relating to community-based restorative justice (rec. 168). The review recommended that community-based restorative justice schemes could have a role to play in dealing with the types of low-level crime that most commonly concern local communities, subject to a number of conditions and safeguards. These were that such schemes should:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_11"></a>receive referrals from a statutory criminal justice agency, rather than from within the community, with the police being informed of all such referrals;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_12"></a>be accredited by and subject to standards laid down by the Government in respect of how they deal with criminal activity, covering such issues as training of staff, human rights protections, other due process and proportionality issues, and complaints mechanisms for both victims and offenders;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_13"></a>be subject to regular inspection by the independent Criminal Justice Inspectorate; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_14"></a>have no role in determining the guilt or innocence of alleged offenders, and deal only with those individuals referred by a criminal justice agency who have indicated that they do not wish to deny guilt and where there is prima facie evidence of guilt.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="51102-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>In line with the review, there is no question of the Government approving a two tier system. The guidelines will unambiguously specify the involvement of the police and other statutory criminal justice organisations in the operation of the community-based schemes. That is why the work on the guidelines is being taken forward by a group including <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS20"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column WS20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

representatives of the PSNI, the Public Prosecution Service, the Probation Board for Northern Ireland and the Youth Justice Agency as well as officials from my department. The group has been in contact with the community-based schemes about the guidelines and aims to complete the current round of discussions with them by around 30 November 2005. Following that, I plan in December to circulate the guidelines to the main political parties in Northern Ireland as well as to the policing board and other key stakeholders for comment. I would expect this process to be completed in the New Year, when decisions will be taken on the way forward.

<a name="51102-37_head2"></a><h3 align=center>Women and Pensions</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_8"></a>
<a name="51102-37_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (David Blunkett) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>I have today published <i>Women and Pensions: the Evidence</i>, a compendium of statistics and analysis examining in detail the key influences on the level of women&#039;s retirement income. The report has been placed in the Library and copies are available to honourable Members from the Vote Office.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>The report clearly shows that inequalities of income in retirement cannot be tackled in isolation from inequality during working life. The Government are committed to a holistic approach that develops social and labour market policies hand-in-hand. In this way we can tackle the gap in pay, income and assets and break the glass-ceiling for progression through working-life, as well as address the historically deep divide in retirement income which has been a product of a system predicated on a 1940s world where women were seen as dependent on their husbands.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>Since 1997 we have made significant progress in redeeming past inequality of income. Two-thirds of the 1.3 million workers benefiting from the national minimum wage are women and the UK now has the highest female employment rate of the major EU countries, with the gender pay gap at its lowest point for 30 years. Two-thirds of pension credit recipients are women and the UK pension system is today delivering better average retirement incomes than any   previous generation has ever enjoyed&#151;with 1.9 million lifted out of absolute poverty since 1997, 1.3 million of whom are women.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>However, as today&#039;s report makes clear, in 2005 only 30 per cent of women reach state pension age entitled to a full basic state pension compared with 85   per cent of men. Only 24 per cent of women reaching state pension age are entitled to a full basic state pension on the basis of their own contributions, and only 17 per cent are actually in receipt of a full basic state pension based on these contributions.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>New figures from the Government Actuary&#039;s Department contained in this report show that by 2025 women are projected to have caught up with men and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS21"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column WS21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

both should be reaching age 65 with similar basic state pensions. This is good news but is far from the full picture. Only 38 per cent of today&#039;s working age women are contributing to a private pension and at present retired men receive on average &#163;50 to &#163;100 a week more than women of the same age.

</p>

<a name="51102-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>Saving for retirement is also affected by household activities and attitudes. Child care continues to be predominantly done by women. Elder care is more evenly split but the difference is still significant&#151;27 per cent of women and 19 per cent of men aged 45&#150;64 care for another adult. Time spent out of the labour market has an effect on the ability of women to build up a retirement income. This is particularly important given that many women perceive pensions to be associated with paid employment and therefore not applicable to them.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>Furthermore, within every ethnic group, women are less likely than men to have private pension provision <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS22"></a>

<b>2 Nov 2005 : Column WS22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and there are currently no foreseeable national changes to the pattern of labour market participation for ethnic minority women to suggest a significant change to their pension accrual rates.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>The comprehensive evidence in this report will inform our ongoing national pensions debate and in particular support the specific Women and Pensions Conference we are hosting in Manchester on Monday 7 November. It will feed into the final stages of the Pension Commission&#039;s work on its own report and it will underpin our subsequent response that will shape the future of retirement provision in the UK.
</p>

<a name="51102-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>I would like to thank honourable Members and noble Lords who have campaigned and developed the case for lasting change and who have worked with us to develop a renewed focus on this crucial issue of equality. I hope that all Members will join me in building on this evidence to put fairer outcomes for women at the heart of our consensus for a long-term solution to the pensions challenge.

</p>

<a name="51102w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>&quot;Since January 2004, there have been over 50 human deaths in Asia confirmed as resulting from bird flu (also known as avian flu and avian influenza).

</p>

<a name="51102w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>The current travel advice and avian influenza fact sheet are available on the FCO website at www.fco.gov.uk.

<a name="51102w03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Managing attendance is a key priority within Northern Ireland departments and there is a comprehensive range of policies and procedures in place, aimed at helping and supporting staff throughout their illness. These include access to professional help and support while absent from work, and assistance with rehabilitation and any reasonable adjustments to ease a return to work. Considerable importance is also placed on trying to prevent staff going off ill by offering a range of health promotion activities and advice, and encouraging a work life balance.

<p><a name="wa_st_26"></a>
<a name="51102w04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   There were an estimated 47,300 surplus places in schools in Northern Ireland in 2004&#150;05. Of these, 31,600 were in primary schools and 15,700 were in post primary schools.
</p>

<a name="51102w04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_23"></a>Funding is provided to schools from the education budget mainly on the basis of the numbers and characteristics of the pupils attending rather than on the capacity of the school. Estimates for the overall costs of surplus capacity in classrooms are not available.
</p>

<a name="51102w04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a>Surplus places are removed from the estate through closures and amalgamations, and through the capital programme when buildings are replaced. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland with responsibility for education has highlighted to the Education and Library Boards and the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools the need to take action to tackle surplus places and offered financial support towards the costs of speeding up rationalisation proposals. Following a review of the procurement and delivery arrangements for the schools&#039; estate earlier this year the department has also been examining how to improve the planning of school provision in future, including the need for rationalisation.

Both documents are available in the Library.

<a name="51102w04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a>If a &quot;multicultural strategy&quot; means one which encourages cultural separatism, then clearly that is not the answer.

<a name="51102w04_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Riparian owners are responsible for the maintenance of watercourses which are not designated by the Drainage Council for Northern Ireland. Some 6,800 kilometres of watercourses in Northern Ireland are already designated and maintained by Rivers Agency as necessary to ensure free flow. These are essentially watercourses where maintenance is beyond the capability of riparian owners and where intervention by Rivers Agency provides value for money. In the case of the undesignated watercourses, the agency may require riparian owners to undertake maintenance, with the possibility of prosecution for non-compliance. I consider that these arrangements are adequate and have no plans to bring forward legislation to transfer responsibility for the maintenance of all watercourses to central government. To do so would divert resources from essential flood protection schemes to protect life and property.
