<a name="60116-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Somalia</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Avebury </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether they will propose that the United Nations Security Council should now take steps to restore lawful government in Somalia; and, if so, what steps they propose should be taken.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, we support the efforts of the United Nations and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development to restore government to Somalia. They have achieved the Somali National Reconciliation Conference, the establishment of the Transitional Federal Parliament and the election of the speaker, president and government. The process remains fragile but offers the best prospect for peace and we shall continue to support it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the achievements that he has mentioned date back 15 months and that the persons who were then appointed to govern Somalia have left it to the mercy of terrorists and pirates? In view of the fact that the meetings now being held, or to be held, in Aden and Nairobi are between those same individuals, how can we have any faith in the process? Does the Minister agree that the Security Council should have a fallback plan in case the faction leaders fail to come to an agreement that enables the government to be properly installed in Mogadishu?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, whatever the difficulties, in our view the best prospect for restoring governance to Somalia requires that the Security Council remains the body responsible for the peace process. Resolutions and presidential statements over the past year have demonstrated the commitment. The concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, are well founded. The Transitional Federal Parliament has been slow to engage with the Mogadishu-based Ministers and it has been ambiguous on the ceasefire and the national security plan, all of which are central to the United Nations&#039; plan. However, I can see no sensible alternatives at the moment&#151;although some have been proposed&#151;to the hard work that is going on to achieve the plan.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I have two related questions for the Minister. I believe that the World Food Programme has so far about a quarter of what it needs for the starving people in southern <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_418"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 418</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Somalia. What contribution are HMG making to that? Have they moved beyond the 25 per cent volume needed, up to the full 64,000 tonnes of food required, for the starving in southern Somalia? Can the Minister also say something about the apparent smuggling of weapons through Ethiopia into Somalia, possibly at the instigation of Italian operators, which is prolonging the fighting and ensuring that, despite 13 attempts to get governance in the past 14 years, the next attempt is going to be difficult as well?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I am aware of no direct evidence of Italian weapons being smuggled in that way. However, during the course of our presidency, we urged the Italians to take seriously their responsibilities to work together with all other European Union nations in achieving peace. They have had somewhat different policies in one or two key respects. On assistance, we intend to provide up    to &#163;13 million to Somalia in the financial year    2005&#150;06. We contributed &#163;420,000 to the reconciliation process and we are also providing assistance to the   UN development programme to support the government&#039;s relocation to Somalia and the humanitarian relief operations. We shall provide more, if it is credible to do so, to a government who are properly established.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, on piracy, can the Minister say how many vessels were hijacked off the coast of Somalia in 2005? Is not the Kenyan navy trying to do what it can to solve this problem, and should it not have the support of the Security Council by a resolution endorsing its use of armed force where necessary, under Chapter 7 of the charter?
</p>

<a name="60116-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Do the Government not think that Somaliland deserves rewarding in some way for being an oasis of stability and peace in the region which has recently demonstrated its commitment to democracy in holding successful parliamentary elections?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I cannot give precise figures for the incidents of piracy. However, as I understand it, some have been reported to a recent conference in Jakarta, and a ministerial summit is to take place in Tokyo this month so that proper attention from the G8 and the international community can be given to dealing with it. The International Maritime Organisation has drafted a resolution, which its secretary-general will submit to the United Nations Secretary-General in 2006, although we do not yet have a specified date.
</p>

<a name="60116-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Briefly, we are working very closely with Somaliland. Short of full recognition, we are encouraging Somaliland and its stability. We have taken the view&#151;and I hope the House will agree&#151;that rather than see further fragmentation, it is crucial that the African nations themselves take the lead on any further recognition of independent entities.

<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Blaker </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether they will put forward proposals for a reduction in the number of European Union Commissioners.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, the Government have no plans to put forward proposals for a reduction in the number of EU Commissioners but keep under review the scope for making reform proposals across a whole range of EU issues. As the Prime Minister said throughout the UK presidency, debate on the future direction of the EU needs to focus on maximising its effectiveness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Blaker: </b>   My Lords, are not the 25 Commissioners who now exist several more than are needed? Is it not reasonable to fear that they might feel it necessary to justify their existence by issuing more directives and regulations? We have had a torrent of such things under the 15 Commissioners. That has spread the feeling among many people that the European Union is interfering too much in their lives and has spread disillusionment. May it not be even worse under 25 Commissioners?
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, there are probably only a finite number of hours in the day when 15 or 25 people can issue directives. There is a probably a law in physics, although I am not aware of it, which brings that number to a natural limit. It is not the current number of Commissioners that potentially creates problems. There is, and remains, a very good case for ensuring that directives are proportionate and come forward only in areas where they genuinely add value. I would urge that on 15 Commissioners&#151;or a smaller number, were there to be a smaller number&#151;just as I would on 25.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Tomlinson: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that it is unfair to blame the Commissioners for the issuing, as the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, said, of directives or regulations. The Commission merely issues drafts. If there is any culpability for bad legislation in Europe, it lies not with the Commission, but with the Council of Ministers which adopts it. I hope my noble friend will confirm that Her Majesty&#039;s Government will resist bad legislation in their legislative role on the Council of Ministers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend. Responsibility lies, in the final analysis, at exactly the level that he describes. We can make a commitment to ensure that the legislation introduced is genuinely needed, and not legislation that could be dealt with perfectly adequately at a UK level.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Williamson of Horton: </b>   My Lords, is not this a question of, as they say in the Foreign Office, <i>d&#233;j&#224; vu</i>? It has, as far as I am aware, been part of UK <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_420"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 420</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

government policy for many years, and many intergovernmental conferences, that it would be preferable on grounds of efficiency and good allocation of portfolios to have a smaller Commission, but other member states have not accepted that. It is difficult to see the situation changing if we reopen the matter now, when we have many other important objectives in the European Union.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60116-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I simply agree with the noble Lord. His reflection on the fact that this is <i>d&#233;ja vu </i>reminds me that French is one of the languages of international diplomacy.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60116-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Lord remember that the French Government pressed fairly hard in the early stages of the EU convention for a Commission of 11 or 13 to be selected from among the member governments and that ideas were floated that national governments should be allowed, with the nominated president of the Commission, to choose among the nominees from different member governments, so that we would have both a much more effective college of Commissioners and a much higher general level of competence than there sometimes is from some countries in some situations? I say that tactfully. Could not the British Government keep that proposal alive because we are deeply committed to a more effective Commission as part of a more effective European Union?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, that reminded me at the beginning of the Everly brothers. It had that almost harmonic ring to it. It probably dates us all, but for all that it had a wonderful ring and synchronisation.

</p>

<a name="60116-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>We supported the concept described by the noble Lord. That was in play at one stage and then the notion of one Commissioner per member state came into play with the 25 members. As that has increased to 27 the idea of a rotation system has come into play. I think that it would be of great benefit to keep these matters under review to ensure that the maximum effectiveness and genuine efficiency of the Commission is achieved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </b>   My Lords, is it not true that   the present Commission contains a transport Commissioner whose conviction for financial irregularity was quashed by President Chirac for obvious reasons, an agriculture Commissioner who takes large sums of money from the CAP, several former communist bosses, not to mention our own inimitable Mr Peter Mandelson? Is it not also true that that bunch of rascals has the monopoly of proposing new legislation? Why do we stay in this outfit?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I never cease to be other than astonished at the passionate affection of the noble Lord for the European Union, which shone through so magnificently at that moment. There are people in leading roles, one of two of whom are now <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_421"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 421</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

from the extreme Right of European politics, as well as some whose histories were on the extreme Left. It is a matter for all nation states&#151;including ourselves&#151;to make decisions about who represents them. The arguments for staying in the European Union might detain me longer than is allowed to answer a question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Richard: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend be careful not to be swayed too much by the moderate, measured and sensible tone of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch? His view, as I am sure my noble friend is aware, is that the Commission would function best if it had a membership of zero. Will my noble friend reassure the House that the real problem with the size of the Commission is that other countries have the same view as that of Great Britain&#151;they should have a seat on the chief executive body of the Commission?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, that is absolutely the case, and why I made the point that it was decided to try to represent everybody when there were 25 members. When that reached 27, the extra two members felt exactly the same, and that is why some system of rotation is in place. It may not be the most efficient system but it is certainly the one that chimes    most apparently with national pride   on representation. Perhaps there will be further developments that will improve the efficiency element.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </b>   My Lords, what are the extra 12 Commissioners doing at the moment? How are they spread about?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I do not have the full list of the allocation of responsibilities for all 25 Commissioners. I wish I had. I will make sure that the noble Lord has it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that nothing which is envisaged could be done without causing some offence to some member states? I cannot imagine a situation where anybody would volunteer to reduce the number of Commissioners; can he? Is there not a case at the moment, particularly with the expansion of the European Union, for an in-depth investigation of the role of the Commission and the number of Commissioners, preferably done at European level, but if we cannot do that, at our level as well?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I do not envisage any more than my noble friend does anybody voluntarily stepping back from this body. In the period in which people are reflecting on the consequences of the French and Dutch votes, there are a number of issues where people are bound to have to consider the overall efficiency of the operation of the European Union. In that context, with a bit of luck, there will be a more rational discussion. We have arrived at this position as a result of the unwillingness of national governments to have less authority than each other.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether they propose to make any changes in the payment of the disability living allowance.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  No, my Lords. Disability living allowance will continue to play a vital role in promoting independence and greater equality for disabled people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that rather brief reply. Is he aware that the Government&#039;s insistence on retaining the age bar for this allowance is causing very deep concern among disabled people? It means that those who are disabled and under 65 can claim the allowance and continue to get it after 65, whereas those over 65 are banned from applying and have to make do with the much less valuable attendance allowance. Is my noble friend also aware of the danger that with the progress of the Government&#039;s welfare reforms this age bar may be absorbed and made permanent in the new system? That would be entirely wrong, because the age bar is unfair, unjust and should be abolished.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, I am aware of the points raised by the noble Lord. He is quite right about the operation of the disability living allowance and attendance allowance. This policy has been operated by successive governments. Essentially, the aim of the disability living allowance is to focus additional help with the extra costs of disability on people who have the very considerable disadvantage of being severely disabled early, or relatively early, in life. That is the reason for the difference between the DLA and attendance allowance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Carter: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend said that the DLA is intended to meet the extra costs of disability, irrespective of income. It is not a form of income support. Does he therefore agree that any attempt to means test the DLA would run counter to the whole basis of the benefit?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   Yes, my Lords. My noble friend is right that the DLA is a non-contributory, non-income-related, tax-free benefit and we have no plans to change that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Greengross: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that in a time of increased longevity the Government&#151;and, indeed, all of us&#151;want to encourage older people, whether disabled or able-bodied, to contribute, be independent and work for as long as possible? That is why there are policies for flexible retirement and so on. If one is going to work and is disabled and older, mobility is essential. Does he agree that to qualify for attendance allowance one has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_423"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 423</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to be dependent on some form of care? Therefore, this rigid age bar is unfair and encourages dependence not independence. It is preventing people carrying out government policy. Does he agree that the age bar is absolutely unacceptable in today&#039;s society?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, I cannot agree with the noble Baroness, although I understand her point. I very much sympathise with her point about needing to help older people to be as independent as possible. The fact is that it has been common practice for social security schemes to contain different provisions for people at different stages of their lives, for the whole aim of the disability living allowance was to focus additional help in the way that I have already described.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   My Lords, in the event that the age at which pensions are drawn is raised, does the Minister agree that it would make sense to raise the DLA age bar along with it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60116-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, no doubt that matter will have to be considered when we see the outcome of the Government&#039;s consultation on the Turner commission; we shall come to it when we have that debate.
</p>

<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, the DLA and other benefits are designed to deal with the extra costs that disability can involve. Would it not be more sensible to have a system without brackets, which cut people off and put them into new compartments when they hit a certain age? Most of the costs and conditions will run into each other, especially in a more flexible workplace.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, I understand the noble Lord&#039;s point; I suppose that he is suggesting a wholesale redesign of the entire benefits system. Essentially, the issue about the difference between DLA and AA is also reflected in many other age-related benefit provisions. I am afraid that, at this stage, I cannot give him that undertaking.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Morris of Manchester: </b>   My Lords, we often hear of cases of alleged abuse of the allowance. Can my noble friend say how much went unclaimed by entitled applicants in the past year?

<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, I am afraid that it is not possible to answer that question; it is not possible to calculate take-up rates for DLA or AA because eligibility is not established until entitlement is tested. Since that assessment of eligibility is more complex than for other benefits, it is difficult for me to give a definitive answer to my noble friend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   My Lords, is there not a problem at the other end of the age scale? Has the Minister had a recent report by the Family Fund drawn to his attention? It suggests that average expenditure of families with a <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, there have been a number of reports recently which looked at the costs of disability to families, and not all of them agree.

The Government welcome the ECJ&#039;s judgment in the Marks and Spencer case, which confirmed that our group loss relief rules are in principle compatible with European Community laws except in some exceptional and very limited circumstances. The Government will continue to vigorously defend challenges to our national tax laws brought before the ECJ.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that interesting Answer. I have the greatest respect for the European Court of Justice. However, does my noble friend agree that whereas the Marks and Spencer case confirms the Court&#039;s very wide jurisdiction over commercial and most tax matters, there has been a marked extension of that jurisdiction in recent years? It has now reached even the criminal law although we were assured in 1975 that that would never happen. Do the Government reflect a little on the structure of the Court in that regard, especially when having regard to the fact that of the 22 very distinguished and admirable people appointed as members of the Court since October 2000, a significant proportion of them&#151;some 40 per cent&#151;did not in their previous careers hold posts that led them into senior judicial national areas, regardless of whether you test the meaning of &quot;senior judicial experience&quot; by common law notions or by European civil law notions?

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 425</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

might be an unwarranted extension of law and sanctions by the Commission and by the ECJ. Perhaps the ECJ judgments on criminal penalties is the key to this concern. However, we are clear that it remains the role of member states to determine whether criminal sanctions are necessary and proportionate to enforce a particular rule. In the event that we did not agree with a Commission proposal, we would resist it, and other member states would do the same. Making sure that there is not creep across our domestic law must remain a matter of real concern for all of us.

While the tax regimes of each national member state remain firmly in the hands of each ministry of finance&#151;particularly in regard to corporation tax in this case&#151;is there not now more scope for offsetting capacities between the various member states to give companies maximum scope to offset losses?

<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, whatever scope we decide that we should afford to companies for offsetting losses, it should be determined in the United Kingdom under United Kingdom tax law. I do not see grounds for ceding that to anyone. I accept and agree that the United Kingdom benefits from the fact that the Commission can on occasion propose sanctions under the treaty of the European Community but only where they are necessary and to ensure respect for Community rules. The example which has been cited as illustrating this to best effect is in the area of environmental pollution, where the existence of borders does absolutely nothing on occasions to protect one state from things which have happened in another.

the regulation of taxation? If a British court decided against the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he could come to Parliament and put it right. But is it not the fact that we cannot do that when the European Court of Justice makes a decision against the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the British Parliament?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I think that the control that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Parliament have over the formation of our tax law is very close to absolute. We should see the case that has gone through in the proper context. It was decided that losses could be offset where it was impossible for a company to gain any redress in the country in which it had been trading, but only in very limited circumstances under group tax loss rules. It is easy to exaggerate the impact of the case, but I do not think that it will have any significant impact whatever on the rule-forming of our tax regime or on the Exchequer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </b>   My Lords, do the Government accept that the European Court of Justice is not really a court of law as we understand that expression but rather the engine of the treaties, which require it to find in favour of the ever-closer union and integration of the peoples of Europe, and that furthermore there is no appeal against its judgments, however outrageous they may be?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="60116-03_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   No, my Lords, I do not think that that is the case at all. The Court has a very limited remit&#151;which is, as I said, to determine matters where there are questions about the interpretation of rules that have been decided by political processes in Europe. I do not think that the Court can drive those political processes; it is clear to me that it responds to them.

<p><a name="st_59"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 1, I will speak to the three other amendments in the group, which stand in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Amendment No. 1 returns to the issue of the costs of the ID cards scheme. Our Committee stage was unusual, in that we failed to get any useful information, despite spending several hours on the matter. In fact, our only achievement was to establish with more precision what the Government would not tell us about costs.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>I make no criticism of the Minister. It is clear that she has been operating to a very controlled brief. Her responses in the Chamber and to Written Questions have had a formulaic quality. But I do criticise the Government for imposing this highly restricted brief on the noble Baroness and preventing your Lordships&#039; House gaining a deeper understanding of the costs of the ID scheme.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The Government have been praying in aid commercial confidentiality and have said that to release further information would prejudice their ability to get value for money from procurement. For example, the Minister said in Committee on 19 December at col. 1563 of <i>Hansard</i>:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;no one would dream of bidding lower than our forecast costs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>We simply do not understand this. If the Government are procuring in competitive markets, the bidding behaviour that the noble Baroness describes is simply not credible. I know this, not least from my background as a bidder in the cutthroat market of professional services. We are clearly dealing with a competitive marketplace. The Minister herself said, also on 19 December at col. 1563, that the Government needed to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;secure value in a highly competitive environment&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, </i>19/12/95; col. 1563.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Exactly. It seems that the Government do not believe in the power of competitive markets.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>We believe that it is unprecedented that a Bill with such major consequences for individuals in this country should proceed without Parliament being able to scrutinise the financial consequences. This is so whether the costs are borne by individuals through charging mechanisms or by general taxation. I have not heard the Government offer any precedents for this.

</p>

<a name="60116-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>As I explained in Committee, we on these Benches are mindful that the Government have some degree of manifesto cover for the Bill. In the name of responsible opposition, we have sought a way for the Bill to proceed through your Lordships&#039; House, while also addressing the very real lack of parliamentary scrutiny of costs. That is what the amendments seek to do.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_429"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 429</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Amendment No. 1 is a paving amendment making the powers in the Bill subject to a new clause after Clause 45, which is contained in Amendment No. 123. Subsection (1) of the new clause says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;No provision of this Act, except sections 38, 39 and 45 . . . shall be brought into force until the Secretary of State has laid before Parliament a report in accordance with subsection (2), and that report has been approved by the House of Commons&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I should explain that the references to Clauses 38, 39 and 45 are to allow Clauses 38 and 39, which are not   an intrinsic part of the ID scheme, to be implemented separately.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Subsection (2) goes on to describe the report as containing a cost estimate covering both capital and revenue costs and a statement of expected benefits. These subsections are the heart of the amendment. They give the other place an opportunity to return to the issue of costs and benefits before the Act is brought into effect.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Noble Lords will note that we have carefully confined the power to approve the report on costs and benefits to the other place. We want there to be no suggestion that your Lordships&#039; House is straying beyond its constitutional boundaries.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Subsection (3) of the new clause is rather technical, but ensures that the information on cost makes plain not only annual or revenue costs but also the capital costs. We have received a single figure for annual running costs of &#163;584 million, but we have received no information whatever about capital costs.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Subsection (4) requires the cost estimate to include both actual costs and an estimate going forward for 10 years. The reason is to capture the whole cost of the scheme, from its early days of design and start-up costs&#151;again, about which we have received absolutely no information&#151;through to initial implementation in, say, three years&#039; time, and beyond, to the ongoing operation of the scheme and its transformation into a compulsory scheme. The Minister&#039;s figure of &#163;584 million is only a small slice of the overall picture&#151;it is the big picture that we are trying to see.
<a name="time_5"></a>
<a name="60116-04_time2"></a><h5>3.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60116-04_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Subsection (5) simply asks for the cost estimates to be presented in the format of financial years and subsection (6) makes it clear that the cost estimate covers not only the Home Office but the whole of government.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Noble Lords who have not followed our debates in Committee may be surprised to find that we need to spell this out. The sad fact is that the Minister&#039;s brief has confined her to giving information about the Home Office&#039;s costs alone, and not even all of those, because the Minister has said that the &#163;584 million do not even include the figures for its own immigration service.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>We are clear that we need to see figures for the whole of government, because the benefits that the Government have outlined occur across the whole of government. If Parliament is to get a proper look at <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_430"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 430</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

costs and benefits, we must make sure that it compares apples and oranges&#151;that is, the costs much match the benefits.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Lastly, subsection (7) requires the cost estimate to be reviewed by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I am sure that that assurance will need no explanation.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>We are not seeking today to find out any more information about costs. In early December, before completion of the Committee stage, my noble friend Lady Anelay of St Johns wrote to the Minister offering to place the Committee into a secret session, under Standing Order 15 of your Lordships&#039; House. We could then have discussed the costs in detail without any commercial confidentiality complications. The Government declined. Now that we have reached Report, it is too late for detailed analysis, so I will not today weary the House with the detailed questions that we felt should have been answered.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Let me just put the costs in context. The Government say that the annual running costs are &#163;584 million. That is for one year, starting in late 2008. The London School of Economics report, which came out last June, put the figures over a 10-year period in a range of &#163;10.6 billion to &#163;19.2 billion. If the Home Office&#039;s annual figure of &#163;584 million is representative of costs over 10 years&#151;which is a very big if&#151;we get a total of &#163;5.8 billion. The Government say that the fee for a passport will be &#163;93 and that for an identity card &#163;30. They imply that the fees are driven from the &#163;584 million cost estimate.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>If the LSE report is right, the fee for a passport could actually be between &#163;170 and over &#163;300, and an ID card fee could rise to over &#163;100. The Government have refused to cap fees, so the implication is that if costs rise, so too will fees. There is plenty of research to show that the acceptability of the ID card scheme declines as its cost increases.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The Home Office has produced some analysis in an attempted rebuttal of the LSE&#039;s figures, but the lines of attack have been about a few specific assumptions. There has not been an open and detailed debate between the Home Office and the LSE team. I know that the LSE team regrets this.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Since last summer the LSE team has found some areas where it overestimated costs, but also some areas where it underestimated costs. In the latest report, released over the weekend, it stands by its original estimates in aggregate.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I am sure that the noble Lords will join me in being impressed that Sir Howard Davies, the director of the LSE, has been unswerving in his support of the research team, in the face of some immoderate reactions from the Government.
</p>

<a name="60116-04_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The ID scheme is surrounded by much secrecy. We know that the scheme will require large and complex IT systems.

<a name="60116-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness concede the principle that there will be a benefit to the taxpayer in increased taxation arising out of the introduction of the scheme?

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60116-05_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I am very happy to concede that it is theoretically possible for that to occur if the scheme were implemented in a way that was properly connected to the Inland Revenue, at a cost which was not disproportionate to the benefits that were obtained by the Inland Revenue. We have obtained no information whatever on any of that.
</p>

<a name="60116-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Before the noble Lord intervened, I was talking about the need for this ID card scheme to rest on large and complex IT systems. Many noble Lords referred in Committee to the Government&#039;s poor record in implementing major IT systems, but that is not part of our case on this amendment. However, freedom of information requests have produced no useful information on the gateway reviews or the risk registers that government projects are supposed to draw up. This is in marked contrast with projects in other parts of government. When we add this secrecy to the secrecy about costs, we see one of the most opaque and unsatisfactory set of proposals that Parliament has ever had to consider. For that reason, an additional process of scrutiny of costs and benefits in another place is an essential addition to this Bill. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="60116-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, my name is on this amendment with that of the noble Baroness. I shall make a few remarks on what, on any reckoning, is a highly important amendment&#151;and indeed a highly unusual one, but then these are highly unusual circumstances, as the noble Baroness made clear.
</p>

<a name="60116-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>When previously has Parliament been asked to legislate on an initiative of this scale, complexity and sensitivity without there being the fullest explanation and justification of the technicalities and cost? We are not, after all, ordering some new-generation aircraft carrier; we are bringing into being a system of surveillance of every citizen in the land over the age of 15, if the Government have their way, dealing not just with the identity of us all, but with a range of personal information, some of it highly sensitive, and that caught by the so-called audit trail.
</p>

<a name="60116-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, well put it, despite the novelty, scale and civil libertarian importance of the ID card scheme, we have received nothing more, as yet, beyond the estimate of the annual running costs of the Home Office alone, and then only in relation to the issue of passports and ID cards. That has been put&#151;I like the notion of an estimate&#151;at &#163;584 million. I would not be as adamant about this&#151;and, I am sure, many of your Lordships would not feel as keenly&#151;were it not that what information we have been given has been extracted with as much difficulty as if we were pulling out the Prime Minister&#039;s teeth. Indeed, it was he&#151;let us not forget it&#151;who told the Labour Party conference in 1995, when Michael Howard, then Home Secretary, was introducing an ID scheme that was not dissimilar to this, the following:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;Instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on compulsory ID cards as the Tory Right demands, let that money provide thousands more police officers on the beat in our local communities&quot;.</p>

<a name="60116-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Hear, hear! Mr Blair was absolutely right, except that we are talking of wasting not a few hundred million pounds, but, more likely, billions of pounds.

</p>

<a name="60116-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I must confess that, in this game of blind man&#039;s bluff, the estimate of the all-in costs seems to have been honestly, conscientiously and indeed expertly endeavoured&#151;if I can use that word&#151;by the London School of Economics Identity Project. The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, has repeated several times that the information that we need to do our job is commercially sensitive and hence closed to us, because we are in the middle of the tendering process for the ID card scheme. The LSE group, as noble Lords will know, finds that excuse wholly unconvincing. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, talked of the reality of the tendering process. She, like the LSE, does not believe that explanation. But the overarching objection to the Government&#039;s refusal to give Parliament the full figures is constitutional. It is only because the Government have jumped the gun and apparently got as far as going out to tender that the issue arises at all. Frankly, that is their lookout. Apart from the presumptuousness of assuming that they will get their will in Parliament&#151;and that says a lot&#151;it would be the death knell for the role of Parliament in holding governments to account if they could so easily evade proper financial scrutiny. I have asked &quot;greybeards&quot; from around this place and outside for other instances of such bare-faced presumption. No one has been able to tell me anything comparable.

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>As noble Lords will know, over the weekend the LSE group published a second report which reviews the conclusions of the first in the light of subsequent developments. The first report was issued last June. Sir Howard Davies, director of the LSE&#151;and it should not be forgotten that until recently he was head of the Financial Services Authority, which knows a thing or two about financing&#151;states in the introduction:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;As this second report shows, the Government have not been very forthcoming in providing details of their proposals. The LSE team stands by the cost estimates outlined in its first report, but changes to the policy made by the Home Office make it difficult now to produce a definitive assessment of the total cost&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>That was the team&#039;s hope in producing a second report. Although the LSE project originally supported an ID scheme in principle, it expressed itself thus in the second report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;In the light of the numerous inconsistencies and conflicts that have emerged, serious unanswered concerns that remain, project dynamics that are dysfunctional and potential outcomes that may be harmful to the public interest we can now no longer support even the principle of an identity scheme owned and operated by the Home Office. Its primary purposes remain unsubstantiated, its benefits remain unclear and its costs opaque&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Again, in case some noble Lords are unaware of the people who form that project, it includes over 12 professors from the London school, I believe.

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Part of their mounting unease arises from the      Cabinet Office publication last November, <i>Transformational Government Enabled by Technology.</i> I cannot resist giving those noble Lords who have not seen it a flavour of its approach. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;Government will create an holistic approach to identity management, based on a suite of identity management solutions that enable the public and private sectors to manage risk and provide cost-effective services trusted by customers and stakeholders&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>I cannot also resist noting the bland managementspeak and the reduction of citizens to &quot;customers&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60116-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>A report by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers this month, <i>Loser&#151;Britain&#039;s identity crisis</i>, states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;The design of the system is based on unreliable and inadequate technologies that could result in privacy and security problems&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>As has been made clear, the fact is that most government departments have not yet bought into the scheme, which means that they have not yet conducted publishable research into costs and benefits. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated last month that it could do none of those things until,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;policy issues relating to the use of or access to ID cards overseas have been clarified&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 19/12/05; col. 2483W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>That general riposte is, in effect, repeated by many other departments. Given that last October the Home Office stated that it foresaw 44,000 private sector users and 265 government departmental and agency users, the need for the amendment and the homework that it will produce could not be clearer.
</p>

<a name="60116-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The LSE and the Home Office, in so far as the Home Office has come out of its bunker, disagree about more than they agree. They disagree about the number of changes likely to be notified to the registrar over a 10-year period. Will the contingency costs be &#163;250 million or &#163;1.2 billion? They disagree about the life expectancy of an ID card. Will it be three years, five years or 10 years? They disagree about likely card replacement levels through damage or theft. They disagree about the cost of biometric readers. Will it be &#163;250 or &#163;3,500? They disagree about the cost and likely usable life of mobile registration centres and biometric registration devices. I could go on, but I shall not.
</p>

<a name="60116-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>When the LSE tried to enter into discussions with PA Consulting, which had been engaged by the Home Office for this scheme, the LSE was rebuffed. When it set up a meeting with the Treasury, it was cancelled by the Home Office at the last minute. As the LSE report puts it, it has perceived,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;an emerging siege mentality inimical to the project&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Therefore, the LSE&#039;s second report declined to revise figures in the first report and concluded that it no longer felt that the Home Office was the right or fit department to oversee the ID cards scheme, which it considers should be transferred to the Treasury.

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 434</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

June, which, including the integration costs across government, come out at between &#163;19 billion and &#163;24 billion over 10 years, in comparison with the Home Office figure of &#163;584 million a year. The order of difference is enormous. As my earlier quote from Mr Blair rightly implied, politics is about choices; and choices on how best to deal with security, crime, immigration, welfare fraud and so on can be made sensibly only if one knows roughly how much money one has to spend and what the alternatives are. Mr Blair mentioned having more community police, and many of us would say, &quot;Hear, hear&quot; to that; but all the other heads of supposed benefit are open to alternative ways of going about it.

<a name="60116-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Without this amendment, the citizen in public bars up and down this land of ours will tell us that we are buying a pig in a poke and putting the cart before the horse. This House should allow Parliament to do neither.

<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60116-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, I have generally indicated my great concern about the costs of this project, and those concerns remain. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Rees-Mogg, as I would have preferred to speak about what he wrote about today in the <i>Times</i>, but we are obliged under our rules to talk about costs today. So I cannot refer to the great quote of Rousseau&#039;s to which he referred:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>That is a slight exaggeration in relation to this Bill, as even the noble Lord might agree; but we are concerned with costs. I am very much concerned although, as I have said, in principle I do not oppose the idea of an identity card.
</p>

<a name="60116-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I regret one or two remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and the noble Baroness, who seemed to be more concerned with party politics than they were about the detail of the cost problem, although the noble Lord certainly went into that problem. But to hear the noble Baroness refer to my noble friend the Minister, as I believe she did, as a control freak, or anyway to refer to somebody as a control freak&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60116-06_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I do not think that anything that I said could possibly have led anyone to believe that I described the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, as a control freak. What I did say was that I thought she was working to a very restrictive brief. That is all that I said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60116-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, of course&#151;but the whole impression that I got from the noble Baroness&#039;s speech was that she was not listening to her new leader, who was concerned not to be as provocative as she was, and concentrate on costs. But I may be mistaken on that, too, and I apologise to the noble Baroness in advance if I am.
</p>

<a name="60116-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Let me return to the whole question of costs. The fact is that the amendment, which I do not particularly like, although I shall support it, has a lot of faults, because it talks not about facts but about estimates. We can dispute whether the LSE&#039;s assumptions and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_435"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 435</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

estimates are right or whether the Government&#039;s are right. I am bound to say that looking at estimates is generally not done well by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I speak from a modest four years as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. My noble friend Lord Sheldon could do better&#151;he served as chairman for three parliamentary terms. The plain fact is that the Comptroller and Auditor General prefers to look at facts and then compare them with estimates previously made by any government. As the House will know, the Public Accounts Committee and the C&AG do not generally concern themselves with party politics, only with facts. The amendment asks the Comptroller and Auditor General to give a report on estimates, but I think he would find that rather difficult.

</p>

<a name="60116-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>We have now had a reply, in a letter from my noble friend Lady Scotland to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, dated 11 January, which was somehow copied to me, and I am grateful to her. Her answers on costs did not convince me. If she were really to tell us the truth of this, she would tell us that the Government do not know what the costs will be. That must be the case, and it would have been better if she had said so. They cannot know. I do not know if the LSE is right, or whether the Government are. Assumptions are bound to have been made, and we will only know later if they were right. That is one reason why I am not happy with the amendment, but I will come back to that.
</p>

<a name="60116-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The Government seem to accept that there are problems with the estimates. The Minister&#039;s replies in the debates we have had here and in the letter I have quoted emphasise the fact that they are concerned about costs. If so, I would have thought they would have no serious problem in accepting this amendment, because it only asks for a government report on estimates. The amendment rightly does not seek to define &quot;estimates&quot; in too much detail. It would be extremely difficult to provide any definition. Any government report of the kind addressed by this amendment would be easy for the Government to accept. They would get this report about estimates, which would be no better than all the information we have had already, and which would then go back to the House of Commons for consideration. One of the reasons I support this amendment, as, I think, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said, is that it would give the other place a chance to rethink, which is what this House is all about. I believe that this House holds the Government more to account than the other place, but that is another matter. I am no longer in the other place. It might have been better then, but I am too modest to say so.
</p>

<a name="60116-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>I do not intend to say too much about the detail of the amendment, because it would be wrong to do so in this debate. The letter my noble friend sent to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and copied to a number of us&#151;perhaps it is in the Library; I do not know&#151;refers to KPMG, which the noble Baroness, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_436"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 436</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lady Noakes, will know very well. I gather she was a major, serious and senior part of that organisation. The letter says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;KPMG&#039;s conclusion was that the vast majority of ICC cost assumptions were reasonable&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>but it does not stop there; it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;reasonable for this stage&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Of course, at this stage it is impossible to do better than that. That is why it is important for the Government to have an opportunity to rethink, although, as I say, I am not happy with the idea of relying on the Comptroller and Auditor General. Not that I do not have the highest possible regard for the C&AG; I do. My experience of the Comptroller and Auditor General has always been that we have been very fortunate, as has the other place, to have such high quality people in charge. They have presented excellent reports to the Public Accounts Committee, which have usually been dealt with very well by that all-party committee. However, this is not the occasion for the C&AG; it is more an occasion for the other place to have an opportunity to rethink. That is why, given my concern about costs, I very strongly support the amendment.

<a name="60116-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Wright of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, I note that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said that past IT failures were no part of her case. However, perhaps I may briefly tell the House that I still bear the scars of a failing Foreign Office IT communications project at the end of the 1980s when the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, quite justifiably gave me an extremely uncomfortable time in trying to defend a project which turned out to be about twice as expensive as we had estimated and it did not work. So I shall vote for the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="60116-06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, in a moment I shall take up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, about the costs not being known. He clearly did not listen over the weekend to the leader of my party on the subject of identity cards. It was perfectly clear that he entirely agrees with the views of my noble friend who moved the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60116-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I take up the arguments advanced by the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, on the sixth day in Committee when we last debated the issue. First, I pointed out to her that it was not a universal practice of government departments to withhold estimates and that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor had given us an estimate of the cost of the Supreme Court, to which she said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;The issues that arise from which building to buy for the Supreme Court are different from the issues we now have to deal with, for this reason: the provision of secure facilities and managed IT data centres is a highly competitive market&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Presumably the noble Baroness was arguing at that point that the construction industry was not a highly competitive market. If that is so, it really is the reverse of truth to say that there is no case for not giving the estimate. Clearly, if there is not a competitive market, it may be true that the market will bid something like the estimate given by the Government. However, she <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_437"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 437</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

went on to say that it would be quite wrong to publish detailed costings now of the IT arrangements. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;If, for example, I were to say how much of the &#163;584 million annual running costs is expected to be spent on running the national identity register, or the estimated cost of printing plastic ID cards, companies specialising in this sort of work would tailor their bids, to the estimates we suggest, as I have just indicated. In plain terms, there would be no chance of finding a cheaper option as no one would dream of bidding lower than our forecast costs, even if that could be done&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 19/12/05; col. 1563.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>She was saying that this was a highly competitive market. I can understand that there may be officials in the Home Office with no commercial experience who would write that kind of argument. What I find surprising is that the noble Baroness, who is normally so very sharp and acute, could have brought herself to read it out. If she had been in court and it had been an argument advanced on the other side, I can imagine how she would have demolished it. The noble Baroness had been handling three major Bills over previous weeks. This was the sixth day. I suspect that she was tired and bored with the subject and it was easier to read out the answer.
</p>

<a name="60116-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>But this is a highly competitive market. It is a highly important contract. It is the kind of contract that companies in the field will want to win. They are major companies. Many are international companies. They will work out as best they can the costs of the project&#151;what they think they can do the project at&#151;and add a suitable margin to cover risks and profit margins.
</p>

<a name="60116-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>They will do something else as well&#151;they will work on the assumption that the costs will escalate, because they know that the Government will change their requirements frequently, and that there will be changing security requirements over the years. In their contracts, they will have careful clauses to ensure that, if those things happen, they can produce additional charges. But their object will be to win the contract. They know that the Government will select the most competitive bid placed, assuming that the company has been accepted as a reputable company that can do the work. The idea that the companies will all bid the same&#151;what the Government say is the estimate&#151;is so fantastic that I simply find it incomprehensible that it could have been seriously advanced from the Benches opposite.
<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="60116-06_time0"></a><h5>3.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60116-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I turn to the second argument that has been repeatedly put, which is that the Government cannot give us the costs of the non-Home Office expenses, because the other departments have not really got round to working out whether they will need or use the thing yet. That is self-evidently nonsense as well. For example, we know that the Foreign Office, about which we have heard already, issues passports at its embassies and consular posts abroad. I have a passport issued by the Foreign Office at its embassy in Caracas, after an unfortunate loss on a beach somewhere in Venezuela. To issue a passport in those circumstances, the Foreign Office will need the apparatus that makes it possible for it to give the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_438"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 438</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

biometric information. I pointed that out repeatedly in Committee, and entirely failed to get an answer out of the Government.
</p>

<a name="60116-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Let us take a look at the noble Baroness&#039;s arguments about Home Office benefits. We had an intervention earlier from the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, asking about the benefits, and we had some benefits spelt out in detail by the noble Baroness on the first day in Committee. She said that the benefits accruing to what she called the Home Office area of responsibilities amounted to between, depending on whether you took the lower or the higher figure, &#163;600 million or just over &#163;1 billion. But, to get those benefits, the police would have to have the equipment, as would Her Majesty&#039;s Customs and Excise and the Department for Work and Pensions. You do not get the benefits unless they come into the scheme. If the Home Office claims that it will benefit in that way, it cannot say that the costs are only those that relate to passports and an identity card directly related to passports. I am perfectly prepared, in broad terms, to accept that the Government may not be wildly out over the costs of issuing passports and identity cards relating to passports, because they are already planning for it. No doubt they have some detailed information that is more reliable than in other cases. However, they cannot claim all the other benefits without knowing what the other departments are doing.
</p>

<a name="60116-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Incidentally, one other area has suddenly come into the equation. According to at least the press on the weekend before last, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, in his ministerial role, issued a consultation document that said that local government would be involved and would have to compare the entries on this register with those on the electoral register. Apparently&#151;it is a horrifying thought&#151;they will then act as a sort of policing body to ensure that the information is accurate. If it is not, substantial penalties can of course be imposed. I do not like the idea of the local authorities acting in that role at all, but that is a separate subject that we need to return to.
</p>

<a name="60116-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I finish with a slightly different point. A few days ago, the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, and I attended a meeting where we were briefed by many of the potential providers of the technology. Basically, they were there to answer questions on whether the technical problems could be overcome. I was struck by one overwhelming fact: they kept saying that, at present, they did not exactly know the Government&#039;s requirements; they did not know what the tender requirements would be. Indeed, in some cases they will not know until we have the orders and the detail later. I wrote down one comment: &quot;We would welcome a much more in-depth engagement with industry&quot;. One thing that is quite certain is that if the industry does not yet know what the technical solutions are because they have not yet had the brief that enables them to give the technical answers, they certainly do not know what the costs are.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_439"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 439</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>That is why I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. If the Government were being honest about this, they would say, &quot;The real reason why we are not giving you any of that information is that we haven&#039;t the faintest idea what the costs of this great project will be&quot;. They may be enormous. My conclusion is that there are two certainties: whatever estimates are now made, they will grow and grow and will be exceeded; and the final total cost will be far in excess of anything that is presented to us by anyone at present. It seems absolutely extraordinary that the Government should ask Parliament to proceed with this vast scheme on that foundation. Therefore, I strongly support the amendment tabled by my noble friend and I hope that the House will vote for it tonight.

<a name="60116-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Soley: </b>   My Lords, I am slightly puzzled by this debate. When I read the amendments, I assumed that the debate would essentially be about costs. When one listens to the debate or reads the article by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, in today&#039;s <i>Guardian</i>, it is pretty clear that the debate is still about the principle and this is becoming very close to a Second Reading debate.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I do not wish to go into it again, but if this is about the principle, bear in mind that many democracies around the world, which enjoy the rule of law, have identity cards. It is not crippling to the population; they are popular; and the idea is fairly popular here. I understand that saying the system will be costly undermines public confidence in the argument in favour of identity cards. As a party politician, it would be wrong of me to dismiss that as being without relevance. However, it seems to me that if the issue is about costs, I am not sure that the amendments address that at all. To give the noble Baroness her due, she focused on quite an important part: the tendering process.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>I have a great deal of respect for my noble friend Lord Barnett who has a very impressive record on this. He has said that this House is at its best when it holds the other House and the Government to account. However, I am not convinced that it does it best in this way. If the matter really is about expense, frankly I would not have heard all these arguments before, as I have. I have heard them in the House of Commons and in the wider public area. So what new things are being said here other than, as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, straightforwardly said in his <i>Guardian </i>article today, &quot;I am against it in principle&quot;? That is what it is really about.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>There is a case for looking in detail at the expense, not because other countries have done it at a perfectly reasonable price and not because this country did not have an ID card before&#151;which of course it did have in the rather special circumstances of the Second World War&#151;but because we are employing so much new technology. The key question is how well the technology will work. Expense alone does not tell one that, which is why such matters are often better dealt with in the more detailed analysis of a Select Committee or a special committee of that type. I often <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_440"></a>

wonder whether we would not be better placed to advance our arguments on the issue of costs if we did it that way.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>It is true to say that if the expense of an ID card comes in very high and if it stays high, a great deal of political damage will be done to the government who introduce it. You only need think of the analogy of putting up the cost of the television licence. Think of putting up the cost of an ID card. Think of the initial cost of the ID card or, as my honourable friend the Minister indicates with the movement of his hands, a driving licence. There is a range of issues and arguments around this, but they are not being addressed today.

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I say this cautiously, because I am a new Member of this House and do not like to jump to the conclusion that I have understood all the subtleties of this place when I obviously have not. I worry, however, that if we, as political parties&#151;whether Labour, Tory or Liberal Democrat&#151;simply recycle the arguments that the parties had in another place, we do not enhance our status. We ought to be about enhancing our status as well as examining the evidence.

<a name="60116-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, before the noble Lord, Lord Soley, sits down, he said that he did not think that this was the way to hold the other place to account on this project. What would be the way to do that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="60116-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Soley: </b>   My Lords, I indicated that if noble Lords are going to look at the technology and costs, they might want to do that in a much more detailed way in Committee, as well as questioning Ministers. The broad thrust of my remarks, however, was that most of the arguments put today, including by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, have been heard before. That is not a reason for not doing it again. I am not saying that it should never be done again. I am simply saying that it is probably not the most effective way of holding the other place to account.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>We need to be much clearer. I think the noble Lord ought to come out and say &quot;I am going to use every trick in the book to undermine the political credibility of this enterprise because I am against it in principle&quot;. I could understand that, and would have no problem with it. However, the noble Lord has put forward an amendment which&#151;as my noble friend Lord Barnett said&#151;is not very effective in doing what he, and certainly the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said they wanted it to do.

The Government have not listened to the arguments about costs. Whatever the noble Lord thinks about it, it is House of Lords procedure that, at this point, you would push an amendment to its limit to find out what the opinion of the House is. The fact that is has been debated before does not mean that it is not right now to test the opinion of the House, which I am sure is going to happen.

</p>

<a name="60116-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>It is not just political point-scoring. In fact, that is why, at this stage, speeches should stick to the amendment and not wander off into other areas. By and large, most people have stuck to that. I am quickly going to do exactly that. There is nothing new in the arguments being put right now, but the problem is that the Government have not listened and come back with anything.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Every benefit has a cost. I think everyone knows that. In normal business and in running the country, one needs to do a cost-benefit analysis. It is a complete waste of taxpayers&#039; money if it costs you much more to do something than the benefit you get from it, if there are other, better, ways of doing it. For instance, I fully support a biometric passport which is about to be issued under the e-borders scheme. It will have international standard biometrics buried in it, will let you cross borders more easily and will get you through airports and other places more quickly. That is a good idea.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Something we should be worried about, however&#151;everything everyone has said on this has been quite right&#151;in addition to the things that the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, has said about his passport and other things, is that in order to deliver the benefits listed in Clause 1&#151;for instance,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;for the purposes of the protection or detection of crime&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>

<a name="60116-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>this system will have to interface with the police national computer. Alternatively, an index to the police national computer is needed; the national identity register is not. The costs and benefits for that need to be worked out. It may be cheaper to store everyone&#039;s fingerprints on the police national computer, with an index into it, because no criminal information is allowed to be stored on the national identity register. Again, that cost-benefit analysis should be done.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Immigration controls are enforced with the IND computer. Biometric stuff is issued to new arrivals, and they are biometrically checked if they reapply when they come in. If the IND computer is to interface, for the purposes of the Bill, with the national identity register, then those costs and benefits should be weighed up and put before Parliament before we go into this expensive exercise.

That is the work permits UK computer system. It may be cheaper to have an index straight into that. You need to do the cost benefit analysis.

<a name="60116-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I shall not bore the House with the address issue now because I shall bring it up when we get to it, but the system must interface to verify addresses with what would have been&#151;had it not fallen by the wayside about two or three months ago&#151;the national spatial and address infrastructure effort, to bring together the postal address database. Not everyone lives at postal addresses. Many things are used to identify OWPAs&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>

objects without postal address. You get them off the Ordnance Survey or various other things, which I shall talk about later. That will have to be sorted out first, and there will be copyright problems.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>It is technically possible. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, when he says that, and the people who have put it forward. But the amount of change management and the operation involved for the individual departments that are not Home Office-controlled to get the true benefits is enormous. Until that is sorted out we should not be going forward, blowing an awful lot of taxpayers&#039; money on something that could be pie in the sky. Blue-skies thinking is fine for universities, but it is not the right thing to do with central government money.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>I do not want to bore the House, but before sitting down I shall refer to schemes such as federated identity&#151;it is becoming much more popular and is much more an establishment thought&#151;which allows the citizen control of his identity, and still enables delivery of central government services for the purpose of securing efficient and effective provision of public services. That can be done with a federated ID scheme quite happily. But I am not sure that the Bill would enable that to be implemented should a cost benefit analysis show it as the best way forward. I am trying to work on later amendments in case, three years down the road, we decide to go that way instead of using the national identity register.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The cheapest is not always the best, as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, said. We have to consider the whole life costs and the costs of support later on. We must be very careful about the temporary process.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>There are little things to consider. I worked with smart cards 10 or 12 years ago. A letter from the Home Office states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;a ten year card life is possible&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>It may be with new cards; I do not know.
</p>

<a name="60116-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>When that letter compares Hong Kong and Spain, I realise that the Home Office has missed the point. The problem with cards in general is that in this country we get icy windscreens in winter. The thing nearest to hand for many is a plastic card. A credit card is useful because people can get goods and services with it. An ID card will not be very useful so, in preference in future, people will use their ID card to wipe their windscreens. Unfortunately chips pop out and delaminate.

He brought out his referee&#039;s whistle to blow it at other people. I hope that he will accept that there is widespread anxiety in the House about the lack of information. If the Government had given some accurate information about the likely costs, the debate might have ranged more narrowly. I thought that every word spoken by my noble friend, whom I congratulate, was perfectly justified, as was all that was said by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips.

</p>

<a name="60116-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I have a limited number of points. First, I was moved by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Wright, and his obviously painful memory of having been chastised by the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, in the past. I shall add nothing to that, save the rather vain hope&#151;most hopes at my age are rather vain&#151;of longing for the day when his opposite number at present in the Home Office will suffer an equally severe and painful flagellation, which will be attended by the same awful memories that he shared with us today.
</p>

<a name="60116-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>There are widely different estimates. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, is quite right to say that it is no good talking about estimates and throwing them at the Comptroller and Auditor General. We need costs. If we have no reliable figures we must make do with the bone we have.
</p>

<a name="60116-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The noble Baroness performs with skill, calm and grace. What a pity that her colleagues, who framed these policies, do nothing to deserve the performance that she puts up on the Front Bench. I do not wish to embarrass her with too many congratulations, but she is an example to her colleagues and I wish only that she had more success in persuading them to see sense. Alas, she does not.
</p>

<a name="60116-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Soley, will not be too vexed if I repeat this, but we are dealing with a very comprehensive system of surveillance. Many of us do not like it, and the idea that the Government should get a blank cheque from us to pay for it is odious. In passing, I also echo a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, about freedom of information. I hardly know what to say about it. So far as I understand it, in modern parlance freedom of information means that the Government shall have access to all the information that they require, but on the other hand, when it does not suit them and when it is administratively inconvenient or impossible to give the information, it is not a matter that is going to bother the present Administration at all.

</p>

<a name="60116-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>I worry about the Bill. It is a thoroughly bad measure. The Government should have shown the necessary respect for the parliamentary institution, been aware that this information would be most earnestly required and that their &quot;we can&#039;t do better than we have&quot; attitude was not good enough. I shall have no qualms about supporting this amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Soley, refers to playing party politics, but it is part of the government party against the rest.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;the costs that are estimated to be incurred during a period of 10 years after the date to which the estimate is prepared or such longer future period as shall be determined by the Secretary of State&quot;.</p>

However, like my noble friend, I regret that I have a number of questions which, so far, are unanswered.
</p>

<a name="60116-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>I am opposed to the whole concept of ID cards, since it is rather like Big Brother watching you. It is always good that a government keep track of their citizens, and every law-abiding person is happy to sign. I am worried about the crooks, the underground thieves and those people who do not pay tax, for how will identity cards help to bring them into the net? I am sure that every Member of this House will sign up to an identity card process, if the time comes. However, we on these Benches&#151;and, it appears, other sections of the House&#151;are extremely worried about what the costs might be.

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>We all know that the Government seem to favour a firm of accountants to the London School of Economics. I hold no brief for either, except to say that the London School of Economics has a somewhat similar nature to the top end of chartered accountants, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers or Peat Marwick, now KPMG, and so on. I heard only today that 12 professors were involved in putting these estimates <br>&nbsp;<br>

together. I would not necessarily hold out that the estimates&#151;and they are only estimates&#151;will be any different coming from one organisation or another.
</p>

<a name="60116-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Can it possibly be fair, therefore, to be buying a product for a figure&#151;in this case, for what we must call the nebulous figure of &#163;584 million&#151;if you are not going to be told what you will get from it, or how much it will really cost? Is it really morally correct that someone can sell you something for that amount of money if you are not entitled to the details? For example, if I were buying a business and were told that the cost was &#163;584 million, I would say, &quot;Fine&#151;can I have details? Can I look at the balance sheet and the profit and loss account?&quot;. In this case, we are getting no such details.
</p>

<a name="60116-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>My noble friend Lady Noakes referred to competitive issues, as indeed did others including the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. The more competition that there is, the better to get a cheaper price rather than a secretive, organised one arranged separately by government. I do not know how many companies the Government are in touch with about this&#151;although the Minister would&#151;but I am very much of the opinion that the more are involved in competing for what would be an extremely large contract, the better. That would mean we will get it for a cheaper price. I am no great mathematician but I have worked out that, by taking &#163;584 million forward for the 10-year period that we are talking about and allowing for 2 per cent inflation per annum, after five years it would become &#163;644 million and after 10 years &#163;711 million. We all agree that these figures are nebulous and uncertain, but they show that building-in even only a 2 per cent inflation figure escalates the cost dramatically.
</p>

<a name="60116-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>What will be the capital cost? We really do not know. We have heard mention of from &#163;10 billion to &#163;19 billion, and I believe the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, mentioned a figure today of possibly &#163;24 billion. These are colossal figures. They would contribute towards the budgets for education and the health service to a remarkable degree.
</p>

<a name="60116-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Let me go a little further and talk about what the identity card will cost if it is to be foisted on the public. Will it cost &#163;30, &#163;60, &#163;90, &#163;100, &#163;200 or &#163;300? Even a sum of &#163;500 was mentioned in the press at the weekend. I do not think the public would go for that and the whole thing would be a disaster. The noble Lord, Lord Wright, mentioned that when you are introducing new technology, new equipment and so on, it always has tweaks and can fall down. I always believe that whatever costs are built-in, they will end up higher. We are all entitled to know the answers to these questions. I emphasise what my noble friend Lady Noakes said in her opening remarks: we need more information.
</p>

<a name="60116-08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>What about the link between passports and ID cards? If the Government are going to lump the two together, will this result in a different figure and be quantified in a different way? The Government have said that ID cards are to help with security, but will they help to deal with people who are involved in shadow areas&#151;for instance, those who do not pay <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60116-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, I regard this legislation as the most important I have had to vote on in all my 25 years in the Palace of Westminster because, while I support the Bill, I recognise that it changes the relationship between the state and the individual&#151;in my view, in a very positive way. That is why&#151;this brings me to a criticism of what has happened&#151;I lobbied very aggressively inside the Government prior to the Bill being announced, when David Blunkett was Home Secretary, to make sure that it was not dealt with by a Select Committee in the House of Commons but by a Joint Committee of both Houses.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>I believe that the arguments put forward by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll&#151;who clearly has a very wide knowledge of these subjects&#151;should have taken place inside that Joint Committee, drawing on the expertise of many other Members of this House who, within their particular areas on this Bill, have argued in detail. We should have had the opportunity in Joint Committee of pressing those details to conclusion. I believe that that would have avoided much of the debate which is now taking place in the House.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>Secondly, the whole debate has gone topsy-turvy. The reality is that, in the event that the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher&#151;who is in her place today&#151;was still Prime Minister, a Conservative government would be introducing this Bill. Many of us treat this legislation as utterly inevitable. Therefore, behind the scenes there always was a consensus that we would move down this route. That brings me back once again to my view that we should have had in place a Joint Committee arrangement to allow the best minds in the land in this institution of Parliament to consider these matters.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>In my view, it is still not too late, despite the amendments that are being moved this evening. There is still room for an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement to be established as the legislation slowly makes its way through departments in the period of implementation. I appeal to my noble friend please not to rely uniquely on the skills of civil servants to deal with these matters. We are simply discarding the huge expertise that is available and the ability of Parliament to ask questions on the minutiae, which might well, during the period of implementation, affect what final decisions are taken.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Finally, I return to an issue that I raised on a previous occasion when we debated similar amendments to the Bill&#151;the tax take. I believe that, as my noble friend would probably accept, a lot more work could have been done on the whole area of estimates. Clearly a lot more work could have been done on the area of benefits. There will be a vast increase in the tax take, as I keep saying. I just wish that those who pontificate on these matters on <br>&nbsp;<br>

television and go on about costs would start referring to the increased benefit to the taxpayer arising from the Bill. We should not be fearful of the electorate in addressing the matter in what might appear to be a fairly aggressive way in relation to the tax debate. There is a gain to be made. I think that, in the event that we have a further opportunity to scrutinise these matters, that benefit should be clearly assessed&#151;yes, with great difficulty, as we are measuring the black economy&#151;and become part of the very important debate that will take place.

</p>

<a name="60116-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Soley, that I have for some time been in favour of the principle of identity cards. However, that support has been dependent on two things. The first is the exact shape of the project and, in this case, its scale and complexity, which are unrivalled&#151;he mentioned identity cards in other countries, but I say to him that this project has never been duplicated elsewhere. The other concern is costs. I speak not just as a former Chief Secretary in saying that I think it very important that we should understand the costs. If the costs strongly outweigh the benefits, a big question mark is raised in my mind over whether we should proceed.

If that is a way in which the noble Lord is happy to approach the matter, he should support the amendment, which says that, at a later stage&#151;when the Bill has passed through the House and a lot of the details of the identity card are known&#151;the measures will not be implemented until a proper analysis has been done by the House of Commons and possibly by the Select Committee on Procedure, to which he referred. I will also say something about what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said about that, which seems to fit in with this amendment. What the noble Lord, Lord Soley, just said should cause him to think again and perhaps to support the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, that as another former Chief Secretary I understand very well his point about estimates. However, the point is that the Government have given an estimate that is so widely different from the other estimates in public that it is absolutely right for us to probe and test it. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_448"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 448</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

problem is that we do not have any of the details; we just have a global figure from the Government, so we cannot test it properly unless we go through the process that Amendment No. 123 recommends.


</p>

<a name="60116-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Let me touch on one or two points that concern me about the Government&#039;s figure. I shall take the figure not of &#163;584 million but of &#163;187 million, because the Minister said in previous debates that a lot of the cost would be incurred anyway to introduce the new passports. We are talking about an estimate of &#163;187 million to introduce a new project way beyond passports, and I frankly do not believe it. Perhaps the LSE estimate is too high, but the figure must be somewhere in-between.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Let me give some reasons why I need further details. The first concerns cost overruns. The noble Lord, Lord Wright, referred to an IT project in the Foreign Office. We all know the number of cost overruns that have been undertaken on major projects by governments of both political persuasions. The Scottish Parliament is an obvious example, but there are so many examples in IT and many other areas that there will undoubtedly be a cost overrun. What is the Government&#039;s estimate of what the cost overrun should be? I believe that there is a contingency fund of 20 per cent, although I had to dig that information out. Is that right? If it is only 20 per cent, I do not believe that that is an accurate figure for the cost overrun. We need a lot more detail on that score.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>On the capital costs, we are told that included within the figure of &#163;187 million there is depreciation and interest on capital. How can that be incorporated within &#163;187 million? Perhaps it can be, but we want to see the details. How much of the capital cost will be undertaken under PFI? I have been a strong supporter of PFI in principle and in practice, but there comes a point, just as with a company&#151;because this is effectively off-balance-sheet financing&#151;that if there is too much off-balance-sheet financing, the whole project is threatened because there is not the cash flow to pay for it. I believe that that is beginning to happen with PFI too. I was interested to see today&#039;s report in the <i>Times</i> that the Government are getting very concerned about the number of PFI projects with hospitals because there will be a substantial overrun. I think that the Treasury has woken up to the risk of undertaking too many hospital projects under PFI too soon. Will we find that there is some PFI element in these estimates? Are they realistic, and is it not likely that that will be challenged?
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, mentioned benefits, and I very much agreed with him. In my analysis, it is important that at least the costs do not substantially outstrip the benefits. The problem is that we do not have any real information from the Government on what they think, quantified, the benefits will be. In response to the KPMG review, which recommended more work on benefits, the Home Office summary of work in progress said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;A great deal of work has been undertaken with other departments to ensure the benefits for the scheme are quantified&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="60116-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I do not know whether that includes the Inland Revenue, as it used to be called, but certainly I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. If a great deal of work is going on, why is Parliament not being told? Why is Parliament not being given these figures? If they cannot be completed yet, it makes sense to have them looked at in the terms of the amendment when we come to the stage when it would be operational.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, spoke of the costs across government and not just in the Home Office. That must be right as well. I find it difficult to believe that the Treasury is not concerned about the implications of an identity card for all sorts of departments and is not already asking the departments what the likely cost will be. Substantial costs will be at the expense of other projects that the department might otherwise have undertaken in social security, education, and so on. I see the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, nodding. The Treasury has been very remiss if it has not been doing that kind of work.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>I find it alarming that all we are being given are the Home Office figures, without any indication of the others. I therefore very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, in that respect. If the Treasury has been doing the work, why can&#039;t Parliament be told as well?
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The Government have relied quite heavily on the fact that the KPMG review has given a fairly good response to what the Home Office has so far undertaken. In fact, they have rather relied on the KPMG report; instead of us being able to examine the estimates, we have to take it on trust that KPMG has done the work. Many of us have been at the receiving end of accountancy reports on a number of projects. I commend the Home Office for embarking on the KPMG report; it was obviously important and necessary to do so, but it is limited.

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>We are all used to these reports. This one was completed in a month. Most of them are completed very quickly by accountants. They are reliant on the information given by the department that sponsored it, and as much they are a test of process.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The KPMG report makes clear that it was very limited in scope. It did not cover by any means all the cost estimates being considered. It certainly is not a ringing endorsement of the cost figures. We should be quite clear about that.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>I have not yet been able to read the new LSE report, although I have seen the foreword by Sir Howard Davies, which makes it very clear where it still stands. In spite of all the criticisms, it holds its ground. The LSE report gives details, which has enabled the Government to question some of its assumptions. A number of us have seen the detailed government questioning of some of the assumptions of the LSE report.
</p>

<a name="60116-09_para17"></a>

detailed LSE review. All we are asking is that, on the basis of the LSE review, which all of us have seen, we should be able to test the Government&#039;s much more limited estimate in the same way. That is what Amendment No. 123 does, and it is why I support it.

<a name="60116-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, it is absolutely right that we should be having this discussion this afternoon on the estimated costs of the scheme. I am sorry that the Bill has come to us without having been through the Commons and examined by them. After all, the House of Commons are the guardian of the taxpayers&#039; pockets. I would have thought that they would send to us a Bill that had been properly costed, especially bearing in mind the various estimates made, ranging from about &#163;3.1 billion to &#163;27 billion. I would have thought that the House of Commons would want to know all about that before they submitted the Bill to this House for consideration.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>I have expressed myself as opposed to the Bill in principle and on cost. I opposed it on principle, as did many or probably all of the present Government when they were in opposition. I just happen to believe as I did when I supported the Opposition in this House and for a time in another place.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>It is essential that when we are dealing with taxpayers&#039; money&#151;because it is taxpayers&#039; money, not government money&#151;we should make sure that we use it properly and that we will achieve the objectives proposed. But in a Bill of this sort, which alters the arrangements and relationships between government and governed, it is important that we ensure that there is wide agreement between the political parties. It is quite clear that there is no such agreement.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>If we are not careful, we may be throwing money away. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition, who might one day be in government, said that he would scrap the ID scheme. The Liberal Democrats are against the scheme and would co-operate in scrapping it. We may spend billions of pounds in starting a scheme that has been agreed to by only one political party, which may not be in government for much longer than a few years. I object to the Government spending money, on the basis that that money is not being well spent for a long-term project.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>I support this amendment because it at least has the merit of ensuring that the House of Commons, if they agree to it, require the Government to produce realistic estimates which can be supported. We know all about cost overruns, which have been referred to several times during this debate. The NHS computer programme has been mentioned in previous debates. It was estimated to cost &#163;1 billion and it is now estimated to cost &#163;30 billion. We are also made aware virtually every day of the costs of the Child Support Agency, which was supposed to garner &#163;400 million per annum in benefit to the Treasury. It now costs the Treasury hundreds of millions of pounds every year to run. So we really must be careful. I hope that this amendment <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_451"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 451</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will be passed so that the House of Commons can properly do their duty and ensure that taxpayers&#039; money is spent not wastefully, but productively.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="60116-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Marlesford: </b>   My Lords, I support my noble friend&#039;s amendment. As the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, well knows, I have always been in favour of the concept of a national identity register, for the reasons that I set out at Second Reading. I am not in favour of cards. I regard them as a provocative, expensive complication, but I shall not go into that now.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The reason that I support the amendment so strongly is that the wholly spurious, commercial arguments which the Home Office has put forward for denying Parliament the necessary information underwrite its incompetence to administer this project. As the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, will know, we shall be debating later this week another, much smaller Home Office computer project, which is the attempt to put all the police&#039;s firearms records on to a central register. That was required by an Act of Parliament in 1997. That it still has not happened is what we will be looking at on Thursday afternoon. I remind the House that the late, lamented Lord Williams of Mostyn estimated in February 1999 the cost of that important but much smaller project to be &#163;300,000 to &#163;500,000. The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, updated that estimate in November last year by saying that the Home Office has already spent &#163;5.6 million and the project has not yet been completed. We simply cannot give to the Home Office a blank cheque.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60116-10_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Northesk: </b>   My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, I have deep reservations about this Bill on grounds of principle. Nevertheless, I have some sympathy with the view of the noble Lord, Lord Soley, that costs are dependent on the technology to be used. Accordingly, I shall follow up on the opening remarks of my noble friend Lady Noakes on the gateway review process.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I note that various organisations, notably the IT magazine <i>Computer Weekly</i>, have resorted to the Freedom of Information Act to elicit information about the status of a variety of IT procurement projects across government. So far as I am aware, the identity cards project is one of the few projects, if not the only one, where the relevant information has not been forthcoming. As your Lordships will be aware, the whole point of the gateway review process is to obviate the inherent risks in IT procurement by categorising various stages of any given project via the mechanism of a traffic light system. If a green signal is given, it implies that the project is in good order. If red is given, urgent remedial action is required. Needless to say, this is relevant to the ongoing viability of the project. Yet, not only do we not know whether ID cards have been given a red, green or amber light, we do not even know to which of the process&#039;s six stages it has been taken thus far.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>It is impossible to make rational judgments on the viability, affordability and proportionality of the scheme without this information. Nevertheless, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_452"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 452</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

justification for refusing to release the information is, as far as I am aware, rooted in issues of commercial confidentiality. Perhaps I am being unnecessarily obtuse, but I simply cannot conceive of how the release of appropriate information about which stage of the gateway process the ID card scheme has reached, and the status of each stage within the traffic light system, could impinge upon commercial confidentiality.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Therefore, I invite, indeed, urge, the Minister to provide some insight about that to enable us to scrutinise the Bill properly. Without the reassurance of that sort of information, and wider information about costs, it is little wonder that the concerns and anxieties of noble Lords, not least those of the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, are provoked.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60116-10_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Henig: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may something about costs and benefits. I declare an interest as president of the Association of Police Authorities. As is the case with many on these Benches, I strongly believe that the ID cards scheme will bring a whole range of benefits across a variety of services. I am aware that many noble Lords opposite do not believe that and are making clear their concerns, but it seems an extreme step to advocate a completely new constitutional approach, as in Amendment No. 123. I echo the concerns expressed by my noble friend on that amendment, because it contains a number of elements that would be extremely difficult to carry out in practice.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>I am clear about the need for containing the costs of this scheme and preventing overruns. We are all concerned about that, but this scheme has already been scrutinised extensively&#151;at this stage, probably as extensively as any other scheme has been. We have already heard that it has been stringently reviewed in the Office of Government Commerce gateway process and that review is continuing. Thus far the scheme has been given a green light in relation to estimates of cost and benefit, which have passed their rigorous inspection. We have heard that KPMG&#039;s independent review of the cost methodology and the cost assumptions in the outline business case produced a very favourable report. It especially praised the high quality of the outline business case. It is fair to make that point.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>The Treasury is keeping tabs on the scheme and, of course, expenditure will be subject to the usual audit procedures by the National Audit Office. Risk assessments have been undertaken. I understand that an independent assurance panel has been established to offer a further layer of oversight with its private sector expertise in ensuring effective implementation. In the final analysis, estimates have to be approved by Parliament by being voted through the supply estimates process. Surely, that is a fairly comprehensive list of reviews and scrutiny to ensure that the project does not overrun significantly and continues to offer value for money. These are the stages that past schemes have gone through. I understand the concerns, but I do not believe that they should overthrow the process that we have been following for many years.

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 453</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Other departments will opt into the technology on an incremental basis, and presumably absorb a lot of the costs some way down the line as part of system or IT upgrades. But I wanted to put into the equation the considerable benefits to be realised by other departments. The Department for Work and Pensions has already come up with estimates for significant savings by being able to combat fraud and identity crime much more effectively&#151;and there are figures for that. There will be benefits for a whole range of departments and services in being able to check identities&#151;and we know that one of the main benefits that the general public most wants to see is more effective vetting to make sure people are who they say they are. That is a big benefit.
</p>

<a name="60116-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>I would also like to comment on behalf of the police service, to which this scheme will be of considerable value. Police will be able to expose false identities much more quickly and establish early identification of suspects. Road traffic policing and checking suspects will be much more secure, as drivers will be much less likely to give false names&#151;and I should tell the House that they do that at present in a surprisingly high number of cases. Simply ensuring that people are telling the truth when they give their names will save a lot of time.

<a name="60116-11_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, as it will not be compulsory to carry the card, I cannot see how it will be helpful in any of those circumstances. By the way, the DWP estimate of savings was &#163;50 million only, which, set against &#163;584 million costs, is not exactly very significant.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="60116-11_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Henig: </b>   My Lords, I am giving my view that, if there is an identity card scheme, drivers will be much more careful about giving false names when stopped by the police. That is my view; noble Lords are entitled to challenge it, but I believe that it will be one of the benefits of the scheme. Processing criminals, especially in custody suites, will be much easier. Indeed, in my view policing will be much more effective and much time will be saved on routine business. That is important because it means that more time and officers will be available to focus on more serious crime, on level 2 crime and protective services. Surely, we all want to see that as a matter of course. So if I am right and that is one of the great benefits of the scheme, it will benefit not only policing but the man in the street and his security.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>We need to look at costs and benefits in the round. If I did not believe that the benefits would outweigh the costs, I would not support this scheme&#151;and I believe that noble Lords opposite are being extremely pessimistic and very narrow in their focus. The picture is much more positive than many noble Lords would have us believe.

<p><a name="st_85"></a>

talking about whether or not the benefits outweigh the costs of the Bill. Parliament should know roughly what the cost will be before it accepts the scheme at all.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I do not know whether the noble Baroness was in local government, but when one is in local government, before one puts something out to tender, one decides whether the project is worth having. One asks for the broad costs, capital costs and revenue costs and one then decides whether it is worth doing. One certainly does not decide without knowing the total costs. In her extremely helpful letters to my noble friend about costs, the Minister answered a great many questions; but throughout she has said that because of commercial sensitivity it is not possible to tell Parliament broadly what the costs will be. She has said that to the London School of Economics and thus limited that body in what it can tell us.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>All the amendment is doing is to say that before the Bill is implemented and the scheme begins, Parliament&#151;and the Commons in particular, because it is the guardian of the budget&#151;should know broadly what the cost is. Quite honestly, even to me, who comes from local government, it is rubbish to say that you cannot put something out to tender without first knowing broadly what the cost will be; of course you know that. If Parliament finds it impossible to discuss big sums in public for those reasons, perhaps there is an argument for a secret session&#151;but I do not know about that because I do not know what the constitutional position would be.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>The matter is quite simple. The amendment, whether or not its wording is correct, says that the House of Commons should know the total cost before it decides to put the scheme forward. I cannot see that there is an argument against that, whether or not one wants identity cards. So I hope that the whole House will support the amendment.

<a name="60116-11_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, I assure noble Lords that I have listened with great care and interest to all that has been said, and I hope that I shall be able to answer in a way that will give your Lordships a little more confidence. I take this opportunity to thank the noble Lords, Lord Peyton and Lord Steinberg, for giving me such unmerited and glorious praise; but we believe that on this occasion the Government have given me meat with which to work&#151;it is not as empty as noble Lords fear. We should remind ourselves that this particular enterprise is going to be put into the hands of the Passport Office. Noble Lords should understand that it is because of the expertise and the level of acuity and care this office has demonstrated that we are minded so to do. The Passport Office has brought its enterprises in on time and on budget.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>It is also right to remind ourselves of the context in which the changes for ID cards will be made. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, with regard to the comments made by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister when he was in opposition, that he was absolutely right about the increased in numbers of police officers. We have succeeded in doing that. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_455"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 455</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We   have an all-time record of roughly 140,000 officers. Anything we do in this sphere does not in any way jeopardise our total commitment in that regard.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>Bearing in mind what we are intending to do, we need to look at what is already in place. The changes to ID cards, as I have said, are predicated on changes that are already on course. In February the first biometric passport will be introduced, which will include facial recognition. In October the first interviews&#151;the extended background checks&#151;will commence. The network, in terms of where those interviews will take place, has already been identified. The big change will be in enrolment and the process interview, but in time that too has to be introduced for our biometric data. We currently have a complex database that contains all the information on passports, and as we move to include biometrics from fingerprints and iris identification, those two will have to be incorporated into the Passport Service.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>We have called the central new database &quot;the register&quot;, but noble Lords will be familiar with the fact that the Passport Office currently has a database. When we include the biometric data that will come from facial recognition and fingerprints, that information will have to be contained on that database. As a result of the demands made on the service, we have now piloted passport validation, a commercial service that will come on stream in 2006. It is demand-led because, even under the current legislation, there has been a demand for that from the business community.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>All of those items are coming anyway, and the passport service will have to provide for them. So if we look at the differences between the service that will be provided now and that which we anticipate will be necessary to be provided in the long term, the differences are not great. I will list them. A database of basic personal information and biometrics exists, and that will continue. An identity document that stores information, including biometrics, is already provided. The ability for banks and other organisations to validate identity documents with consent exists now in pilot form. Disclosure to the police and other agencies of data held on the passport database happens already, and this would include the equivalent audit usage data.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>So what is new? The production of cards as well as passports is new. We do not currently record changes of address, but we propose to do so in the future. The IT infrastructure will be slightly bigger; and the scheme will be enforced; that is, civil penalties, mainly post-compulsion. What about the extra benefits? There will be broader coverage&#151;that will be non-passport-holders and foreign nationals all using the same type of card; a scheme commissioner to oversee the exercise of all the powers; statutory rules for how the scheme would be used by the public and private services, and for how information would be provided without consent to the police and intelligence services; financial benefits that come with universal coverage&#151;that is, the checking of unidentified fingerprints at <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_456"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 456</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

scenes of crime; and an ability to set fees for identity verification services to meet the broader scheme&#039;s costs.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>When we consider what we now have, and what we propose, we say that around 70 per cent of the costs we have quoted would be incurred anyway in the move to biometric passports. This expenditure would not be subject to the regime set out in the amendment but would be governed by the usual rules applying to government expenditure. We need to be clear about that. This is not something outwith our ken; something that we cannot estimate. That is why have put into the public domain the figures that we already spend. The United Kingdom Passport Service for 2006&#150;07 is estimated at &#163;397 million, a figure to which the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, referred. That is already in the government expenditure plans. It will be incorporated in the estimated costs of issuing passports and ID cards of &#163;584 million. That is published in a full, regulatory impact assessment. It is not a blank cheque. We know the basis upon which this has been cast.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>If we then look at the future, it would be easy to say, &quot;If we just put the Identity Cards Bill to one side these costs would not be expended&quot;. As I hope that I have just indicated, that is unlikely because if we consider the way in which biometric data are being used and will be used in the future&#151;the Passport Office is having to provide ID verification more and more now because those demands are being made upon it&#151;we can see that this development will be necessary. I must confess that I am surprised at the suggestion from Her Majesty&#039;s loyal Opposition that if they came into power they would wish to disregard the benefits which are clear and which my noble friends Lady Henig and Lord Campbell-Savours spoke about with such passion.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, may recall that when the Bill was in another place my right honourable friend the Home Secretary gave a commitment that it would be affordable under current plans. My noble friend Lord Soley is right, therefore, about having to be practical and making sure that this is affordable because the public will demand that it is affordable; and if it is not affordable it will not retain public support.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>As a number of noble Lords have mentioned, the current plans have been scrutinised and reviewed by the accountants, KPMG, to set the charge for a stand-alone identity card at &#163;30. We believe that those costs are robust costs. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, asks how much is allowed for contingency. The published estimates include both an allowance for contingencies in accordance with Treasury guidance. In addition, an allowance has been made for the optimism bias with which the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, will be only too familiar, to offset any over-optimism in the costing assumptions. All those details have been reviewed by KPMG as well as the Treasury although it would be wrong to publish precise figures in advance of procurement. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, and my noble friend Lord Barnett, know how keenly the Treasury look at <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_457"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 457</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

estimates made by departments and how jealously they guard public funds to make sure that the last possible benefit is squeezed out for the benefit of the citizens of our country. That scrutiny has continued. Perhaps I may reassure the noble Lord, Lord Wright, that we have learned a valuable lesson from his painful experience and from the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, to ensure that we shall be able to meet these future costs in a way that is proper. We anticipate that scrutiny, and know that we will have to meet it.
<a name="time_12"></a>

</p>

<a name="60116-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>The difficulties with which we are faced are not as great as has been suggested. We have been asked, &quot;Why not provide a breakdown of the costs in response to the LSE?&quot;. We have provided potential suppliers with the sorts of information that it would be possible for us to provide, but of course we come back to confidentiality. I shall come back to some of the more specific issues in a moment.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I cannot add anything to what I have said, save to remind the House that we have published the expected costs of issuing identity cards and the current best estimates, and believe that they are sound. That cost that include all the existing costs of issuing passports through the current United Kingdom passport office. I fully accept that this is the cost of issuing the passports and identity cards and running and compiling the national identity register. It does not include future costs that may be incurred by other government departments that may choose to use identity cards as a way of improving their services to the public, any more than it includes the costs to private sector companies such as banks or building societies that decide in the future to use identity cards as a way of verifying people&#039;s identity. It would be somewhat odd if it did.
</p>

<a name="60116-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The decisions on any future investment&#151;for example, in IT systems that might be required to make the best use of identity cards&#151;will be made in due course, but not now, by the organisation concerned on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis. We confidently expect that organisations, be they public or private, will decide to make such investment if it is worth their while&#151;if the saving to them in identity fraud or the reduction in administrative costs, whatever it might be, makes the decision sensible. I was pleased that there seemed to be some agreement between the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, and my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours that the benefits are likely to be much wider than those that we have explored. There will be many net benefits to a wide range of organisations and, as your Lordships will no doubt be aware, the Government have already published a high-level summary of likely future benefits in the benefits overview paper, a copy of which is available in the Library. In the regulatory impact assessment published alongside the Bill, the Government stated that, in our view, the benefits of the scheme justify the costs. That has been confirmed by the Office of Government Commerce gateway reviews.

<a name="60116-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>It would be unprecedented for a piece of legislation such as this to be incapable of being implemented until a report on cost estimates was completed, as set out in Amendment No. 123. I agree with the criticism of the drafting made by my noble friends Lord Williams of Elvel, Lord Campbell-Savours and Lord Barnett, who was right in saying that the amendment was fundamentally flawed.

<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="60116-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, I want to ask the noble Baroness for clarification of something that she said a moment ago&#151;that the &#163;584 million would include the costs of maintaining and updating the register, and presumably with dealing with inquiries. That is not what the Explanatory Notes say; they say that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;&#163;584 million will be the annual cost of issuing biometric passports and ID cards to UK nationals&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>As for overall running costs, they are to be covered by a &quot;combination of charges&quot;&#151;charges on the public&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;for applications, issue of cards, identity verification services&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>and so on. Does the &#163;584 million cover the cost of maintaining and updating the register with every change of address and so on that we have already inquired about?
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="60116-12_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that the noble Lord has had an opportunity to look at our regulatory impact assessment and the basis of what is covered by the &#163;584 million. I have made it absolutely clear that what is incorporated in that money. Part of it is in relation to the register and putting that on board.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>We have said that the current running costs are &#163;397   million. The estimated change will involve the &#163;584 million. I do not detract from anything that has been said or contained in that full regulatory impact assessment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="60116-12_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is quoting me in support of the fact that the amendment is not a satisfactory one and she is quite right. That is what I said. On the other hand, much of the information asked for in the amendment the Government can readily supply, but above all it will give the other place an opportunity to think again. If she is not willing to accept that, would she be willing to accept the recommendation that a Select Committee should look into costs? Without that, how will we know whether the benefits outweigh the costs?
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="60116-12_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, of course, we already have the benefit of the Public Accounts Committee; we have all the ways in which the Government are currently brought to account on costs. We do not see anything that entitles this piece of legislation to be taken outside that which would normally apply. Therefore, we believe that the currently available scrutiny will suffice in these circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>We believe that many of the net benefits, as I have indicated, are included in the gateway review. Noble Lords have seen the basis of that. The identity cards <br>&nbsp;<br>

programme is subject to that regular review under the Office of Government Commerce gateway review process. The review teams have full access to the business case for the identity cards programme. The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, asks me to say more about that. I can announce that, just last week, a further gateway review of the identity cards programme was completed and I am pleased to say that the review team concluded that the programme is in a fit state to proceed. The review team had full access to the business case, both for the setting up and for issuing identity cards and for anticipated uses of the scheme in both public and private sectors. Noble Lords will be familiar with the fact that the reason that the gateway process was adopted was to ensure that the Government better understood the risks involved and were better able to manage the process so that they did not fall into the error that used to happen when that scrutiny and that rigour was not in place. Therefore, we feel that this is a robust way of dealing with it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="60116-12_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Northesk: </b>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Baroness can satisfy my curiosity. At which traffic light, during the various stages, has the ID card been subject to review, and which traffic light has it been given for each of its stages, and which current stage has it just passed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="60116-12_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I think it has gone through its first two stages&#151;that is, nought and one&#151;and it has been given a clear bill of health to continue to the next stage. So the gateway review process is well on its way and is within the ambit of where it should be. The noble Earl will know that it is not usual for the gateway process details to be expanded upon or disclosed.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I believe that the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, complemented us on employing KPMG, or it might have been the noble Lord, Lord Peyton&#151;I think he said, &quot;At least we have done that&quot;. That process has been very important. KPMG carried out an independent review in November 2005 of the cost methodology and cost assumptions in the outline business case for the identity cards programme. That report recognised the high quality of the outline business case and confirmed that the majority of cost assumptions were based on appropriate benchmarks and analysis from the public sector and suppliers.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>The 15-page extract from the KPMG report has been placed in the Library of the House and includes all the report&#039;s recommendations on which we are now taking action. So there is an easy answer to those who want more detail of our costings. The reason, as I have made clear before, is to protect the taxpayer and the public who will benefit from the identity cards scheme. We simply must not provide information that could undermine obtaining the best value for money when we go out to open tender for the procurement of the different elements of the identity cards scheme.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, suggested that I was perhaps having what would colloquially be called &quot;a bad hair day&quot; when we last <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_460"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 460</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

debated this, but I can assure him that that was not the case. I know that the noble Lord would not wish me to trespass on the normal procurement rules, which of course his suggestion may well do. The identity card programme is conducting a market-sounding exercise in co-operation with Intellect. It has attracted widespread interest and positive feedback. It would be against the EU regulations and OGC rules to issue requirements to industry in advance of a notice to be published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>. This, as we have made clear, cannot occur before Royal Assent is granted. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, is not asking the Government to break any official procurement procedures; that would be far from his mind. We have done everything that we are able.


</p>

<a name="60116-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, also mentioned the Foreign Office. I assure noble Lords that what I said still stands: it is not intended that the Foreign Office should issue ID cards. ID cards will not be issued abroad. They are for UK residents and UK residents only. Passports will continue to be issued abroad. The biometric passport is coming. All parties agree on that. This is a cost that will be incurred even if not one single ID card is issued. The Foreign Office will remain responsible for issuing those biometric passports abroad, in accordance with the ordinary rules.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I therefore hope that I have demonstrated to the noble Lord that he is quite wrong when he says that the Home Office does not have faintest idea of the cost, or that it does not hold water. We do, and I respectfully suggest that we have offered a good answer as to why our figures are robust.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>There has been quite a lot of debate today about the LSE report. It is correct that the LSE&#039;s original assessment did not concur with our own. In its report the LSE&#151;which claims to be without political bias&#151;accuses the Government of secrecy. Throughout the development of the identity cards programme, Home Office officials have met a wide range of interested parties, including those representatives from the LSE. In addition to a very wide range of policy papers, research and other documents have been published. The policy on ID cards has been one of the most widely debated in recent years. We believe that it continues to command wide public support, despite the best efforts of critics to create what many see as a misleading, inaccurate and poorly researched approach.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>PA Consulting Group has confirmed that no approach was made to it from the LSE authors&#039; team. In any case, I suppose the LSE would know that such a meeting would put PA Consulting in breach of its client confidentiality. We have provided on our website an in-depth critique of the LSE&#039;s report. It is available, in detail, for those who wish to see the basis upon which we disagree with it.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Commercial confidentiality has been rather put to one side, as if it were not something of real import. I assure the House that it is. It is claimed that the commercial sensitivity of the detailed costs of the scheme holds no water and is not a matter of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_461"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 461</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

importance. This statement contradicts the behaviour of the market itself. The market-sounding process created by Intellect&#151;the UK trade association for the high-tech industry&#151;was established in recognition of the fact that both potential suppliers and the Government needed to keep elements of their planning, including costs, confidential. The high level of the engagement of suppliers in the identity cards programme market-sounding exercises run by Intellect appear to underline the industry&#039;s support for that concept. This statement also overlooks that the Government have already made it clear that the scheme will be self-financing. At today&#039;s prices, the unit cost for a joint passport and identity card is &#163;93, with a fee for a standalone ID card of &#163;30. We have already set the anticipated parameters that we would wish to see, in a way that is helpful and non-destructive.
<a name="time_13"></a>

</p>

<a name="60116-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I assure my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours that the Government have sought and included a great deal of independent expertise&#151;all the experts to which my noble friend Lady Henig referred&#151;and the independent assurance panel, the review project overall, independent experts in biometrics and many, many more. That is on top of the Government&#039;s scrutiny on commerce.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>We have had a full business case and a lot of detailed information. The Bill is enabling legislation to allow a system of ID cards to be introduced. The Bill will not be the final word. The Government will need to be reassured at every stage that there is sound financial viability for the scheme. Of course, expenditure on the identity cards programme is subject to the normal audit procedures of departmental expenditure through the National Audit Office and the Home Office agency to be established to issue identity cards and to incorporate the existing UK Passport Service, which will publish a corporate and business plan as well as annual accounts.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>On the detail of the amendments, I do not accept that there should be such an unprecedented review of the estimated costs of the identity card scheme covering a period of 10 years and the consequential costs falling to other departments before the Bill comes into force. I simply do not think that that is necessary. The level of scrutiny that has already been&#151;and will continue to be&#151;given to the project by my colleagues in Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury should not be forgotten. Such a major project inevitably benefits from a close level of Treasury scrutiny. So before any money can be spent, estimates have to be prepared and agreed with the Treasury. They must be approved by Parliament by being voted through the supply estimates process in the House of Commons either in the main or the supplementary estimates.
</p>

<a name="60116-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>I end by reminding the House that this is not the first time that an identity card scheme has been considered. In 1996, the then Conservative government proposed the introduction of identity cards and responded to a report from the Home Office committee in the other <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_462"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 462</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

place on whether there needed to be a detailed analysis of the net public expenditure effect of the proposed scheme. The answer given by the then government, published as part of Command Paper 3362 in August 1996, stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;We see no need to initiate any consultation on the expenditure involved as provision will be sought in estimates to be approved by Parliament&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>That is exactly what we intend to do. Just as a previous government were prepared to rest on the established procedures for government expenditure, so should we. This matter can be dealt with in its proper place by the other place and not by this House. On that basis, I very much hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, will not press her Amendments Nos. 1, 121, 122 and 123, flawed as they clearly are.

<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="60116-13_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply to the debate, which has been going on for more than two hours. I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. A majority of noble Lords have supported the amendment and I am grateful for that. A number of noble Lords raised points and I hope that all noble Lords will forgive me if I do not reiterate and respond to the detailed points which were made as I am conscious of the time that we have already spent on this small group of amendments.
</p>

<a name="60116-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The amendment is about transparency and openness in government. I do not believe that the Government have demonstrated those qualities in connection with the Bill. We have challenged them to provide information on start-up costs, capital costs, transaction volumes and many other details, but answers came there none. The Minister&#039;s story about this simply requiring marginal add-ons to the UK Passport Service is very difficult to swallow without details. There is still a major disparity between the Home Office figures and those produced by the London School of Economics. I remind noble Lords that the LSE&#039;s figures at the top end are more than three times those produced by the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60116-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Foulkes of Cumnock: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness and many other noble Lords have referred to this report as &quot;of the London School of Economics&quot;. Will she make it clear that it is not a report of that institution, but is produced by researchers who work in it? That is a substantial difference.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="60116-13_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I am happy to respond to that point. The report is by a research team operating within the London School of Economics. The noble Lord can see from the report the large number of people from the London School of Economics who are working on it. That is quite normal for research projects. As I said in my opening remarks&#151;when I do not believe the noble Lord was in his place&#151;the director of the London School of Economics has given his support to previous reports and to the report that was issued at the weekend. He stands by its description as coming from the London School of Economics.

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>We also asked for costs from other departments but drew a blank. We asked for details in a number of Written Questions but the Answers that we received largely indicated that many government departments, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, were not fully signed up to involvement in this scheme. That raises the big issue of whether other departments will engage with the scheme or whether it will remain a stand-alone Home Office scheme. There are unanswered questions there. We asked for information about the 44,000 private sector organisations which according to the market-sounding document are supposed to be engaging with the system. We asked how that will work and who will pay for it and bear the costs. There was silence.
</p>

<a name="60116-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Parliament deserves better. We must give the other place an opportunity to approve the costs and the benefits and to decide about affordability. The amendment is about the costs and benefits of the scheme and about parliamentary scrutiny. I have made it clear that the scrutiny to which I am referring is the scrutiny of the other place. The amendment is not about the principle of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, talked about a Joint Committee and that may well have been a good way for the Bill to have proceeded at an earlier stage, but the Government declined the opportunity to do that. This issue is so important that I wish to seek the opinion of the House.

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="60116-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury </b>   moved Amendment No. 4:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>Page 1, line 13, leave out &quot;or&quot; and insert &quot;recorded, stored and&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am happy to say that Amendment No. 4 can be moved with relative rapidity when compared with the previous debate on Amendment No. 1.
</p>

<a name="60116-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Everyone agrees that it is essential that the national identity register should be absolutely secure. Literally everyone&#151;and without equivocation I include the Government Front Bench&#151;has said that it is of the essence in this whole arrangement that the information and personal data in the register are absolutely secure and beyond being poached.


</p>

<a name="60116-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The amendment that I advance for the approval of the House&#151;it is supported by the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, and my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford&#151;would put into the keystone clause, Clause 1, the fact that, as well as security and reliability for the ascertainment and verification of registrable facts, the same characteristics of security and reliability should apply to the recording and storage of the registrable facts. It really is as simple as that.
</p>

<a name="60116-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>It is fair to point out that the Government are seeking on Report to amend Clause 24. Amendment No. 77 would place on the commissioner who oversees the register a duty to see the extent to which the confidentiality and integrity of information recorded in the register are observed in relation to the functions that are cast on the commissioner under Clause 24(2). The Government have brought forward that amendment from the Committee stage, when various amendments, including one of mine, sought to address that point. The Government&#039;s amendment would require that the four functions mentioned in Clause 24(2) should also have as a common theme running through them confidentiality and integrity of information.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_467"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 467</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>I believe that Amendment No. 4 is uncontroversial. I also believe that it is important that the words in the amendment are contained in Clause 1, which sets the tone of the whole Bill and, indeed, defines the statutory purposes by reference to which every other function under the Bill is carried out and construed. At present, Clause 1(3) states that the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;statutory purposes are to facilitate&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>and maintain,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;a record of registrable facts about individuals&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>It also talks of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;the provision of a secure and reliable method for registrable facts about such individuals to be ascertained or verified&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The facts are to be ascertained by the officials of the national identity register and will principally be verified by public authorities as defined in the Bill and, indeed, by the private sector users, of which the Home Office reckoned that there might be as many as 44,000, before the day is done, so to speak.
</p>

<a name="60116-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The words that I am seeking to have included would put the recording and storage of that precious and often sensitive information on the same footing as regards security and reliability of method as applies to the ascertainment and verification of that information. I have sought hard to find a reason why that would not be acceptable, but I have not been successful in that. I think that the amendment runs entirely with the tide of the Government&#039;s intentions, so I hope very much that they will accept it. I beg to move.
<a name="time_16"></a>
<a name="60116-14_time0"></a><h5>5.45 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="60116-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   My Lords, I speak in support of Amendment No. 4, to which I have added my name. As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, has explained, this amendment amends Clause 1(3)(b) to include the terms &quot;recorded&quot; and &quot;stored&quot;. The statutory purpose under subsection (3) would thus be to facilitate, by the maintenance of a record of registrable facts about individuals in the UK, the securing of a reliable method for such facts to be ascertained, recorded, stored and verified.
</p>

<a name="60116-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, that it should not be an option that, if the scheme is to work, an individual should not be ascertained or verified when in consideration of the public interest test. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> explanations of &quot;ascertained&quot;, which is &quot;determined by investigation, fixed&quot;, and of &quot;verified&quot;, which is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;proved to be true by verification&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>are significantly divergent in their meanings. The removal of the word &quot;or&quot; and the addition of the word &quot;and&quot; as well as &quot;recorded&quot; and &quot;stored&quot; place a firmer emphasis on the workings of the national identity register. It is no good if the information ascertained is false and this is then not picked up as it has not been verified. Indeed, this debate picks up the point that I raised in the last group following remarks made by my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell of Markyate. Meanwhile, the inclusion of the words <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_468"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 468</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&quot;recorded&quot; and &quot;stored&quot; simply put into the legislation the process that the Minister has been describing throughout the debates to date on the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60116-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>There is, as this House knows, widespread public concern over the facts to be gathered under the Bill. I am in full agreement with that concern, which is not confined to the accuracy of the information, vital though that is. The facts must, indeed, be accurate and up to date, but they also need to be secure from theft and misuse. We are all aware of the growing problem of identity theft and fraud and the importance of keeping personal information safe and private. That is doubly true of the information to be held under the Bill, requiring as it does so much information to be held in one place. As such, I support this simple, worthwhile amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="60116-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is seeking through his amendment to extend the reference to &quot;secure and reliable&quot; in Clause 1(3)(b) so as to refer to more than the method for which registrable facts about an individual can be ascertained or verified. I also understand the spirit in which he has moved the amendment. I dare say that we agree on the obvious point that the register must be both secure and reliable, but I am not convinced, having heard what he said, that this needs to be stated in the Bill in the way in which he suggests.
</p>

<a name="60116-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>Additionally, I am not convinced that Amendment No. 4 really achieves this, as Clause 1(3)(b) is concerned just with identification where that is in the public interest, whereas we would expect the register to be secure and reliable in every instance. I think that the noble Lord might want in any event to think about the drafting of the amendment.

</p>

<a name="60116-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>It goes pretty much without saying that the Secretary of State will want to ensure that the register is secure. Furthermore, once we have reached government Amendment No. 77 to clause 24, which the noble Lord mentioned, there will be a specific reference in the Bill to the National Identity Scheme Commissioner being able to review the arrangements for securing the confidentiality and integrity of information that is recorded in the register. I should also, once again, remind noble Lords that the data on the register must be held in a manner that is compliant with the Data Protection Act, as I am sure the noble Lord and the noble Baroness will be aware. The security of data is dealt with in some detail by   the seventh data protection principle, which provides that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>I feel strongly that we should not seek to reiterate in this Bill the obligations that already fall on the Secretary of State by virtue of the Data Protection Act. Nor would it be desirable to provide for parallel or overlapping obligations.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_469"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 469</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>We are often criticised for doing that in legislation&#151;at least, that is the assumption behind some amendments. We need to have faith in the detailed provisions that not just your Lordships&#039; House but another place has made about the protection of personal data.
</p>

<a name="60116-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>In any event, we think that we are covered. We think that the amendment is unnecessary and question at least one item in the noble Lord&#039;s drafting, although, in spirit, we are all there. The noble Lord is absolutely right to continue making the case for secure and reliable data and ensuring that they are properly protected. Although we understand the point, we think this amendment is unnecessary and ultimately undesirable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="60116-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for what he has said. Indeed, he made the point about the Data Protection Act last time.
</p>

<a name="60116-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>I tabled the amendment because this is a very particular Bill. It is about putting together a national central database; it is not about something wholly unrelated to data protection. Nothing could be more central to the Bill than the need to protect the data which find their way on to the register. The noble Lord more or less accepted that. It therefore seems bizarre to rely, by implication, on the provisions of another piece of legislation. There are nearly 42 pages in the Bill, and for us not to have, upfront, in Clause 1, a duty&#151;part of the statutory purpose&#151;to have secure storage and recording seems wrong and against common sense. On that basis, I should like to test the opinion of the House.

<br>
<br>
<a name="dec_1"></a>Resolved in the affirmative, and amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_472"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 472</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


<a name="time_18"></a>
<a name="60116-15_time0"></a><h5>6.05 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60116-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury </b>   moved Amendment No. 5:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>Page 2, line 2, at end insert &quot;the sentence for which may be imprisonment or detention&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment, which is also in the name of my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford, is another to do with Clause 1, which one cannot repeat too often is the key clause in the Bill. It often is, but particularly so in this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60116-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Amendment No. 5 affects subsection (4), which stipulates:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;For the purposes of this Act something is necessary in the public interest&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>that is the term of art&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;if, and only if, it is&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>then there are five categories, as I am sure noble Lords know. The second of those categories at present reads:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;for the purposes of the prevention or detection of crime&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>If my amendment is accepted by the Government or by the House, it would add:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;the sentence for which may be imprisonment or detention&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>What is in my mind is to try to avoid a whole lot of petty offences trammelling the workings of the Act.
</p>

<a name="60116-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I suppose one could envisage a potential misuse by an irresponsible policeman of this provision. Anybody in the police force or in one of the other authorities with powers under the Act can apply for information on the register if they come within one of these five categories. One might conceivably imagine a policeman improperly seeking to get access to an address or previous addresses of an individual. In order to provide an excuse for that, the individual concerned might be followed in order to ascertain whether the most puny of misdemeanours was committed, such as parking where he or she should not be parking or parking longer than he or she should be parking for. That would then fall within the provisions of paragraph (b). That, in turn, would open the doors of the registry to enquiry and extraction of all information in it except as in the paragraph excluding sensitive personal data.
</p>

<a name="60116-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>I thought fit to bring this before the House in order to deal with that. I also think that it would do no damage to what I take to be the mainstream purposes of the Government in bringing forward the Bill, because any offence of any seriousness will carry the possibility of imprisonment&#151;or, in the case of a minor, of detention&#151;even though as a matter of fact the magistrates would not contemplate imposing imprisonment, particularly for first offences.
</p>

<a name="60116-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>That is the reasoning and the purpose of the amendment. I hope the Government will find favour with it. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="60116-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   My Lords, I have sympathy with the amendment that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has just moved. As he explained, it would limit the current drafting of the Bill. For the purpose of the national identity system, Clause 1(4)(b) would be:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;for the purposes of the prevention or detection of crime the sentence for which may be imprisonment or detention&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The amendment leads on from detailed debates that    we had in Committee regarding both the Government&#039;s priority of the issues that they list as being in the public interest and both parties&#039; probing attempts to limit the Government&#039;s broad definition of crime to that of serious crime. Indeed, my noble friend Lady Anelay noted in Committee that the Minister referred specifically on Second Reading to &quot;serious crime&quot;, and not just to &quot;crime&quot;, despite the drafting of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60116-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and I are agreed that government drafting is too broad. However, on these Benches we are not convinced of what the final solution should be, as we are still in discussions with our colleagues in another place. As such, we cannot support the amendment, but I very much hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to outline exactly how they see this provision working. What definition of crime will it cover&#151;will it involve fraud, theft or assault? I am sure that the House will be pleased to have further detailed clarification on this matter following debates in Committee.


</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="60116-16_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendment. As I said at a previous stage, to limit the clause to serious, soccer-style offences would be silly because some useful information would be available. A lot of people would expect some smaller crimes to be cleared up. I know that everyone says that the register will be leakage-proof, but we have to assume that that possibility always exists. To raise the threshold of crime at which the register can be accessed to an offence which might attract imprisonment will allay worries that people would obtain data from it for a frivolous purpose, which would lead to a leakage of data. I heartily support the amendment. It sets the threshold at the right level.
</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="60116-16_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the current provisions are needed. Noble Lords will know that false identities underpin much of the crime that takes place in this country, from volume crime to serious organised crimes. Criminals, especially those who are engaged in organised crime, are extremely adept at circumventing measures that have been put in place to limit their activities. I shall give noble Lords an example. Our research shows that about 60 per cent of drivers who are stopped provide false details. So it is very difficult when one is dealing just with serious crime to confine the provision in the way that the noble Lord suggests.
</p>

<a name="60116-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Amendment No. 5 provides that the register could be used only,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;for the purposes of the prevention or detection of crime, the sentence for which may be imprisonment or detention&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_474"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 474</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>This would be an arbitrary limit and it should be rejected for the same reasons as those for which we rejected the suggestion in Committee to add the limit of serious crime. Crime of whatever nature needs to be addressed. It would not be appropriate to limit access to the register by preventing information being available where a police investigation relates to a non-imprisonable criminal offence. Such offences could include those in Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986&#151;that is, causing harassment, alarm or distress&#151;which carry a maximum penalty of a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale, which is &#163;1,000. Under that act, a person is guilty of an offence if he uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or  displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby. That offence can affect a number of people in a very disadvantageous way.
</p>

<a name="60116-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a> Another example is Section 24 of the Firearms Act. The offence of giving a shotgun to a person under 15 or supplying an air weapon to a person under 17 would not warrant imprisonment, but we could wish the police to have access to that information. I am sure that your Lordships could think of other examples. In addition, we recognise that it may not always be possible for the police to predict what the final charge would be and whether it would lead to an offence punishable by imprisonment. Indeed, in looking to prevent crime, they may end up bringing no charges at all because identity might exclude somebody from the scene.

</p>

<a name="60116-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>There have been many cases where it has transpired that individuals who were suspected of what appeared to be very trivial offences such as traffic offences&#151;I have alluded to the fact that many people do not tell the truth about their identity&#151;were involved in much more serious crime or were wanted on other grounds; for example, immigration offences. Indeed, there have been cases of individuals subsequently being charged with very serious offences, involving terrorism or murder, where the initial police involvement was in relation to a minor offence. If the amendment were passed, it would preclude any check in respect of such offences against the national identity register. I am sure that no noble Lord would like to see that happen.
</p>

<a name="60116-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>We do not accept that anyone would want that, and we do not accept that it would be right to tie the hands of the police in the way proposed in this amendment. The restriction that is suggested by Amendment No. 5 is both unworkable and unnecessary. I therefore invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="60116-16_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for her full defence of the status quo.

</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="60116-16_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </b>   moved Amendment No. 6:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>Page 2, line 6, leave out &quot;securing the efficient and effective provision of&quot; and insert &quot;preventing illegal or fraudulent access to&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the objective of the amendment is to focus on the Government&#039;s failure to meet one of the five reasonable tests which we set out at the beginning of our debates on the Bill. We pointed out that the Government must make clear not only the detail of the specific purposes for which an ID card would be required, but which of those purposes are priorities, otherwise it will be difficult for us to assess them. The Government failed to do that adequately in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60116-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Clause 1(4) proposes that the definition of what is necessary in the public interest should encompass anything that is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;for the purpose of securing the efficient and effective provision of public services&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I would have thought that the efficient and effective provision of public services embraces the totality of government&#039;s duty in the area of public services. This paragraph is framed so widely that it would enable identity cards to be required in accessing literally any public service, so long as the Government claimed that it was in the interests of efficiency. It is the ultimate catch-all paragraph and, as such, it is entirely unsuitable to governing a Bill whose provisions have such a fundamental effect on the relations between the state and the citizen. Under it, everything from a registration of a birth to a registration of a death, from the arrival at the gates of a nursery to collecting a pension, could be made dependent on being registered. As the Minister made clear in the careful letter which she kindly sent to noble Lords last week, the paragraph covers everything under full compulsion, including being able to access a vast array of free health services.
</p>

<a name="60116-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>In that way, within 10 years or so on the Government&#039;s current planning, an audit trail of the daily lives of every citizen could be built up. That is a giant step indeed. It should be one of the last steps that we take, when all the legitimate doubts about the costs, efficacy, security and scope of the scheme have been set to rest&#151;if, as I doubt from hearing earlier debates, they can ever be set to rest. It should certainly not be one of the first steps. We should not permit the Government to do everything they wish in the name of efficiency. We should not simply leave the matter to regulations; it would be far better to set out limits in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60116-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>Amendment No. 6 tries to offer a solution. It creates the active purpose of policing crime and fraud in Clause 1(4)(e); that is, something much more limited and definable than a general purpose of being &quot;efficient&quot;. We agree with the Government that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_476"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 476</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

citizens of this country would see any attack on the fraudulent access to services as being a useful step. There are more efficient ways of doing that than this Bill, but that is an argument for Second Reading and Committee, not for today. Surely, if the Government&#039;s method has any justification at all, it cannot be the creation and maintenance of a vast audit trail, but the specific purpose of preventing illegal and fraudulent access to services, which is, after all, what the Government originally told us this Bill would be all about when we started this process some considerable time ago.
</p>

<a name="60116-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>If the purpose of the scheme were not the general management provision in subsection 4(a), but were the more targeted, and frankly more necessary, purpose that I propose, we would end up designing an entirely different system. I suspect that it would be cheaper, more effective and more efficient than the one before us today. The register and ID cards risk becoming an end in themselves and not a solution. It is important to put this more careful definition in the Bill. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="60116-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I support and have added my name to the amendment. I agree with every word that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said. The fifth subdivision of the definition of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;necessary in the public interest&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>is different in kind from the other four. They involve a degree of illegality. This does not. If we were to leave this in the Bill, the national register would be open to anyone at any time for any information on it, provided they fall within the extremely broad ambit of who has access to that data.
</p>

<a name="60116-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>I would go as far as to say that the amendment is one of the most important that could be conceived for keeping the scope of the national register within some sort of bounds. It is very dangerous&#151;when you get sunk into a Bill such as this, you constantly think of those working within the establishment, perhaps forgetting that sometimes information is the property of the citizen, and that our privacy of our information is a considerable civic liberty which we should not impinge on in the way that this paragraph would allow. I strongly support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="60116-17_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, funnily enough, I do not support the amendment in some ways. If we were stuck with just the national identity register, then the amendment would be correct and it should be supported, because I do not think that the national identity register will secure,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;the efficient and effective provision of public services&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>If the Government want to prevent duplicate benefit fraud, for example, there is logic to a central, hierarchical ID scheme controlled by the Government. But if that is what they are after, they should be honest and accept the amendment. If they really wanted to secure, the efficient and effective provision of public services, which I would like to see, a national identity register is not needed, and instead we should have federated identity schemes that local authorities and so <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_477"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 477</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on could join, whereby citizens control their identities and it is unnecessary to hold the information on a central register.
</p>

<a name="60116-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>I would like the Bill changed to include that acceptable alternative, and when the cost benefit analysis was done, the Government would work out that they could drop the central register and move to a federated identity commissioning scheme that would enable that efficient and effective provision of public services. I am torn, because I would like to table an amendment relating to a federated ID scheme and leave the Bill as it is to get rid of the national identity register. But I am sure that that will not happen, and in that case this amendment is more honest.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="60116-17_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, if I thought that the purpose of the Government&#039;s wording was to enable government departments to trawl through identities and discover people who were not receiving the benefits to which they were entitled, I would support it&#151;but I am pretty sure that that is not their intention. If they want to stop benefit fraud, they should say so and not use words that indicate something else.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="60116-17_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I tell the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that this Government have done a considerable amount to try to make sure that those who are entitled to receive benefit but do not claim it have the advantage of claiming it. He will know that we have put in place schemes to assist particularly those who are disadvantaged by age and disability&#151;there is cross-checking made across that whole area to try to ensure that, for example, a person with a disability who needs extra money actually gets it. I heard the noble Lord&#039;s cynicism, but I assure noble Lords that this Government have already taken many steps to try to make sure that those who are entitled to benefit receive it&#151;not least because if they receive benefit that takes them above the poverty threshold they do not get so ill and we can look after them better.
</p>

<a name="60116-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Perhaps we may stick to the amendment. It is not necessary, because narrowing the public interest to preventing illegal or fraudulent access to public services would not allow us the full benefit of the Bill. I should reiterate a point in relation to the register. I know that many people have said much about the register, but the database that we will have in relation to biometric passports will mean that that information will be held and available in any event. We need to understand that, and we would be looking to use this scheme to help to make the delivery of public services better. That means helping to deliver services more efficiently and effectively in the interest of the public as taxpayers and as users of services. Inefficiency in public services is of no benefit to anyone.
</p>

<a name="60116-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Transforming public services will be helped by being able to provide a secure, reliable and fast way of confirming identity. That is why we believe it would be wrong to regard the use of identity cards as simply a guard against fraud. Combating fraud will be one of the purposes of the identity cards scheme&#151;a very important one&#151;but not the only one.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_478"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 478</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>We should not limit the use of identity cards in helping to deliver better public services. It is not just a question of combating fraudulent use of public services; it is also about helping to transform those services. We believe that the public will want the introduction of identity cards to be used as a way of helping public services to deliver quicker and better services. Why should we have to keep filling in different forms with details of our name and address? If production of an identity card when seeking access to a public service can confirm our identity quickly and easily, surely we should be aiming to provide that. If producing an identity card enables address details to be confirmed, that will help both the public service and the applicant for that service.
</p>

<a name="60116-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>I have spoken previously about the Criminal Records Bureau, which has to be certain of the identity of anyone who is seeking a criminal records check. However, mistakes are made in identifying people, and since 2004 there have been over 1,000 occasions where applicant details supplied by the Criminal Records Bureau to the police led to conviction details being matched mistakenly with an applicant. If one considers the number of John James Smiths who may have been born on any given date in any hospital in our country, one can see the way that mistakes can arise. An identity card check would provide a much more reliable method of confirming the person&#039;s true identity and so avoid those kinds of mistakes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="60116-17_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry to intervene, but as the police national computer has the 10 fingerprints of applicants, why were they not checked? Or when they were checked, why was the biometric not good enough? Since the police national computer fingerprints are kept to a higher standard than those proposed on the new national identity register, I do not see how those 1,000 people slipped through, and if they did, it does not bode well for the future register.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="60116-17_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the way in which such checks have sometimes gone awry has been when there were very similar data such as very similar addresses, and human error has occurred in the system. It is by no means a matter of pride, because every effort is made to try to make sure that we eradicate mistakes. We believe that it would be appropriate to use the new register in a way that would make those mistakes more difficult. An identity card check would provide a much more reliable method of confirming a person&#039;s true identity and help to avert such mistakes.
</p>

<a name="60116-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>As I have said previously, when it comes to any requirement to use identity cards to access public services, there are already provisions and safeguards in the Bill at Clauses 15 and 16. By restricting the statutory purposes of the Bill and the scheme therefore to only combating illegal or fraudulent access to public services, we would define it far too narrowly and would risk restricting the usefulness of the scheme to the public.

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 479</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a> I hear what the noble Baroness says about tracking data, but she knows as well as I do that, with the use of CCTV cameras, with our bank details from HSBC and other banks, and with the clutch of store cards that some of us have in our pockets from Tesco, Sainsbury&#039;s and Waitrose, there is a huge amount of data about where we go and what we do. It is not proposed that that sort of data will be utilised as the noble Baroness fears; this register will enable us simply to advance the proper use and efficiency of public services in a way that we believe would be very helpful to members of the public.

<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="60116-17_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, I hope the Minister will forgive me, but I am confused at a much higher level than those on the Front Benches. Is she saying that all the information will be on one register, and will all that information be transferred to one identity card&#151;or will there be several identity cards?
</p>




<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="60116-17_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, there is going to be only the one identity card. I was merely responding to the suggestion made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that it would be a way in which to track our day-to-day business, every second of the day. I simply sought to suggest that that is happening already through other forms and that it is not the purpose for which we are going to use the register. The concerns that the noble Baroness expressed are not really justified, as there are perfectly proper administrative changes that we could make through using this register which would be helpful to the citizen to ensure that they were not unnecessarily burdened by administrative production of matters that could very easily be dealt with by the ID card. That is all that I was seeking to suggest; the noble Baroness need not worry about that.

<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="60116-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, it was a fairly simple question. I should like to have an identity card, but will all the data on me, on the central register, be on my identity card&#151;yes or no?
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="60116-18_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   No, my Lords, your identity card will be able to identify you, and those who wish to verify your identity will be able to do so by checking against the register.
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="60116-18_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, we are talking at this stage about a national identity register that is voluntary. Under those circumstances, the claims that the Minister is making for the register in respect of more efficient public services really cannot add up, can they? They apply properly only if you have a compulsory register.
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="60116-18_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I do not intend to get up again. I should not be getting up and down, as this is Report. But I can say to the noble Lord that the whole scheme is predicated on the basis that it will become compulsory in the long term. For the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_480"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 480</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reasons I have given, these issues are things that we believe will be extremely helpful, and we will derive benefit from them. All the data will not be on the card; there is a limited amount, set out in affirmative regulations, to which we shall come later.
</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="60116-18_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part. I hear exactly what the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, says: the Government&#039;s scheme would not be his best choice, as he would go for a federated scheme which would find a different way of doing things. But we are where we are, and what I am trying to do is, exactly as he perceives, to create a more transparent system, which, if the Bill goes through unaltered, will work slightly better than the one we have now.
</p>

<a name="60116-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The Minister says that I should still my beating heart and that I am not to worry because we are already in a surveillance society, with CCTV cameras and so on; she says, &quot;Let&#039;s just put it all together and make it easy for the Government to have complete control and you don&#039;t need to worry any more&quot;. The trouble is that I do worry. What the Government propose is more than a straightforward register; it is the audit trail that concerns me. The Minister says that nothing would be put on the audit trail that is not already there; it is simply disseminated in various places.
</p>

<a name="60116-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>Last week, I attended a clinic in Woking, which is one of those community hospitals&#151;and at my great age, sadly, I did not have to make use of the family planning clinic, which was in the room next to me. But I was in conversation with young people in their late teens, who were there without their parents&#039; knowledge and were concerned that they had a sexually transmitted disease. They said that that particular clinic gave them the confidence and freedom to be able to seek advice. Perhaps they would get advice and be treated; it may well be that they would be told that they did not have anything to worry about. But they had gone there because there was no tracking of them. I considered that&#151;and, to me, it is one of the crucial issues. One ought to be able to give people the opportunity to retain their anonymity and privacy when it is right to do so. That is why we need to narrow the definition here; as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, says, we need to keep the scope of the register within reasonable bounds. My amendment is an attempt to do that. I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<a name="60116-18_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal </b>   moved Amendment No. 7:


</p>

</ul>
<p>

&quot;(   )   the address of his principal place of residence in the United Kingdom;

<br>
(   )   the address of every other place in the United Kingdom or elsewhere where he has a place of residence;


<br>
(   )   where in the United Kingdom and elsewhere he has previously been resident;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_123"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I hope these government amendments will find favour with noble Lords opposite, not least because in the main they respond to requests and pleas from Members all around the House. With the leave of the House, I will speak also to government Amendments Nos. 27 and 117, as well as to Amendments Nos. 8, 10, 25 and 26, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I hope that it will be clear that government Amendment No. 7, which introduces a new form of words to replace paragraphs (b) and (c) of Clause 1(5), responds to points raised by the noble Baroness and noble Lords opposite in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>I hope that we have demonstrated that we are a listening Government. Therefore, we have listened carefully and responded. We have been persuaded that it would make the Bill clearer and remove any doubt if we inserted a specific reference to principal residence in this subsection; and that we should also provide for the possibility of holding an address outside the United Kingdom. Although the national identity register is intended for United Kingdom residents, there could easily be cases, such as foreign students, for whom it might make sense to retain an address abroad and for this to be held on the register. I very much hope that your Lordships will accept this amendment and the consequential amendments, Amendment No. 27 to Schedule 1, and Amendment No. 117 to Clause 43.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Amendment No. 27 acts in a slightly different way from Amendments Nos. 25 and 26, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, to allow addresses outside the United Kingdom to be held on the register by including them in Schedule 1, and I hope, therefore, that she will agree not to move those amendments.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Amendment No. 8, in the name of the noble Baroness, as an amendment to government Amendment No. 7, is concerned with the aspect of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_484"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 484</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Bill which allows address history to be held on the national identity register as part of the registrable facts. We made clear in Committee that applicants for identity cards will be asked for information about current principal address, any current alternative address and previous addresses. However, there will be no need to ask about every single address at which they have lived since they were born and in nearly every case we would not expect to ask people for details of where they have lived any earlier than six years previously. I know that that causes the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, some concern.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>However, it would be wrong to write a limit of six years into the Bill. Previous addresses are needed to enable a background check to be made to ensure that a gold standard of identity is entered into the register. There may be some cases where it is just not possible to check the past six years but for which there might be earlier information available&#151;for example, someone who has been working abroad but has an earlier address history in the United Kingdom. We should also bear in mind that it is much harder for a fraudster to create false historic records and so if there were any doubt over an applicant&#039;s true identity a check back on evidence of where they have lived, say, earlier than six years ago might help to resolve those doubts.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>In addition, once an identity card has been issued, historic data of information previously recorded will continue to be held on the register so long as it is consistent with the statutory purposes. That means being able to retain information on previous addresses. Thus, if the police were investigating a crime that had taken place in the past, they should be able to seek information about an individual&#039;s previous addresses which could then be provided in accordance with Clause 19.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>Of course, previous addresses would be archive information and so would not be part of the current record and could not be provided when a person consented to an identity check against the register under Clause 14. We amended the Bill from the version introduced before the election so that previous addresses are not now held in the information recorded in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 but could be provided under Clause 14. This means that it would not be possible for, say, a commercial organisation to seek provision of an individual&#039;s complete address history on the national identity register even with that person&#039;s consent.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><i>In extremis</i>, if, say, someone wanted to be reminded of previous address details that they had forgotten they could obtain it by making a Data Protection Act data subject access request. I hope that your Lordships will accept that holding address history on the register will be a help rather than a hindrance.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Amendment No. 10 would preclude treating as a place of residence the residential accommodation at a place of higher education. We do not see the need to do that and especially not to place such a detailed provision in the Bill. Some students may want to continue to regard their parents&#039; address as their principal one while others may prefer to nominate <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_485"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 485</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

their term-time address whether in halls of residence or private accommodation. The details on which addresses should be recorded should be left to the individual and any detailed provisions on what information needs to be provided to update address information on the register including any exceptions should be left to the regulations which will be made under Clause 12.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>I do not believe that it would be helpful to be constrained by the provisions in the noble Baroness&#039;s amendments and I ask her, therefore, to withdraw Amendment No. 8. I hope that she will find that we have taken the meat of her amendments and ensured that it is present in the Bill; as indeed we have taken in the comments made by noble Lords around the House of the same import. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="60116-19_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </b>   moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 7, Amendment No. 8:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>Line 6, after &quot;where&quot; insert &quot;, during the last 6 years,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_125"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the noble Baroness opened by saying she hoped they were a listening Government and that their amendments have been tabled in response to debates in Committee. I hope that I may say without being opposed by any of my noble colleagues that we always think that the noble Baroness is a listening Minister. Our difficulty is that she does not run the Government. I hope that that does not kill her career stone dead today. We know full well that there are times when she listens but does not agree with us. There are times when she listens and agrees but is unable to carry the matter into legislation. That is one of the interesting facets of a political life. In most of these amendments, the noble Baroness has met the concerns we expressed. I welcome Amendment No. 7 in so far as it does that. My amendments in these groups today are probing in nature and are not intended to go further than that.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>On Amendment No. 8, the noble Baroness has taken us much further today than was possible in Committee or in another place. She has talked about some of the exceptions where the Government would need to consider a period before six years&#151;exceptions that, so far as I am aware, have not been debated previously. I shall consider what she said because she has adduced very reasonable arguments. There could be people without any history in this country in the past six years. They may have been homeless or rootless during that time and are unable to produce that information. For whatever reasons, they may have historic evidence overseas. I accept that that is a good argument.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>There are other circumstances in which it is still intrusive as a matter of course to require that people should go back beyond six years. I do not intend to revamp the Committee stage argument: we pointed out how onerous it could be on individuals to go back 40 or 50 years. However, I recall the noble Baroness saying&#151;I do not wish to put words into her mouth&#151;that perhaps as a matter of good practice the Government might say that if you have lived somewhere for less than three months the place or the dates might not have to be revealed. That is in my <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_486"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 486</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mind. I can then move on to the way in which she has dealt with my other amendments. I am grateful to her for that.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>My amendment on students was badly drafted. I sought to put down words which fairly reflected some of the concerns put to me by universities. It does not cover all the issues raised but it was the only one I could find that was admissible. I was intrigued to hear the Minister say that students might wish to choose either their home or college address. I understand the sense in that; however, I suspect that they would not live more than three months at a time at their college address; therefore, the college address might be exempted. I shall need to consider that issue further and perhaps talk to the noble Baroness.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Universities and colleges have been concerned about how students might be affected. I am aware that the government would be in great difficulty in exempting students <i>per se</i> because there are many different kinds of students. As a very mature student in my late 30s, I did a taught MA when I was living at home. Other students who had taken lodgings for that time kept their original address. Many of those students were sponsored civil servants. I know that the Government are in a difficult position but the statement in the Bill is very wide. I have been trying to get some assurance for outside bodies that at least their concerns are recognised. The noble Baroness has gone some way towards doing that today, and I shall have to think very carefully about what she said about Amendment No. 10.


</p>

<a name="60116-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The noble Baroness has exactly met my queries with regard to Amendments Nos. 25 and 26, although perhaps for a reason different from mine. I am very happy with what she said. I thought that my amendment and that moved by the noble Baroness might also have a relevance to the position of UK citizens. During our debates in Committee, my noble friend Lord Northesk mentioned that he sometimes lives in the United States. Indeed, I know that the noble Baroness&#039;s noble friend, the noble Lord, Lord Acton&#151;he is not in his place so I will let him know afterwards that I referred to him by name&#151;gives in <i>Dod&#039;s</i> as his principal address an address in the USA, perfectly properly. So I accept that her amendment is right but perhaps for different reasons.
</p>

<a name="60116-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Overall, I think that we need to consider a little further&#151;perhaps by debate; it may not be necessary to do so by way of a later amendment&#151;how far back one goes in tracking addresses and why. However, I accept the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment today and I certainly shall not press my Amendment No.8, although as a matter of course I have to beg to move.

<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="60116-20_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for government Amendment No. 7 because it certainly addresses one of the issues that I raised earlier and I am content with the way in which it is now left. I want to make two short comments. One is in relation to Amendment No. 8 in the names of the noble Baronesses, Lady Anelay of St Johns and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_487"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 487</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lady Seccombe. I heard what the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said about six years being too short a period in some circumstances. On the other hand, it seems to me to be highly desirable to have some limit on how far back one can search for information to go on the register. A number of outside commentators have made critical remarks about the open-ended time in terms of the history of each individual who is to be on the register, and I think that that needs further thought by the Government.
</p>

<a name="60116-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>My other point is in respect of Amendment No. 10, also in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, and I declare an interest as Chancellor of Essex University. Again, I am happy that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, will think more about this matter&#151;in conjunction, I hope, with the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland&#151;because we have to do something about the constant movement of students from one accommodation to another. In the course of a four-year degree, one can easily have four separate addresses and that is a burden, particularly at a university such as Essex, which has a huge proportion of foreign students. It may sound trivial but I believe that it is an altogether unnecessary extra burden that everyone, including the poor old registrar, can do without. I hope very much that some formula might be arrived at in time for the final stage of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="60116-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, I want to make one general point and ask one specific question. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her elaboration today of the explanation that she gave in Committee on 16 November and for the improvements that she has introduced in these amendments. Like the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, I am not entirely happy that we do not have a time limit of six years or some period because, even with the limited usage that the noble Baroness has described, I think that it will be difficult for people always to produce evidence of where they have lived, even without dates, for periods of more than six years. That will particularly be the case if they are asked to reinforce the story that they have told in order to provide what the noble Baroness described on a previous occasion as the &quot;gold standard&quot;. I can see that some people living abroad might find it quite difficult to give satisfactory evidence or even to be certain themselves that they were being accurate, and they could then find their whole position prejudiced when in fact they were utterly honest and straightforward. So I am concerned and I am not entirely sure that we have the right answer.
</p>

<a name="60116-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>My specific question comes from rereading the <i>Official Report</i> of the debate on 16 November. The noble Baroness is quoted as saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;We will prescribe the period for which we will ask for information on previous addresses as provided at paragraph 1(h) of Schedule 1&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16/11/05; col. 1167.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>But there is no paragraph 1(h) of Schedule 1. I am not sure how this has arisen and to what the noble Baroness is referring. As she said a few moments ago, the regulations will come under Clause 12, and presumably any details that she sets out will come in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_488"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 488</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those regulations. So I am not sure how paragraph 1(h) of Schedule 1, existing or not, has crept into the whole matter, and I should be grateful for clarification.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="60116-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for the effort that she has made because I was going through a soul-searching exercise and thinking that I would like to know the names and addresses of all the places where I have lived. Those of us who have worked in international organisations and have been brought up internationally forget addresses very quickly. The noble Baroness has addressed the issue but I have certain concerns regarding the terminology. The word &quot;resident&quot; is used but it can sometimes be misinterpreted as &quot;being resident&quot; or &quot;ordinary resident&quot; and it may get confused with one&#039;s original status in life. That causes concerns for people who have dual passports and international people.
</p>

<a name="60116-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Those who have worked in multinational or international organisations will often have been on secondments for a maximum period of two years. In some cases in my former group, the secondment was to the cruise liners, where effectively you lived for a period of time, often with no separate residence. The same would often apply to bachelors in the Navy, who would regard the ship as their home and would have no separate residence. I am not saying that there is any confusion but I should have preferred it if we had stuck to the phrase &quot;where they have lived for a reasonable period of time&quot; rather than using the word &quot;resident&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60116-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>This is a difficult issue because we will still have all the terrible problems that we read about from time to time in newspapers of a married man cohabiting in another house with someone else and denying that that is his permanent residence. I think that the problem of where people are came up when we originally looked at the poll tax. I am not suggesting that the amendment moved by the noble Baroness is not acceptable because she has really tried, but I think that all sorts of problems may emerge later which could cause individuals harm.
</p>

<a name="60116-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Therefore, I wonder whether it might be possible to define the word &quot;residence&quot; more accurately and change it to, say, &quot;where someone has lived for a reasonable period of time&quot;. Whether it is six or five years does not matter. This also applies to multinational students&#151;not those from some of the countries nearer to home but those from the third world and others, who often will not have a full address.
</p>

<a name="60116-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Once, in Cairo, I tried to produce a street map with addresses because there were no addresses. It was a case of turn right at wherever it might be&#151;there were no traffic lights. That happens in many areas. The latest reports produced by the immigration people on a number of residents of the United Kingdom or those born abroad in some of the African countries show that they do not have addresses. I am not trying to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_489"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 489</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

make difficulties; I just want to point out that some issues which may appear relatively simple are not as simple as we would like to believe.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="60116-20_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, I found myself looking at Amendment No. 7 from the point of view of the person who was registering. Are the Government intending to have a fairly precise instruction regarding previous addresses? From conversations that I have had with people about the Bill, I have discovered that what worries them most is the requirement to give all their previous addresses. They say that they cannot remember what they were and they mention various other things, such as my noble friend has just mentioned. Do the Government intend to have a form with fairly precise instructions so that if people have to give much earlier addresses than others, they will know who they are and what they have to do? I think that that is important.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="60116-20_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, I do not mean to cause difficulties; I am trying to be helpful to the noble Baroness&#151;the listening Minister. Following what the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, said, I am looking at Amendment No. 17 which is in the same group. It is a definition in the general interpretation clause, Clause 43. It defines &quot;place of residence&quot; and &quot;resides&quot; and there is an amendment to that which says &quot;and cognate expressions&quot;. Of course, it does not define the word &quot;resident&quot; itself, so that may need to be put in. I was not sure what a &quot;cognate expression&quot; was and I wondered whether it included &quot;stayed&quot; or &quot;lived&quot; but not &quot;domiciled&quot;. I hope that it does not include &quot;domiciled&quot;, or I can see problems with the tax authorities and much difficulty in getting people to register things, which is the whole intention.
</p>

<a name="60116-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>However, my attention was drawn to the fact that all this is subject to regulations under subsection (10) of the same Clause 43, regulations defining what an address is. That has been worrying me slightly because under Clause 12 that would presumably apply from the moment the first person is added forcibly, when they are issued with a new passport, to the national identity register. That is the requirement to notify any changes. It will be an offence attracting a &#163;10,000 civil penalty should one not notify any changes. Presumably that will affect people about two years after the start; otherwise the register will be out of date before the last people are put on it.
</p>

<a name="60116-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>What is a valid address for the regulations? This needs to be looked at because at the moment the effort to bring together the Royal Mail postal address database, the Ordnance Survey address point database and the land and property gazetteers&#151;there is the LLPG and the NLPG&#151;has foundered under copyright problems. Suddenly people realise that there is value in the property rights and, with things being hived off to agencies, they cannot afford to lose value under company law. Equally, local authorities are always starved of cash. So, if they are sitting on something that might be valuable, such as the LLPG, they will want money for it. All that will have to be gone through and dealt with. Otherwise, how will one <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_490"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 490</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

define a valid address? If someone does not know what is a valid address or it is made very difficult to define a valid address, some people will attract fines of &#163;1,000 from day one. The first people on the register will probably be those with good addresses, so one may have two or three years in which to sort it out, but it is the wrong basis on which to proceed.
</p>

<a name="60116-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>One also has to decide how one will define valid overseas addresses. I am just pointing out that in the regulations made under Clause 43(10), although they are not actually dealt with, one needs to start thinking about what will replace the national spatial address infrastructure. Otherwise, we will have complicated regulations and we really will not know how to register a Gypsy in a lay-by or a tramp in a barn or all sorts of other people who one would eventually want to register.

<a name="60116-21_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am pleased that at least on this occasion I have given a modicum of satisfaction. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that the power to make regulations about addresses to be regarded as &quot;places of residence&quot; and &quot;principal place of residence&quot; is provided under Clause 43(10), as the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, has just indicated. I hope I have made it clear that students will have the option of keeping on the register their home address or a term-time address or both. That will give them some security. Some students, as the noble Baroness knows, are fortunate enough to stay at one address for their three or four years of study, but some have to change all the time as the rent goes up and down and according to what they can or cannot afford. Therefore, there is some mix and match. These provisions have been cast in a way that responds to the reality of people&#039;s lives. We hope that it will meet that.
</p>

<a name="60116-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, is right to say that I made reference to paragraph 1(h). That referred to the paragraph on previous addresses under the old draft. It was paragraph 1(h). The Bill was changed to remove the previous addresses which will be recorded in historic information in paragraph 5(a). I believe that that is how the confusion occurred. If I did that at the wrong stage, I certainly apologise. I think that the Bill was actually changed in the Commons and not here, but I am unsure about that. That is the reason for the difference, though, if I may respectfully say so, it is a difference without a difference.
</p>

<a name="60116-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>The noble Earl suggested that the penalty was &#163;10,000. It is not&#151;it is &#163;1,000. I hope that the noble Earl will remember that on the last occasion when we debated this, I spoke about the ease with which we hoped addresses could be changed&#151;the facilities of trying to do it online and making it swift and easy&#151;so that it will not be too cumbersome or burdensome.
</p>

<a name="60116-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The noble Earl also raised the issue of &quot;cognate expression&quot;, which means a variant of &quot;reside&quot;, including &quot;resident&quot;. It does not really affect &quot;domicile&quot;. We think that we have alighted on the correct phrase.

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>On the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, we shall do everything we can to bring clarity, just as we do with passports. The noble Baroness will know that there are guidance notes to help one through that. Another advantage that we shall have is that there will be an interview to try to ensure that the information that goes on to the register is correct. People will be helped. The whole import of this is not to trick or confuse people; it is to try to get from them the just information that they will need to be able to identify themselves accurately in the future. We hope that that will be done sympathetically and that it will take into account the reality of the way in which people live their lives, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has described in the past. If one has a peripatetic existence, it is not surprising that one does not remember exactly all the addresses where one has lived. The noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, gave us a graphic example of why that is the case.
</p>

<a name="60116-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>We think that the amendments meet the situation. I understand the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury. We think that the combination of the regulations, the guidance notes that will go out and the interview will enable us to achieve the correct balance. The amendments that I have tabled today will help us to do that. I absolutely agree with the concerns that were raised by noble Lords in the debates on these issues and that is why we have responded to them in a practical and pragmatic way through these amendments.

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="60116-21_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I shall certainly think further on what she has said about students. As she said, there is a choice. The only reason why I do not hold up my hands and concede at this stage is that I want to go back to the university and further education sector to check that they are happy. I suspect that they will be content.
</p>

<a name="60116-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>I was interested in what my noble friend Lord Selsdon said about those from overseas not being able to give what we consider to be an address. I think we have referred to this before in Committee. One can come from deepest Darfur and not be able to give what is an accepted address here. I recognise that the Home Office has to deal with this with regard to those who seek asylum in this country. The information that the noble Baroness has given in Committee and on Report is such that, through the interview system, there should be a way of eliciting sufficient information to acquire the kind of corroboration that will stand up. We shall see if this works only when it is operational and we shall have to look at the reporting system then.

</p>

<a name="60116-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The question of what information overseas visitors should be required to supply, and when, is central not only to the functioning of the scheme but also to the public consent in the scheme. I have no doubt that most British people think that the main purpose of the scheme is to control the activities of potential terrorists coming from abroad to settle here, and do not understand that short-term settlers are to be among the very few people not to be included. Indeed, Clause 2&#151;which we will come to&#151;is explicitly drafted to exclude these people. It seems an odd idea to spend billions of pounds&#151;we should not forget that &#163;10 billion would build 430 new secondary schools&#151;to run a surveillance system of UK citizens while excluding short-term foreign visitors.
</p>

<a name="60116-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The schedule to the Bill implies that the register may record the number of a passport or identity card issued abroad, but should it necessarily do so? If any UK citizen who does not have a passport wants to leave our country&#151;that will probably involve 600,000 people next year, rising to 4.5 million a year by 2008&#151;is going to be made to attend an interview centre, be questioned for at least 10 minutes and be fingerprinted and photographed before being allowed to get out of Britain, then surely those seeking to enter our country must&#151;not may&#151;provide this basic information.

<a name="60116-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>This is not being demanded from the outset. Can the Minister also explain how it will operate in the EU context? Three EU nations&#151;Denmark, Latvia and Ireland&#151;do not have ID cards. Is the Minister saying that Mrs Adams of Wolverhampton will, from next year, under government proposals, have to buy an ID card as a tax on leaving Britain if she wants to visit her daughter in Canada, but that Mrs Adams from Dublin will not be subject to the regime at all if she wants to visit London? I do not quite understand this logic. What exactly will be expected of overseas visitors, and EU visitors in particular, in what circumstances and when? I beg to move.

<a name="60116-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Selsdon: </b>   My Lords, I have a lot of sympathy with my noble friend but do not totally agree with her amendment. She is right, because she has raised an important issue in that nobody should be entitled to <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 493</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

enter without proof of identity. We are aware of the number of people who have slipped through that net over the years. It is a matter of considerable concern. The question is therefore how that proof of identity, entitling a foreign resident or foreigner to enter the United Kingdom, can be converted into some form of data that may be retained on the national register. With that, depending on the length of stay which he has in the United Kingdom, might have normally gone the requirement that he should carry his national piece of identity, whatever that may be, with him at all times.
</p>

<a name="60116-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>Within the EEA, almost all biometric cards that go with a passport will be relatively standardised. However, in other countries, the pieces of identification that I have had to look at when people have asked to open a bank account or withdraw funds run to something that was perhaps run under a hosepipe for month or sat under a camel. Proof of identity usually never has a number that we could relate to it. If we are seeking to collect the numbers of a piece of identification, we should surely have within that the place of origin and the date of issue. Surely, above all, it should have that proof of identity that was issued to an entrant upon the moment he entered the United Kingdom.

<a name="60116-22_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, I can see the point of this. We have got a rather anomalous situation that mirrors that which I believe existed on the Continent in the mid-19th century. France and everywhere had ID cards and controlled the movements of their citizens extremely rigorously. The only people allowed to travel freely, who could get on with life and trade and other things, were the mad English, who did not have any form of identity, not even a passport. The Continent had to accept that they could have freedom of movement, so they lived a much more privileged existence. That would be completely the wrong way round to treat our citizens and would cause a lot of trouble, so we need to get this right.

</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I start by expressing my thanks to all noble Lords who have put down their names to speak in this short debate. I know that in the world outside Parliament, the efforts of those who speak up for the railways are always appreciated.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>Britain&#039;s railway is now the fastest growing in Europe. In the past 10 years passenger numbers have grown by 40 per cent, which is faster than in any other European railway. The numbers have outstripped those carried by the SNCF in France, and are exceeded only by German railways. Numbers are now higher in Britain than at any time since the late 1950s. Freight-tonne miles have also increased by more than 50 per cent since 1994. I expect that my noble friend Lord Berkeley may have more to say about that in a moment.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>The growth in passenger numbers has taken place across the board&#151;in long distance journeys which, in British Rail days, we used to call InterCity, in London and the south-east, and in regional services, including virtually all those that used to appear with depressing regularity on potential closure lists&#151;particularly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_495"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 495</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those that have benefited from association with the community rail partnership. Thank goodness that the railway has now stopped planning how to make itself smaller, and is instead planning for growth.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>There are three reasons for that. The first is economic growth. Demand for rail travel rises with GDP. A strong economy is good for the railway, and the railway is good for the economy. Secondly, the railways have improved their marketing and passenger appeal. New and more frequent trains are popular, and the railways are rather better at telling the public about them.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>The third factor is a negative one. It is people&#039;s realisation that travelling by car is not as much fun as it used to be. Private motorists find themselves caught up in traffic jams, and when they get to their destination, they find the streets clogged with traffic, parking spaces hard to find and, for most people, it is increasingly expensive.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>Governments of both parties in the past failed to realise the potential of our railways to offer solutions to those problems. Instead they believed that they could deal with them by building more and more miles of motorway&#151;the classic predict and provide approach.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The success of the congestion charge in London is prompting us to look closely at a national system of road-user charging. That cannot come a moment too soon, and already those trends have encouraged rail growth and the switch from car usage. In the past 10 years, train mileage has increased by 20 per cent, and the number of trains run has gone up by 12 per cent to a total of almost 20,000 passenger trains run each day. The network is larger, with 148 miles of new or reopened lines for passenger services in the past 10 years, with 51 new or reopened stations.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>That programme of expansion and reopening needs to continue. It is doing so in Scotland and Wales with their devolved administrations thoroughly committed to their countries&#039; railways. In Wales, for example, the Vale of Glamorgan line has already been reopened, and provides a link with Cardiff International Airport. The reopening of the line to Ebbw Vale is planned for next year as part of the regeneration of that former steel town.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>The Scottish Executive has made railways a priority in transport and economic development terms, with many major new rail schemes being implemented or planned. Committed investment includes longer trains for Edinburgh suburban services, and a strategic freight scheme to provide a direct route for coal to Longannet power station, which releases capacity on the Edinburgh-Glasgow line and on the Forth Bridge. That scheme also restores a passenger service to Alloa, which I am sure will be a matter of great satisfaction to the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie. Until now, Alloa was the largest town in Scotland not served by rail. Other big schemes planned include rail links for Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, redevelopment of Waverley station and the reopening of the Borders line from Edinburgh to Tweedbank, though sadly not yet as far as Carlisle.

</p>

<a name="60116-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>In both Wales and Scotland there is a clear strategy of enhancements and reopenings, sponsored by their devolved administrations. Sadly, so far there is nothing comparable on the horizon for England, although I hope that my noble friend will be a little more positive than perhaps I can be at the moment.

</p>

<a name="60116-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>Train operators have done well in getting more out of their resources. GNER, for example, runs 22 per cent more services on the east coast main line with the same fleet with which it started in 1996. On other lines, many services have doubled in frequency&#151;for example, between London and Derby and Nottingham; between London and Norwich; and between London and Cardiff. But the system cannot take much more growth. Most of the spare capacity that existed 10 years ago has been used up, with the result that punctuality and reliability performance is more difficult to maintain as it is that much harder to recover from any service disruption.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>All the same, performance has steadily improved since the low point of 2001, and the latest public performance measure for the second quarter of last year reached 87 per cent, which was four percentage points higher than in the same period the previous year. The number of complaints has dropped, and the national passenger survey shows satisfaction levels up to 77 per cent. It is not ideal, but it is a great improvement on where they were.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The rail industry has adapted and accommodated much of the growth with limited investment in increased infrastructure. That has used up most of the available spare capacity, and further growth would result in a deteriorating performance unless there were some investment in increased capacity. There are many examples of routes where capacities could be enhanced by some fairly modest infrastructural investment. Take, for example, the Cotswold line, which runs from Oxford to Worcester and on to Hereford. Earlier short-sighted decisions led to much of the route being reduced to single track. That affects reliability and makes it impossible to run the hourly service that the growth in passenger demand justifies. So, some redoubling of the track is essential, as it is on routes such as Salisbury to Exeter.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>The Government have provided significant funds to support the railway. Indeed, the sum is substantially more than used to be provided to British Rail, both in terms of franchise support payments and in Network Rail grant. Franchise payments are coming down, and the most recent franchise awards have required premium payments from TOCs to the Government. It is important that this income is reinvested in the railway to accommodate the expected growth.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>Looking ahead, investment in completely new infrastructure is necessary. Crossrail is a vital project, and I hope that we shall have the opportunity to pass the necessary legislation in this House soon. A new high-speed rail route is needed to link the north and south of the country. It has the potential to reduce travel times between London and Scotland to three hours&#151;the length of journey that Department for Transport studies show gives rail the edge over air. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_497"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 497</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Given that more than 93 per cent of the business travel market between England and Scotland is by air&#151;I suspect a similar number as a proportion of your Lordships make that journey regularly&#151;a new north-south high-speed rail link would make a huge difference if journey times can be significantly less than four hours.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>The rail freight business would also benefit as a dedicated high-speed passenger route would create space for freight on current tracks and allow it to expand further. Some good work has already been done on the new north-south line, particularly by the Institution of Civil Engineers and by Sir Rod Eddington and the so-called blue sky thinkers in No. 10. Perhaps my noble friend can show the House some of that unit&#039;s current thinking on the project.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>It is not as if we are incapable of building new high-speed rail links in this country. The Channel Tunnel rail link demonstrates that we can. It is the first purpose-built high-speed line in the UK, and will be completed on time and within its &#163;5.2 million project budget.
</p>

<a name="60116-22_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>Increasing the number of passengers travelling by train is advantageous for all sorts of reasons. It will, for example, help to reduce UK air carbon emissions as rail is the most environmentally sustainable transport network to link the major cities. No longer can we be planning for the decline, as railways were forced to do through the 1970s, 1980s and the 1990s. As a nation we should be proud of our railways, and of the men and women who work on them. With the Government&#039;s support and the support of everyone in public office, they will have a great future.

<a name="60116-23_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   My Lords, the House should be very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, for giving us the opportunity to discuss expanding the rail network and services on it, in the face of ever-increasing demand for rail services.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>For these Benches, the railway is not just a desirable and green form of surface transport; it is also a congestion buster for the road network and a less polluting alternative to domestic air travel. There is no doubt that demand for road travel is ever-increasing and it may be the only way of making a journey, but where there is a rail alternative, that service should be expected to perform at the highest level to abstract vehicles from the road network for the benefit of travellers and to reduce road congestion. For domestic air travel, the rail network&#039;s contribution is more strategic. Clearly, air travel does not clog up the roads, except in the vicinity of airports. Domestic air travel must be reduced for air pollution and fuel consumption reasons. For rail-for-air substitution to be successful, journey times by rail must be reduced. Fortunately, we already know how to engineer this reduction in journey time: CTRL and the French TGV are easy examples. Of course, there will have to be a very strategic determination to do this, to find the money and to deliver the high-speed lines.

</p>

<a name="60116-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>So how are the transport Ministers doing? My impression is that transport Ministers in England&#151;the biggest market&#151;are not achieving much expansion of the network and the services upon it. Perhaps the Minister will correct my view in his reply. However, it is inevitably to Scotland that I turn for the remaining seconds of this short debate.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I acknowledge that last year significant powers over the rail network in Scotland were devolved to the   Scottish Ministers. I also acknowledge that the devolution settlement has led to generous overprovision of funding for the Scottish Parliament. This is no time to discuss that latter issue, but at least we can ask whether the money is being well spent. My view is that the Scottish Executive and all the opposition parties in Scotland have a sound view that the rail network should be enhanced and expanded. New trains have been bought and many rail projects, including tram schemes, are now under way. Railway extensions to Larkhall and Kelvindale have been completed. Below my home, as I mentioned previously, the Stirling, Alloa and Kincardine railway is being actively rebuilt, and I have the mud all over my vehicles to prove it. The Scottish Parliament has before it Bills for railways into the Scottish Borders to Tweedmouth; between Bathgate and Drumgelloch, which will reinstate a fifth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow; rail links to the airports at Edinburgh and Glasgow; and two separate tram schemes in Edinburgh. There is also a chord being built to allow trains to run between the two remaining Glasgow termini, and commuter services into Aberdeen and Inverness are being developed.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>All this is very promising. However, I hope that consideration can be given to these further points: please deliver more car parking and a GB network card for off-peak travel; please electrify the Edinburgh to Glasgow line through Falkirk High; please&#151;and this is a Great Britain plea&#151;create classes of trains that will deliver better long-distance trains in Scotland. The class 170 Turbostars are really only outer-suburban stock. Please also design a class of tourist train with big windows and substantial luggage space for the many British scenic lines used by holidaymakers. The class 156s currently employed are also only outer-suburban stock. I wish the railways well.

<a name="60116-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rosser: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester for having secured this brief but important debate. As he said, Britain has Europe&#039;s fastest-growing railway: passenger kilometres and passenger journeys have increased by some 40 per cent over the past decade. An average of 3 million passenger journeys are made on Britain&#039;s rail network every day, which is the highest number in 50 years, yet on a network that is some 40 per cent smaller. Rail freight has also grown by nearly 50 per cent over the past 10 years. There has been spare capacity to cope with some, but only some, of this increase in rail traffic. Increased investment has also been needed to enable the industry to take the additional traffic it now carries. I am sure that when my <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_499"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 499</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

noble friend responds to the debate, he will quite rightly refer to the considerable levels of investment that have been, are being, and are to be made in our rail network.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>However the question is not whether, but to what extent, after some 10 years of growth, we have already reached, or are very close to reaching, maximum capacity on certain heavily used parts of the network and the extent to which this issue will be addressed by planned levels of investment and when. If the population of this country and the demand for rail continue to grow, including in London and the south-east where most, but not all of the railway capacity bottlenecks exist, then, at the very least, these capacity bottlenecks will have to be removed. While that can be done in a variety of ways, surely we have now reached the stage where new routes and more tracks on existing routes will be needed to a much greater extent to provide the capacity to meet existing and future demand. While the July 2004 transport White Paper stated that capacity on the London Underground will be increased by 12 per cent by 2012, it gave no figures for increases planned in the capacity of the national rail network overall or in key parts where there are already capacity constraints. Yet government policy, as set out in the July 2004 White Paper, is that the trend of rising numbers of passengers should continue and accelerate. We must address capacity issues before they start to have an appreciable adverse impact on the network and the ability to provide the level and quality of service required.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>We also need to ensure that the social and environmental returns from investing in rail, not solely the financial returns, are taken into account in determining levels of investment in the railways and between the different forms of transport. This is a point that the Eddington transport study needs to take on board. I hope that the Department for Transport will also ensure that there is an appropriate and transparent balance between resources invested to create additional capacity to meet existing and projected demand and resources invested primarily to maintain the existing system. I trust that when my noble friend responds he will be able to make it clear that the Government very much have their eye on the ball and on the need to ensure that the required investment is made to provide the physical capacity in the rail network to meet existing and projected demand. The alternative is more delays and more crowded trains, with freight and passenger traffic having to be discouraged through increasing fares and charges to match the demand to the capacity available.

<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="60116-23_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Greengross: </b>   My Lords, much of the increased demand for rail travel, which has been so eloquently described by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, and other noble Lords has, we know, led to a huge problem of overcrowding. We know that, in reality, only three things can be done to reduce it: first, we can do nothing and hope it all goes away; secondly, we can adopt the old British Rail approach and raise <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_500"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 500</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

fares until demand matches supply; and the final and, I suggest, only acceptable way is to provide more capacity.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>However, more capacity means longer trains or more of them and, unfortunately, longer trains require longer platforms, which, in turn, often means repositioning signalling and, sometimes, the track itself. It is bad enough along the route, but at the London termini the sums of money and the planning processes involved are daunting. The other way we know to increase capacity is to run more trains, but, unfortunately, on our most crowded routes the infrastructure no longer safely allows us to put on any more trains. More trains would require a complete additional infrastructure and while that is a better solution in the longer term, it is even more costly. Anything less may be a short-term palliative measure, but no more. We know that we would merely put back a real solution for a few years and make the eventual solution even more difficult and costly. A proper solution will require great courage, a huge commitment and vast sums of money. Many would say that time is not nearly running out but has already done so.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>This debate gives the Government a perfect opportunity to commit themselves to taking real action. They can, at least, tell us what they are going to do and stick to it even when the Treasury provides its traditional mauling. Anything else is little short of a confidence trick, being played out on those millions of people who suffer appalling conditions because successive governments have refused to face the facts.

<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="60116-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Greaves: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester on getting this valuable short debate. I admired the optimistic view of the railways that he put forward, yet I cannot entirely share it&#151;certainly not in England, where we seem to lack a Government with the purpose and commitment to railways that Scotland, as my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie set out, is fortunate to have.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>In the short time that I have, I was going to talk about the need for a north-south high-speed link, but there I merely want to endorse with enthusiasm the words of the noble Lord, Lord Worcester, and of my noble friend. That idea has been around for quite a few years; its time has now come, and it really requires commitment from national Government to get it under way. That is a long-term or at least medium-term project; but, if yet another high-speed rail line can be built from Calais to Paris, as is now proposed to shorten journey times on the Channel Tunnel rail-link routes, then surely we can look to build a new line from London to the north of England&#151;and, further, to Scotland.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>Meanwhile we have the two main lines. The west coast main line has had a substantial upgrade. That was a difficult project for all sorts of reasons, but its value now shows. Then we have the east coast main line, which has for a long time been this country&#039;s premier inter-city route. I suggest that unless a great <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_501"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 501</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

deal of investment takes place now in the east coast main line, on a fairly short-term basis&#151;longish short-term, if you like&#151;then we shall be in difficulties. That east coast main line is visibly close to capacity; companies such as Hull Trains are trying to get new paths which are proving difficult to find.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>Improvements are happening. Yet they consist of,    for example, the substantial and welcome improvements to Leeds station, suggestions of remodelling Peterborough, and the diversionary freight improvements put in place south of Doncaster. Those are all welcome, but they are only palliative measures&#151;and, as we know, particularly in the sections north of Peterborough and Grantham the main line electrification was done, to a degree, on the cheap. It requires really substantial investment to bring it up to scratch. Not even that commitment exists in the way which I suggest that it should.
</p>

<a name="60116-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>Finally, we have the threat in the north of England not of expanding services but of cuts in them. That will follow the review of the northern franchise, and we are perhaps awaiting the imminent result of that with bated breath. I live at the end of a branch line between Preston and Colne. The last 10 miles of that, as far as Colne, is a siding from the Gannow Junction at Burnley. There is a real sense that such lines are in danger of being chopped off; yet just over the Pennines we have the tremendous success of electrification and the new Class 333 trains on the Leeds-Bradford northern triangle routes to Skipton and Ilkley. Those are excellent trains and services, resulting in increased patronage, yet even there we are told that cuts are possible because of the cost of leasing the new trains. That is madness. Will the Minister not agree that we should be going for expansion of the railways?

<a name="60116-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Snape: </b>   My Lords, I join in the general congratulations to my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester on giving us the opportunity to participate in this evening&#039;s short debate about the railway industry. I declare an interest as an employee of the National Express group, one of Britain&#039;s major train operators. In the four minutes open to me, I wish to make five quick points. Whether I succeed remains to be seen.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>First, I will ask my noble friend on the Front Bench about the railway infrastructure throughout England. Enough mention has been made of Scotland and Wales and, while I congratulate the devolved institutions for their work there, it shows up the gap between what is happening in England and activity north or west of our border. We are experiencing an annual growth rate of about 4 per cent in carrying railway passengers. In any other business, people would be planning years ahead to ensure that they could cater for that growth, but we are not good at doing that. Long-term planning is a phrase that makes the Treasury quake in its boots, regardless of the political hue of the government of the day. All too often, short-termism rules OK.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_502"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 502</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>Mention has been made of Sir Rod Eddington&#039;s north-south high-speed rail line, should he recommend such a project. Again, at the prospect of paying out the billions of pounds that that will take, one can just imagine the sucking in of breath at the Treasury. Yet the alternative is increasing congestion on our road network and increasing problems within our rail industry. My noble friend mentioned Salisbury and Exeter. I understand that in the short term, there is no business case for doubling capacity on the Salisbury to Exeter line. Well, why do we not look at the long term for once? The case will certainly exist then, and will cost more each year that we postpone it. I fear that is the inevitable fate over many years of railway projects.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Secondly, I want to ask my noble friend about franchising policy. As someone who works for the National Express group, I hate to sound like a bad loser, but why was First Great Western awarded the new franchise? First Great Western is at the bottom of the league tables of inter-city punctuality and reliability. Its new franchise takes part of Wessex Trains, formerly run by the National Express group&#151;which, in the same league table, was at the top. Now, I am unsure why National Express should lose Wessex Trains to what is presently the worst performing inter-city TOC. Can the Minister tell us? I fear that it is because of the &#163;2 billion premium that First Great Western offered for that franchise. I note, as I hope the Minister has done, that the bulk of that payment is at the back end of the franchise. The great fear is that if fares are allowed to go up but insufficient profit is made to make those substantial payments, First will then say: &quot;Thanks very much; we tried our best but didn&#039;t have much success with it&quot;. The advantages that we have seen of a sensible franchising policy will be thrown away.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Thirdly, some congratulations are in order for Network Rail. Given the awful experiences with Railtrack, Network Rail has done a fine job by bringing much of its maintenance in-house&#151;the only sensible way to go about maintaining the railway. I wish that it would shout a bit more loudly or strongly about its successes.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>Fourthly, I must tell my noble friend that there is something wrong with the leasing policy on new trains. I am not saying that he is in any way responsible; the last Conservative government were. But there is something wrong somewhere when decent trains are lying rotting in army sidings at Bicester and Long Marston, and people are travelling between Sheffield and Doncaster in Class 142 pacers&#151;those are, supposedly, express trains. The Government really ought to look again at that.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Finally, on fares policy; if, as it appears, fares are to go up with such great regularity as appears to be the case, especially to repay some franchise payments, then much of the good work of the railway&#151;and the good publicity that it deserves&#151;will not happen. Again, we ought to look at fares policy and ensure that it attracts people out of aeroplanes and motor cars, and on to our trains.

I am myself a devotee of the trains system; I use it as much as possible. Whenever I have to go to the Continent, I go by Eurotunnel or Eurostar; whenever I have to go to Ireland, which is quite often, I go by rail and ferry in the old way that I used to, during and immediately after the war.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>Not only do I welcome it but the Green Party is thoroughly behind the idea that we should use the railways more effectively. We objected to rail privatisation and the fragmentation of the industry. We said:


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;It will lead to higher fares, line closures, less frequent services, reduced safety, the loss of through ticketing, rail cards and other network benefits.

<a name="60116-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>The Green Party was not the only party to object: Labour also objected to privatisation. In 1996, it said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;The Labour Party is deeply opposed to rail privatisation, as is the British public. It is clear to all serious analysts that [Conservative] government policy is driven by an ideological commitment to privatisation at any price, rather than a proper consideration of the national interest and the country&#039;s long-term transport needs. Labour is committed to a publicly owned and publicly accountable railway&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>That was Labour in opposition. But Labour in government has, as we know, pursued a very different policy.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>A privatised railway achieves the worst of both possible worlds. It is neither accountable to the public as a public rail service should be, nor is it delivering better standards or reduced costs as privatised services are supposed to in theory.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>In 2001, I brought to this House a short Bill to renationalise Railtrack. In the debate, I challenged the Government to take up the Green Party&#039;s Bill. In replying for the Government, the Transport Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, refused and said that the Government had improved the regulation of the railways and that the structure of the railway industry needed evolution not revolution. How wrong can you be? Just six months later, Railtrack effectively went bust. It was taken back into a form of public ownership and is now known as Network Rail.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>Then what did we have? We had another review. That produced the <i>Future of Rail</i> White Paper<i> </i>in July 2004, which led to the Railways Act 2005. Rather than biting the bullet and properly re-integrating the railways, it merely tinkers with the structure and, in some respects, makes it worse. The SRA was abolished and most of its responsibilities were shared out between the Department for Transport and Network Rail. This is bad news because it effectively puts the Treasury, via the DfT, in charge of the railways. Everyone&#151;right or left&#151;agrees that the Treasury, an organisation which has had a malign influence on the railways for many decades, should be kept as far away from the railways as possible.

<a name="60116-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group. I congratulate my noble friend on introducing the debate this evening but I should like to introduce a note of caution into the discussions about high-speed lines, Maglev or jet propulsion between London and Scotland.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>As other noble Lords have said, the demand for freight services will go up by something like 30 per cent in 10 years and probably double in 15 to 20 years. It has gone up by 60 per cent since privatisation. Similarly, passenger demand has gone up and clearly there is not enough capacity on the east coast or west coast main lines to take this traffic. So we need to look at a few options to meet the demand.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>First, we must remember that the new signalling system, the ERTMS, will one day provide a significant increase in capacity. We do not know when, we do not know how much, but we must not forget that because it will use existing lines. Another way would be to use the existing lines but separate higher speed passenger trains from freight and slower passenger services on some parts of the routes, by building extra tracks, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, and, in addition, by creating a possible new route for freight using existing but lightly used lines. This could be achieved by wiggling up the middle of England and ending up in Carlisle. This would, of course, be much cheaper than building a new TGV line. It would leave the main lines with less freight on them to be improved to allow trains to go a bit faster and possibly to achieve extra capacity and a three-hour journey to Edinburgh from London, which my noble friend suggested was desirable.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>What really worries me is the cost. The costs of the Channel Tunnel rail link will probably end up nearer &#163;6 billion than &#163;5 billion. That means that a new TGV line to Edinburgh from London would cost about &#163;30 billion using tried and tested technology. I do not think one can estimate what Maglev or jet engines would cost. The thought of a jet-engine train going into Euston or Waverley stations does not really appeal to me. But we need to compare this &#163;30 billion with the &#163;4.6 billion that the Government are spending each year on UK railway passenger services and Network Rail. The Government are saying that that is much too much.
</p>

<a name="60116-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>Ministers need to look at all options. Creating extra capacity for freight on the existing lines and maybe by a new route up the middle using under-used lines, coupled with upgrading the existing east coast main <br>&nbsp;<br>

line and a little more of the west coast main line to take more and faster trains&#151;with more flyovers and a few diversions for the winding bits&#151;and the completion of ERTMS, would be much cheaper and could be phased in over a number of years. I caution Ministers, politicians and the media about getting completely hung-up on a new TGV line to beat the French at their own game. We are a different type of country and, as we saw with the CTRL, wiggling a line through the quite highly populated south-east, the Midlands and the north-east could be quite a challenge. I hope my noble friend will be able to give me some comfort that all these different options will be looked at when the time comes to consider if and how this big demand for extra freight and passenger travel will be met.

<a name="60116-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, I should declare an interest as a member of the Great Western stakeholder board.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>One thing has not changed. I go back to when the east coast main line was electrified and I was working for British Rail. We worked out how many trains we needed to operate the service and the Treasury cut the number by 10 and told us to put the fares up instead, so that we would end up with the revenue that it wanted with much less expenditure to gain that revenue. We have paid for that decision ever since.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>The specification of the railway timetable is now in the hands of a negative and unskilled Civil Service and is closely applied through the franchise specification process. Franchisees do what they are told; they do what civil servants tell them. Offers by franchisees of better services are turned down in favour of the most favourable financial bid with the highest possible fare profile. My question for the Minister is about whether any account is taken of the effect on the roads of such policies. Do we just assume that all the traffic goes by road at no cost at all&#151;no cost in congestion and no cost to anybody&#151;and that we should not have it on the railway because that will cost us some money? Freight, which is not really the subject of the debate, is now considered to be an irrelevant inconvenience. That is why it is left out of planning for&#151;I will give two examples&#151;Crossrail and our ports policy, if we have a real ports policy.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>Network Rail has an extremely weak governance structure, which means that Whitehall can play around with the railway almost as much as it wishes. The incentive for Network Rail is to deliver on delay minutes. You construct the timetable so that trains are more likely to arrive on time. You build gaps and extra recovery time into the timetable and you waste capacity so that the delay minutes target is hit and Network Rail directors get their bonus, while the passenger suffers&#151;the passenger and, in the end, the taxpayer pay.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>There are very weak incentives for Network Rail to carry any more passengers, particularly at weekends, when it seems to occupy the railway with engineering work. I would never have got away with that as a railway manager. Nowadays, the railway seems to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_506"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 506</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

almost closed for business at the weekend, despite the fact that weekends are becoming the time when more people want to travel.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>I have a few questions to finish with. Will the Minister direct his attention to the length of franchises? It is quite apparent that, because Chiltern Railways has a 20-year franchise, it is expanding Marylebone station, it has built a new depot at Wembley and it is investing a lot of its money&#151;not the taxpayer&#039;s money&#151;in the railway. Why do we insist on letting other franchises for so little time so that people cannot get their money back? We should review the rule that was set down under the previous government that, where three units of rolling stock were scrapped, only two new ones were provided. That means that there are very small trains running round a lot of our lines that need extra carriages.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>Is car parking sufficient? We are told that&#151;I believe that these figures are right&#151;in the Great Western franchise there are to be 1,700 new car parking spaces. If you divide that up among the principal stations, that gives perhaps 100 or 150 more car parking spaces each. Will that be enough for the next 10 years? Will they survive what the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, described as congestion charging, when more people will want to come to the railway? There are very cheap ways of expanding car parking. I advise the Minister to go to Beaconsfield to see what Chiltern Railways has done&#151;it has doubled the space of the car park by a simple Lego-style device that adds an extra storey.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>Lastly, is the network really safe in Labour&#039;s hands or are we still going to see what I am sure many in the Treasury desire, which is the demise of the social railway?

<a name="60116-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, I welcome this opportunity to comment from these Benches on an issue that has significant implications for many millions of individuals every day of the year. I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, for initiating the debate.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>I am a fairly recent convert to rail travel. Having for most of my youth jumped in a car and driven to most places, I now value and want to use the railway most of the time. Unfortunately, however, I live in the south-east. Most commentators today have talked about the lack of provision to deal with the problems in England, particularly the south-east of England. The station that I use most regularly for coming here and going to other places is Chelmsford, which I think is the busiest commuter station in the country. Certainly, before seven o&#039;clock in the morning, the platform is something like five deep with people who want to commute into London. Considerable investment needs to be made into the rail network in England, and a great deal of thought should go into what is going on.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>In 2000, the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s 10-year transport plan said that there would be,

</p>

<a name="60116-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Derek Twigg, said in May last year:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;The Government are working with the railway industry to deliver improvements to capacity and performance, which, along with a better deployment of rolling stock and improvements to operating practices and timetables, will improve performance and help alleviate overcrowding&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 24/5/05; col. 540.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>The Secretary of State, Alistair Darling, said in October last year:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;The way to reduce overcrowding on trains&#151;whether it be in the south-east or anywhere else&#151;is to increase the number of passengers that can be carried on them. That is part of the work that Sir Rod Eddington is doing for us at the moment . . . What is important is that we sign up to the proposition of a growing railway, which is so important to the economy of the south-east as well as to the country as a whole&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> Commons, 11/10/05; col. 142.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will not simply repeat those words but will give us some real facts about what might happen to improve the railways. We need to know what is actually going to happen. There is increased congestion and lack of capacity; there has been a double whammy, with fares increased by more than the rate of inflation. We heard today that in 1997 government investment was about &#163;1 billion, and that in 2003-04 it was about &#163;3.5 billion. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said that the investment figure was about &#163;4.5 billion per year now. But what do we see for that? Despite all that investment, the public performance measure, introduced in 2000 to give a better indication of Britain&#039;s passenger railways, is still below what it was in 1998.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>The problem of capacity has become so acute that we are hearing that the Secretary of State for Transport will give the go-ahead to close lines and reduce the existing timetables, supposedly to improve the services that remain. An article in tonight&#039;s <i>Evening Standard</i> suggested closing rural lines to invest in the south-east. Surely that is not the idea. We really need to tackle this problem.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>Before I finish&#151;and this has been a very timely debate&#151;I should like to mention two issues which are close to my heart and which I have mentioned before. The first is the potential expansion of Stansted airport. I have already mentioned the problems of the south-east. I hope the noble Lord will recognise, as he has done before, that we cannot expand Stansted to take 70 million passengers without having a tremendously improved rail service to it&#151;otherwise it will just become the largest car park in the world, with all the problems that that means.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>Crossrail, which we shall be debating shortly, has been mentioned by several noble Lords today. We all support it, but where is the money coming from, how will it happen, and what will happen during its construction? I have already mentioned the capacity problems of the south-east. The construction of Crossrail could bring the whole of the south-east to a halt.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>This has been a very worthwhile debate, and I hope that the noble Lord can give us some real answers, not just fine words.

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="60116-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, if I manage fine words, they will be spoken in rather breathless haste. To have 10 speakers in a debate and give a response to them in an hour is rather demanding. Noble Lords will forgive me if I appear somewhat breathless in my approach to these issues.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>After a number of difficult years, Britain&#039;s railways are today a success story. That is the basis on which my noble friend Lord Faulkner introduced this debate. I congratulate him on his speech, in which he asked me some challenging questions but also paid tribute to the enormous development of the railway over the past decade.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, regretted that we had not restored our railways to a nationalised framework, but we have a level of investment which could not have been dreamt of a decade or so ago and a degree of control over that investment which augurs well for the future development of the railways. The noble Lord gave the historical perspective; he noticeably left out Hatfield, which is one of the biggest events of the past decade in terms of railway performance. The railways have acquired the stupendous degree of investment necessary to guarantee the most important issue of all, that of safety. I hope that he recognises the achievements in that area too.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>Noble Lords raised a range of interesting questions. My noble friend Lord Faulkner, with his deep interest in the railways, raised a number of issues which I will attempt to respond to, many of which were replicated in the debate by other contributions. He mentioned the high-speed rail link to Scotland. I heard my noble friend Lord Berkeley pour some cold water on this; he is right that the costs for the project are very significant indeed, but so are the potential rewards. My noble friend Lord Faulkner referred to the railways competing with the airways. They ought to, on environmental grounds if no other, and for the convenience of passengers&#151;93 per cent of the traffic from England to Scotland, and vice versa, is by air. If the railways are to compete, we have to think afresh about how we do it.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>I respect my noble friend Lord Berkeley&#039;s anxieties. The invested costs are such that they might lead to less investment in other areas. That issue has got to be considered, but let us have no doubt that if we are to go ahead with such a project we need to plan and consider these issues fully now. That is exactly what we are doing. We made a commitment before the last general election in our manifesto that this would be an issue that we would consider thoroughly. That work is going on apace, with the possibility of an announcement in due course.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, emphasised the Scottish dimension with regard to rail. I recognise the Scottish expansion. Several of my colleagues from England&#151;including, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Snape&#151;indicated that Scotland had had additional investment not altogether matched in England. My <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_509"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 509</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

noble friend Lord Rosser also commented on that fact. We very much approve and applaud the success of Scottish investment.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>I take on board the point raised about car parking. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, at the end of his contribution emphasised that without car parking we cannot solve a great deal of the potential expansion in demand for the railway. That is right. There is no way in which we can take into account investment in rail and approach the issue of the capacity of rail unless we look at the capacity of people&#039;s access to stations, which means being able to park cars there. That is an integral part of our thinking about development. It is easier in some areas than others, as noble Lords will recognise, but I emphasise that the Government are fully alert to and aware of this feature of railway expansion.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>My noble friend Lord Rosser commented on the issues with his great experience and long professional life serving the railways. He is right that some of the major capacity bottlenecks are inevitably in the south-east. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made the point in his contribution as well. We all recognise the particular demands, particularly of commuter services, in the south-east and the great demands on rolling stock. I think that noble Lords will recognise the significant investment that has gone on in recent years, including investment in rolling stock. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Snape, said about some rolling stock still in sidings, but he will recognise that as a reflection of investment there has been an enormous reduction in the overall age in the rolling stock, particularly for commuter services, in recent years. A great deal of this has been concentrated in essential areas in the south-east.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, from her perspective emphasised the importance of the railways. I know that in her wider interests in life she is concerned about the railways being an important service for those who do not drive cars. A great number of people who are too elderly or infirm to drive cars gain advantage from railway travel. If the railway provides a service, it has to do so at the right level of convenience for that population. I accept the points that she made, but I hope she will recognise what my noble friend Lord Faulkner emphasised in his opening speech&#151;that we have seen an expansion in investment and a growth in the railways in recent years. We are committed to that and intend to make further additions as the years go by.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>I am conscious of the fact that part of the debate concentrated very much on the short term. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, commented on the advancement of the west coast main line. We could not&#151;in fact, we did not&#151;have a railway debate for the past six or seven years without the west coast main line featuring prominently, with constant criticism from all parts of the House, because of the difficulties that were experienced during its refurbishment. Happily, that time has passed. That significant investment is producing considerable rewards and increased use of the railway. I am all too well aware of the fact that we now need to extend some of that development to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_510"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 510</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

services which are not as strategic as the west coast main line. I take on board the points which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, made about certain aspects of inter-city travel and inter-town travel in the north of England. Cross-country rolling stock is not up to standard there. We know the importance of investment in that area.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, was critical of certain aspects of the way in which Network Rail and the train companies go about their jobs. He said that there may be an over-emphasis on aspects of punctuality. Given the record of the railway during those years of excessive decline, it is difficult to think of a greater priority that people set for the railway than the expectation that their train is going to arrive on time. I know what he meant when he said that we may reduce capacity by having adequate margins for punctuality. Our high-level specification strategy will look at how we can enhance capacity. Through our present rail utilisation strategies, we are looking in great detail&#151;in the medium term as well as the short term&#151;at line utilisation in order that we get the maximum out of the system that we have.
</p>

<a name="60116-25_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>I take on board elements of his criticism, but there is one point with which I have great difficult. He knows that I never feel terribly warm towards the issue of the length of the railway franchises. The noble Lord brought up the 20-year Chiltern franchise. That franchise is almost unique in its limited interaction with the rest of the rail system. It is easier to produce a rail franchise for a system which is more self-contained than many others. We have shorter franchise times than that. The noble Lord spoke about longer-term investment, but we think that we have received franchise bids which reflect investment.

</p>

<a name="60116-25_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>My noble friend Lord Snape will not draw me into trying to establish for him why a particular potential franchisee lost out in a bid. First, it would be a misuse of parliamentary time to debate this issue with a particular interest. Secondly, although past performance is taken into account when judging to whom to allocate franchises, performance and effectiveness are the crucial criteria. I am afraid that he cannot come to the House as a representative of a bad loser. I will not enter that debate with him.

I made it quite plain that I was not speaking as a bad loser. We are talking about a lot of public money, and Ministers have a responsibility to account for it.

<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="60116-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, large amounts of public money are of course involved, but I will argue the case in relation to general franchises rather than to one particular case for the reasons that I have identified.

<a name="60116-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>I accept the point which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made again; that is, that we cannot expect to see the development of an airport such as Stansted with an inadequate rail link to it. Although that rail service has been enhanced in recent years, it still falls lamentably short of an adequate service for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_511"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 511</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the expansion plans that Stansted has. There is no doubt that he is right that investment in the rail service to Stansted is necessary. I think that he was the only noble Lord to raise the important matter of Crossrail. In his very short and rather breathless contribution he identified the problems that Crossrail threw up. By heavens, Crossrail throws up enormous problems regarding how the engineering works will be carried out. He is also right that it is very costly and we have to get the finance in order, but the benefit to London of having a west-to-east cross-London link will be very significant&#151;in fact, it is one of the great contributions that the railway can make to the benefit of our fellow citizens.

<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="60116-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am not that unfit. The amendment simply adds the single word &quot;external&quot; in Clause 1(7)(e) before the words, &quot;physical characteristics&quot;. The clause would then state that,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;references to an individual&#039;s identity&quot;,</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>The problem as we see it&#151;because other names are added to the amendment&#151;is that Schedule 1 and Clause 43, a definition clause, do not refer to physical characteristics at all. Both refer to &quot;biometric&quot; particulars. The definition in Clause 43 states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;&#039;biometric information&#039;, in relation to an individual, means data about his external characteristics, including, in particular, the features of an iris or any other part of the eye&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>In effect, the definition of &quot;biometric information&quot; in Clause 43 includes that magic word &quot;external&quot; in relation to characteristics that I want to see added in    this subsection for consistency purposes.

<a name="column_512"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 512</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Schedule 1, which has to be within Clause 1, we could improve the Bill by making it abundantly clear that reference in Clause 1 to physical characteristics is to external characteristics only. Otherwise there is a danger that in some future time another government may give a different interpretation&#151;although not this Government, because they have made it clear what they mean with respect to &quot;physical characteristics&quot; in Schedule 1, and I do not for a second doubt that they will stick to that. But I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, as a lawyer, will agree with me that Clause 1(7), when it talks of physical characteristics, is capable in future of being construed as including non-external characteristics; it could include internal physical characteristics. That might be from X-rays or internal body fluids. Although it goes on in Clause 1(7) to say,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>&quot;physical characteristics . . . that are capable of being used for identifying him&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>under laboratory conditions, analysis of internal physical characteristics or body fluids, which are physical characteristics, would render such internal matter capable of being used to identify the individual.
</p>

<a name="60116-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>In drafting the amendment, I wondered whether one might not use the word &quot;visible&quot; physical characteristics. One might have got round the point by talking about &quot;solid physical characteristics&quot;, to avoid the prospect of DNA samples, for example. The Minister made it absolutely clear what the Government thought about that. However, I repeat, this should not be one of those cases in which glosses in debate, made by a Minister on behalf of the Crown, could be taken to affect the interpretation of those particular words when the words are&#151;as I believe they are here&#151;capable of an independent definition and use. That is all a long way round to say that we on these Benches would like this part of the Bill bolted and barred, because the issue is very important, and a lot of energy has been devoted by all of us to ensure that what goes on the national identity register is limited to what we hope and expect to go on.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>The only other thing that I want to say is that the Information Commissioner has been extremely forthright in his report on the Bill about characteristics, about which this could be said to be one. I refer, too, to the letter that the Minister kindly sent round to us all last week, which took up a series of points that were raised in Committee on 12, 14 and 19 December. On the issue that we are discussing under this amendment, which I raised on 12 December in col. 988, the Minister said in her letter:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a>&quot;Physical characteristics that are capable of being used for identification may include for example reference to a person&#039;s having distinctive scars, or a missing hand or leg . . . However, this would only apply to <i>visible</i> physical characteristics which are capable of helping to identify a person, and therefore illnesses and internal physical characteristics would again be excluded. There is also no power in the Bill that could be used to require a person to provide a DNA sample&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>As I have endeavoured to explain, I do not agree with her that interpretation of &quot;physical characteristics&quot; excludes internal physical characteristics. If, and insofar as, there is doubt about this&#151;and I believe that there has to be&#151;it is easily resolved by adding this <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60116-26_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord&#039;s amendment. I agree that this should be uncontentious, because we are all trying to achieve the same thing as the Government. It is just a matter of how the definition is made clear. As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said, at the moment there appears to be no direct cross-reference between Schedule 1 and Clause 1&#151;so do we need belt and braces? As the noble Lord says, the Government have made it clear that it is not their intention that DNA should come within the remit of the Bill. My concern is that in another place, and sometimes here, the debate has become rather hung up on DNA as being a bit of a mantra. We have said that we accept that that is the Government&#039;s stated intention at this stage with regard to DNA.
</p>

<a name="60116-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>There are two issues related to that matter. One could be very cynical&#151;though I will not be&#151;and say that at one stage the Prime Minister said he would not have ID cards, but he has now found he believes it appropriate to have them. At this stage the Government have a very firm intention that there should be no DNA included in the register and believe that the phraseology prevents it, so there is no need for the further linkage that the noble Lord is trying to obtain between Schedule 1 and Clause 1. First, one needs to have that assurance in the Bill, because one does not know how this Government, or any other in the future, may determine what is politic, in the old-fashioned sense of &quot;politic&quot;. Secondly, one does not know what changes will be made with regard to science over the coming years. If there are changes we would need to have full and proper debate before any such matters could come into the Bill, and I am not sure that any major issues such as that could be adequately dealt with by way of discussions on orders.
</p>

<a name="60116-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>None of this Bill is easy to get right from the point of view of drafting, but if we can do something here that makes it clear that it achieves exactly what we all want, I really do not see the harm. I hope the Minister might be able to consider accepting this. I know the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said he considered other words that might be produced. He has made a very helpful suggestion here. If the Minister says that something else would do this better, I would be happy to look at that. But I think something needs to be teased out here.

<a name="60116-27_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Northesk: </b>   My Lords, I apologise, but my noble friend Lady Anelay has provoked a thought in my head about this. There is already deep concern about the use of X-ray scanning in many respects, particularly in that this is &quot;see under the clothes&quot; technology. I beg the Government to think seriously about this amendment and what it could deliver technologically, with untold technology that is not quite there yet but which is coming.

of the points people raise whenever they talk about this Bill, as I said on a previous amendment, is the addresses they have to give from the past. Something else nearly everyone says is, &quot;Are they going to want our DNA?&quot; They find that enormously threatening. It is perhaps something one can argue against, but it is a genuine emotional anxiety people have, partly through not understanding exactly what DNA is, or its potential for them. The Government might do very well to take the advice of this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="60116-27_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, if a DNA sample is properly taken, it is the characteristic that is capable of being used for identifying a person. These days the techniques are such that, whereas DNA analysis started off with the chances being one in 1 million, they are now one in 1 billion. Those statistics were quoted last weekend in relation to the Thai fishermen and the dreadful case that took place in Thailand. They have had great experience in that country in identifying people through the use of DNA as a result of the tsunami, and their techniques are well developed.
</p>

<a name="60116-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>It may be that at some future time it will be thought right that everyone in this country should have their DNA recorded on a central register. We would obviously oppose that, as we oppose the whole concept of identity cards anyway, but if the Government were to seek the power to put DNA on the register, they should have to come to Parliament in order specifically to get primary legislation, after full debate, to that effect. I know that it is not the intention of the Minister to introduce DNA at this time. However, some way must be found which would prevent a future government, or this Government at some future time, introducing DNA on to the register as a result of a misinterpretation of the Government&#039;s intention due to the wording of the subsection.

<a name="60116-27_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I was asking myself why I liked the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. I have concluded that it is because he is good at judging government Ministers on their real intent. I was pleased when he said that he trusted us on this issue. What I like about the debates that we sometimes have in your Lordships&#039; House is that at least the noble Lord starts from that position. That helps us to find our way through some of these complicated and difficult issues.
</p>

<a name="60116-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>Amendment No. 11 would mean that only external physical characteristics that are capable of being used to identify an individual would be registrable facts and could be recorded, therefore, on the register. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, rehearsed that matter. In Committee, my noble friend Lady Scotland explained that it is intended that only external physical characteristics would be recorded on the register. The definition of biometric information under Clause 43(1) was drafted with that in mind and would prevent the recording of DNA, for example. I believe that that is commonly accepted. I understand the arguments about DNA. Although the noble Lord, Lord Thomas <br>&nbsp;<br>

of Gresford, may be predisposed to be more sceptical about our longer-term intention, the introduction of DNA into this form of data collection field would be a very profound step indeed. I have no doubt that such a proposition would have to be very carefully thought through and would be the subject not just of secondary legislation but of primary legislation if, at some point in the future, a future government thought that it was desirable. I think that we are a very long way from that point. Nevertheless, it is right to raise it as part of the wide parameters of a debate about identification.
</p>

<a name="60116-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>I want to make it clear that we appreciate very much the concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, during this debate and earlier debates about internal physical characteristics that may not be biometrics although we are not necessarily convinced that all the characteristics to which the noble Lord referred would be capable of identifying an individual for the purposes of the identity card scheme. That said, as the noble Lord said, the principle underlying the amendment is very much in line with our intentions. Our intentions are the same. We are happy to consult further with parliamentary counsel and both opposition Benches and to return at Third Reading with an appropriate amendment which addresses the issue at the core of the noble Lord&#039;s argument.
</p>

<a name="60116-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, was right that we should accept the political advice that we have been given from opposition Peers on this issue. With that thought in mind, and with the spirit underlying the intention of the amendment, we are happy to try to return at Third Reading with an amendment which satisfies our shared intentions.

<a name="60116-27_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Northesk: </b>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, perhaps he will clarify one point. I inferred from something he said earlier that the Government perceive the Bill to be all about data collection. Can he confirm that he meant what he said?

<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="60116-27_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, it is not just about data collection although that is an important element. An ID cards system rests on the creation of a register, data collected for maintaining that register, keeping it up to date, and so on. It is a more complex issue. The noble Earl knows that. He seeks to encourage me to say things which are not right.

with it. These matters were debated in Committee. At that stage, they were dealt with in amendments moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in the debate on 23 November, as reported at col. 1675, and they received my support. The Minister gave a very full response, for which I am grateful, and she addressed the issue constructively. I have brought back the amendments simply because I noted that the noble Baroness did not quite manage to address one specific issue in her response, and I shall deal with that also. I need to refer to further developments as a result of a   couple of press reports that appeared on 9   December&#151;two weeks after that debate. So the amendments are brought back in that spirit for further clarification. I do not think that I will need to go further either tonight or at Third Reading because I anticipate that the noble Baroness will be able to reassure me on some points&#151;fingers crossed.
</p>

<a name="60116-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>Amendment No. 14A would raise the age of requirement to register for an ID card from 16 to 18. The difficulty is that when the Minister brought forward her arguments for saying that 16 is the starting age at which one should automatically be brought into the registration process, I remained rather uneasy. Any government&#151;this is not a party-political point&#151;seem to have the odd habit of treating people between the ages of 16 and 18 sometimes as adults and sometimes as children. On the previous occasion, it was easy for the noble Baroness to say, &quot;Well, people between the ages of 16 and 18 might be rather annoyed if they did not have this because they like to be able to prove their age&quot;. Unlike someone like me, who does not like to be reminded of my age, they are proud of their age and like to be able to prove it, particularly&#151;I do not refer to the group to which the Minister referred&#151;when they are over 18 so that they can drink in pubs or elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="60116-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>The difficulty is that if children are forced to register their data at 16&#151;in most law they are still children at that age&#151;and they do not consent to the sharing of that data, it is a breach of Article 16 of the UNCRC, which provides children with the rights to a private and family life. Any interference with that would have to be justified in the public interest, and Article 8(2) of the convention covers that. Although the Minister dealt with the practical implications in her response, she did not respond to the argument about the convention, and I wonder whether she can address that.
</p>

<a name="60116-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>I have this matter at the forefront of my mind at the moment because, as we wend our way through this Bill, and the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill in Grand Committee, we are gearing ourselves up for the Violent Crime Reduction Bill, and I am very aware that that Bill treats people between the ages of 16 and 18 rather like children. I am uneasy that the Government are concentrating on the practical realities, which do carry problems, and I need to step back and look at the philosophical problem of the UNCRC. If the Minister could address that point, I should be grateful.
</p>

<a name="60116-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>Amendment No. 16A would prevent the Secretary of State lowering the age at which a person can be entered on the register if the national register of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_517"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 517</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

children has been started or fully established under Section 12 of the Children Act 2004. Amendment No. 16B would prevent the Secretary of State transferring to the ID register any registrable fact about a child under the age of 16 which had been obtained on the basis that it was going to be used for the purposes of the register to be set up under that same Children Act 2004&#151;unless, that is, the parent or guardian of the child had given written permission for the information to be transferred to the ID register.
</p>

<a name="60116-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>Here, we come to the newspaper reports that I noticed on 9 December. Both the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Daily Mail</i> stated that Ruth Kelly, the Secretary of State for Education, had announced that every child will be given an ID card number from 2008&#151;coincidentally, the year that the Government intend to introduce the first stage of what we call &quot;compulsion by stealth&quot; and the noble Baroness calls &quot;voluntary registration&quot; in this Bill. Ruth Kelly said that the &#163;200 million information-sharing register would go ahead, despite the fears that it could be accessed by paedophiles.


</p>

<a name="60116-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>At the same time, the children&#039;s Minister, Beverley Hughes, said&#151;or the paper has her saying&#151;that the database should have,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>&quot;strong safeguards to make sure information stored is minimal, secure and used appropriately&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>Of course, last March, the Labour-dominated Education Select Committee warned that the child index could be abused. The report stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;We have significant reservations about whether this will be the best uses of resources and very significant concerns about critical issues such as security, confidentiality and access arrangements&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>That is my concern too. In her response on 23 November in col. 1681, the Minister reminded the House that the child register and the ID register have two different functions. I agree with her. The child register is intended to allow practitioners to share information about children to improve their well-being. We all agree with that; it is an admirable objective. The problem is that there will be significant amounts of information that should not necessarily be transferred or transferable to the ID register and we need to make it clear in this Bill that that cannot happen.
</p>

<a name="60116-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>My concern is that the child index will go ahead at the same time as the initial period of the ID cards. Until we know that the security of the child index system is robust, there should not be a power for the Secretary of State to transfer information on children from the child index to the ID register unless permission has clearly been given by a parent or a guardian. I beg to move.

It seems to me that it is quite wrong that children of 16&#151;they are children until they are 18 under all kinds of legislation&#151;should be required compulsorily to register, with all the problems and all the possibilities of penalties that that involves. I know <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_518"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 518</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

my noble friend Lady Walmsley was concerned not merely with the age of 16, as it appears in subsection (2)(a), but also in subsection (6), whereby,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State may by order modify the age for the time being specified in subsection (2)(a)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>That means that the Secretary of State, by placing a draft of the order before Parliament and having it approved, could reduce the age down to whatever&#151;10 or even lower. In the end, I suspect we may find that children will be given an identity registration number at birth and will have it branded on their documentation throughout their lives. I think this point has not been thought through by the Government. I wholly support the amendment.

<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="60116-28_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister know whether there have been proper consultations in Scotland about this? I am not in a position to say what the differences are, but there are some differences in the law concerning children. There could possibly be a clash. The Scottish Parliament has said that it is not at all interested in identity cards and does not want to use them in any way at all&#151;a fact which I am sure will eventually disappear into oblivion as time goes on if the Bill becomes law. But it is important to be quite sure that we are all right <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> Scots law concerning children. If the Minister does not know that there has been full consultation, I ask her to ensure that there is, so that there is no clash.

There is a serious issue involved here and I hope that the Government address properly that issue in respect of ID cards.

<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>If one looks first at the UNCRC, the relevant article is almost identical to Article 8 of the ECHR.

</p>

<a name="60116-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>I remind the House that those at the age of 16 are in a position to apply for a passport. We made it clear in Committee that the age of 16 was set for good reason: it is the age at which an adult 10-year passport is issued, and is the school leaving age. In that discussion, the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, suggested that the accepted definition of a child in this country is someone aged under 18. The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, is right that, in various pieces of legislation, a child is differently defined because of the confines of that particular legislation. We give a chronological age, rather than simply leaving it as &quot;a child&quot;, for the reasons implicit in the intervention of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk.
</p>

<a name="60116-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>I hope I have reassured the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, on Amendment No. 16A. Amendment No. 16B would, in effect, prevent the Secretary of State from transferring any information from the children&#039;s register to the national identity register without the written permission of the parent or guardian. We have no plans to reduce the age of registration. The ID cards scheme is being designed for those aged 16 and over. However, that is not to say that there may not be good reason to vary this age in future. Any orders laid under this section will, as the noble Baroness knows, be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Therefore Parliament would have to agree to any modification of the age of registration. It is one of those issues which we can be quite definitive about, particularly on the new way in which we will use affirmative resolution.
</p>

<a name="60116-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>The proper time for discussions relating to the children&#039;s register will therefore be if and when the Secretary of State lays an order to reduce the age of registration. As I have already made clear, Parliament will have ample opportunity to debate such points. In any case, the children&#039;s register has not yet been set up. It is premature to discuss the interfaces between the NIR and databases which are not yet in existence.
</p>

<a name="60116-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>However, it is right that I should reassure the House that we have no plans to obtain information from the children&#039;s register. Indeed, to do so would require the express authorisation of Parliament via an affirmative order under Clause 11.
</p>

<a name="60116-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>In addition, the children&#039;s register and the national identity register have two very different functions, which the noble Baroness was kind enough to allude to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_520"></a>

in her remarks. The NIR is a database concerned with the identification of individuals, whereas the children&#039;s register will allow practitioners to share information about children in order to improve their well-being and to safeguard and promote their welfare. The noble Baroness will know as well as anyone that one of the difficulties we have had historically in dealing with children&#039;s issues is when information is held but not shared, so that unfortunately a proper informed decision is not made. Children then fall through the net in a way that causes us all great pain and anguish. Hopefully this is a means of stopping that happening.
</p>

<a name="60116-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>In the same way the NIR will not hold details in relation to medical or tax records. It will not hold any information that might relate to the welfare of children. Therefore, it is our view that the amendment is unnecessary. I assure the noble Baroness that I am particularly concerned about how this will work for some very obvious reasons, with which she will be only too familiar.
</p>

<a name="60116-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>I hope that I have answered the noble Baroness&#039;s concerns on those two matters so that she will feel content, and that other noble Lords will agree that it is not necessary to bring the matter back.

<a name="60116-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>I begin by thanking the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee for its good work in examining the Bill and for its helpful recommendations. I foreshadowed many of the amendments in Committee, and indeed might have even hinted at some at Second Reading. I shall write to the committee shortly to repeat that gratitude, which should be formally conveyed, and I am happy to announce that we have accepted all its recommendations. A large part of the group consists of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_521"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 521</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendments to achieve that. A further government Amendment No. 35 in response to a committee concern regarding the power to designate documents will be moved in its own place.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>Eight of the group of amendments take up committee recommendations that certain negative resolution powers in the Bill should be changed to affirmative resolutions. I shall not take up the House&#039;s time by expanding on them at length, but shall simply list their effects for the purposes of clarity.

</p>

<a name="60116-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>Amendment No. 43 makes the first set of regulations made under Clause 5&#151;that is, regulations that prescribe the manner of, and the information that must accompany, an application for registration&#151;subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Amendment No. 55 makes the power to prescribe the registrable facts in Clause 8(4)(b), on which a requirement to issue an ID card rests, subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Amendment No. 58 makes the power to prescribe requirements that an ID card issued by a designated document authority must satisfy subject to the affirmative procedure. Amendment No. 61 makes the first set of regulations made under Clause 12&#151;that is, regulations about the obligation to notify the Secretary of State of changes of circumstances and matters of that sort&#151;subject to the affirmative procedure.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>Amendment No. 68 provides for all the delegated powers in Clause 19, which provides for provision of information from the register without consent, to be subject to the affirmative procedure. Amendment No. 108, which applies to Clause 37, provides that all fee regulations will be subject to affirmative resolution, apart from rises that simply take account of inflation. Amendment No. 118 removes the reference to power given to a &quot;prescribed person&quot; in Clause 43 so that it rests solely with the Secretary of State and Amendment No. 73 makes a consequential adjustment to Clause 23.

</p>

<a name="60116-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>The rest of the group consists of a number of technical amendments. Some simply rephrase the wording in order to provide greater clarity or consistency. Others respond to the fact that most of the order-making powers are now under the affirmative procedure. In effect, the negative resolution procedure is no longer the default setting for order-making powers. These technical amendments are: Amendment No. 17, which relates to Clause 2; Amendment No. 24, which relates to Clause 3; Amendment No. 36, which relates to Clause 4; Amendment No. 64, which relates to Clause 14; Amendment No. 75, which relates to Clause 23; Amendment No. 106, which relates to Clause 36; Amendment No. 107, which relates to Clause 37; Amendments Nos. 109 and 110, which relate to Clause 40; and Amendments Nos. 112 to 115 which relate to Clause 41. I do not propose to weary the House by describing these amendments in detail, but can supply an explanation if requested. On that basis, I hope that the amendments will be agreed to. I notice that the noble Baroness is concerned and I hope I have not left anything out. I beg to move.

However, I may have misheard something that the Minister said or I may be misreading the list of groupings. I thought the Minister referred to Amendment No. 64 as part of this group. I wonder whether I misheard that because it is in another group. Can the Minister assist me?

<a name="60116-29_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I have Amendment No. 64 in my speaking notes but I shall check to see whether it is Amendment No. 63. Amendment No. 64 relates to Clause 14. I believe it is in this group.

<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="60116-29_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is right. My notes should have said Amendment No. 66. Amendment No. 64 was a misprint.

<p><a name="st_181"></a>
<a name="60116-29_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I seek clarification on Amendment No. 118. I am always very beady-eyed about prescribed regulations and so on, and the definition of &quot;prescribed&quot;, which must occur a hundred times in the Bill, is on page 37 and is part of Clause 43. Amendment No. 118 strikes out from the word &quot;state&quot; to the end of the definition. That would mean that we are left with a definition that &quot;prescribed&quot; means:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State&quot;,</p>

</p>

<a name="60116-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>Am I right in thinking that they would have allowed regulations to be prescribed by delegation; that is, that there could have been prescribed regulations which permitted regulations to be prescribed by somebody else? If that is what the omission of those words means, I am a happy fellow indeed. We will all cheer and, since good news is hard to find in this Bill, I want that opportunity. If I keep talking, news may come flashing back from the ether, but that is my question to the Minister.

<br>
(   )   Information may not be recorded in the Register unless it is&#150;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_185"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I move this amendment on behalf of my noble friend. With the leave of the House, I will speak to the other amendments in the group, the consequential government amendments Amendments Nos. 21 to 23 and Amendments Nos. 19 and 42 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>First, Amendment No. 18 is intended to respond to a concern raised from the Opposition Benches in Committee; namely, that it was not clear in the Bill that anything held on the national identity register and, thus, the detailed list set out in Schedule 1 must be in accordance with the statutory purposes of the scheme. The statutory purposes, as we have already discussed at length, are twofold: first, to provide a convenient method for individuals to prove their identity&#151;registrable facts about themselves to others who reasonably require them&#151;and, secondly, the provision of a secure and reliable method for registrable facts to be ascertained or verified where that is in the public interest.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>Amendment No. 18 amends Clause 3 to make it absolutely clear that the information that may be held on the register, including, of course, the information listed in Schedule 1, must be consistent with the statutory purposes of the scheme. The amendment makes it clear that no information may be entered in the register unless it is consistent with the statutory purposes, and, once entered, it may continue to be recorded there,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>&quot;only if and for so long as it is consistent with the statutory purposes&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>Amendments Nos. 21 to 23 are purely consequential. They remove subsections (4) and (6), which prevent information being added or continuing to be held on the register if it is inconsistent with the statutory purposes. Those subsections now become redundant because they are encompassed in Amendment No. 18.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has tabled an alternative, Amendment No. 19. That would link what is held on the register by virtue of Schedule 1 to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_524"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 524</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&quot;registrable facts&quot; listed at Clause 1(5). In effect, the noble Lord&#039;s amendment conflates the registrable facts with Schedule 1. We are afraid that it would place an unnecessary and unworkable limitation on that schedule. Before I explain why that limitation would be unworkable, I will remind noble Lords of the distinction between the registrable facts and Schedule 1.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>As noble Lords are aware, the purpose of the scheme is to create means by which people can identify themselves and can be identified. The process of identification is tied down&#151;defined, as it were&#151;in the Bill by the registrable facts. The scheme revolves around that list of key pieces of identification information. The list of registrable facts at Clause 1(5) is therefore an absolutely crucial component of the statutory purposes, but it should be kept in mind that, however crucial, it is just a component. The registrable facts must be seen in light of the statutory purposes as a whole. Those statutory purposes provide the overriding principle that determines and limits the information that may, by virtue of Clause 3 and Schedule 1, be held on the register. For that reason, Amendment No. 18 focuses on the statutory purposes, in contrast to Amendment No. 19, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, which focuses on one component of the statutory purposes, namely the registrable facts.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>I hope that, from that explanation, it is apparent why the key concept for limiting the contents of the register is the statutory purposes as a whole and not just the registrable facts. However, by way of illustration, I will briefly explain why it will be necessary to hold information on the register in support of the registrable facts, and thus the statutory purposes as a whole, even though that information is not itself contained in the list of registrable facts.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>I hope that, if that sounds like a contradiction, the following examples will shed some light. First, under Clause 1(5)(e), a person&#039;s current residential status is a registrable fact, and that includes nationality as specified at Clause 1(8)(a). Thus in confirming someone&#039;s identity it will be possible for their nationality to be confirmed&#151;for example, by being printed visibly on the face of the identity card. However, in order to establish a person&#039;s nationality, it will be necessary for the agency issuing identity cards to see supporting evidence&#151;for example, a birth certificate and evidence of the person&#039;s parents&#039; nationality&#151;exactly the sort of evidence that the United Kingdom Passport Service needs to see now when considering an application for a passport.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>Details of that evidence&#151;for example, the number and date and place of issue of the birth certificate&#151;would be held on the register in accordance with paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 as validation information. That evidence will continue to be held as it may need to be referred to in future if ever there was any concern about the person&#039;s entitlement to the nationality claimed. The person&#039;s nationality would be a registrable fact but not the supporting evidence. Both would need to be held on the register for the scheme to meet its statutory purposes.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_525"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 525</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>If only registrable facts could be held on the register then the supporting evidence could not itself be held unless it were made registrable facts. We would not want all of the supporting evidence to be classed as registrable facts, otherwise it could in theory be made available when someone sought to prove their identity, and we do not believe that that would be right.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>Another example would be security information such as a password that someone might be asked to provide to allow for authentication in the absence of a biometric check. Let us say that someone is asked for their favourite colour as a security password and that that colour is purple. The fact that purple is that person&#039;s favourite colour would be held on the register as part of the security information in accordance with paragraph 8(b) of Schedule 1. However, that person&#039;s favourite colour would not itself be a registrable fact. Also, if on renewing the identity card a different password was chosen&#151;let us say mother&#039;s maiden name&#151;it is likely that the first one would simply be deleted as it would no longer be in accordance with the statutory purposes to hold information about that person&#039;s favourite colour on the register.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>The other amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, Amendment No. 42, would add a pointer in Clause 5(5)(d) to the information held in the register under Clause 3. Thus it would only be information that could be recorded in the register that might be requested when someone made an application to be entered in the register and issued with an identity card. Again, we think that that would be an unnecessary limitation as it is possible that someone applying for an identity card might be asked to provide information to confirm the information to be recorded on the register that would not itself be information that would, or indeed could, be held. Again, the key safeguard here is set out in Clause 5(6). The purpose of asking for information to verify an application for an identity card must of necessity be in order to comply with the statutory purposes of the national identity register and the identity card scheme itself.
</p>

<a name="60116-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>In view of that explanation and the government amendments that have been tabled, I hope that it is now much clearer that only information that supports the statutory purposes of the scheme can be held on the register and that any information on the register must be as provided for in Clause 3 and Schedule 1. I hope that the clarification that I have provided to the noble Lord will enable him to withdraw Amendments Nos. 19 and 42. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="60116-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, we are all in the debt of the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, because of his full explanation of this group of amendments and of the Government&#039;s objections to Amendments Nos. 19 and 42. I do not know whether the treacle pudding has got the better of me, but I will have to study his reply rather carefully away from the Chamber, because I did not follow it dot and comma.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>Indeed, I got a bit anxious at one point. One belief that we have all been clinging to is that Clause 1 prescribes everything that can go into Schedule 1 and that if something is not within the purview of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 526</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

registrable facts, it cannot be in the schedule. The reply at least made it clear that evidence behind the registrable facts can be on the register. I must be honest and say that hitherto I had not taken cognisance of that. I am somewhat relieved to see that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, is in the same position.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>The matter needs a good deal more thought. Evidence supporting registrable facts could be quite extensive and make the pool into which the security services, the police and so on can dip that much deeper and broader. At this moment, however, the only proper thing is for me to withdraw my amendments. There may need to be some discussions before Third Reading; I am sure that the noble Lord and the noble Baroness will welcome that. If necessary, we may have to go further, but let us hope not.

<a name="60116-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>Although it was one of the more light-hearted debates in Committee, the concerns raised by my noble friend Lord Northesk stimulated an important discussion. As he said, allowing the Bill to state only &quot;head&quot; could mean that some,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a>&quot;refusenik might arrive to have his biometric captured and sit with his back to the capture machine, which would be a complete waste of everyone&#039;s time&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/12/05; col. 982.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>Indeed, the fact that we had to have the debate only goes to show the importance of precision in statute and the fact that the Government had failed to consider such precision or thought through the finer details of the working of the Bill and the system proposed. Unfortunately, that is a recurring theme, not only in this legislation.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>In light of that, I move on to Amendment No. 41, tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Anelay of St Johns. Amendment No. 29 enabled me not to move Amendment No. 28. However, I still believe that a consequential amendment to Clause 5(5)(c), as a result of that change, is necessary. It could reflect the wording that the Government have decided to use in Amendment No. 29, rather than that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_528"></a>

proposed in Amendment No. 41. I would very much like the Minister to confirm that she will reflect on that point or accept ours.

<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="60116-30_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, I cannot help but reflect with some amusement that we had a full discussion about wearing your face on the front of your head and not on the back, whereas we allowed to pass rather quickly the fact that the noble Baroness accepted all the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in a previous group of amendments. That was the most enormous move; I was looking at them, and it is much to the Government&#039;s credit that they have accepted all those carefully thought-out amendments. I am no longer a member of the committee, but it had done some deep thinking about this. It is a lovely contrast, and I think that the amendment is delightful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="60116-30_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that compliment. We thought that the committee did a thorough job. We gave serious consideration to its recommendations and were happy to accede to them. Indeed, we do not think that Amendment No. 41 is necessary, for the reasons that I gave.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>I apologise to the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe. I am sure that message went to the Box, and I am sure that it must have been with me, but I did not get it and I apologise for not having got it. That is why I was a little slow in jumping to my feet, but I am grateful to the noble Baroness and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for not moving Amendment No. 28. I would have thanked them more profusely had I known of it when I first got to my feet.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>We looked at whether Amendment No. 41 was a consequential amendment to our Amendment No. 29. We are clear that, having tabled Amendment No. 29, no other amendment to the Bill is necessary. As always, we will reflect on that but, looking at those amendments, I believe that to be the correct position. No further amendment should be necessary.

</p>

<a name="60116-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>Basically, paragraph 8 of Schedule 1, concerning security information, lists the sort of things you might want for a rather conventional current banking system. You would recognise the first two&#151;the sort of things one might have in a chip and PIN system, as rolled out through supermarkets. Then in sub-paragraph (c) are questions and answers, or challenge and response as it is sometimes referred to, for trying to find out if a person is a person when they have forgotten their PIN.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60116-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>That all looks absolutely fine, but the way they have worded it makes it look as if they want to keep the personal identification number clearly. That is quite common in some cases, but a lot of more secure systems are moving to keep that in an encrypted or hashed form, where one can use it to verify the number that is coming down the line but the person looking at the database cannot actually read the number. That therefore secures against data leakage.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>Equally so, if you are doing that, you do not want just to generate some code from the personal identification number, but to have something there where you might need to verify a hashed number coming in from the terminal. I made a mistake in my amendment, so we would need to come back&#151;the Government might want put something in on Third Reading or they may wish to ignore it for reasons I will mention in half a second&#151;and probably ought to put in &quot;generating or verifying&quot;, so that you cover both the currently envisaged system with fairly low cryptographic security but also encompass some newer ones coming along where you might want higher security. The trouble with this is that you have painted yourself into a corner.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>I was very pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, say in his response to Amendment No. 4&#151;talking about the Data Protection Act 1998&#151;that you want to keep everything in a very secure manner. Therefore, I imagine you would want to move forwards. The thing is that in the more modern systems, you may well want to move to what they call strong asymmetric mutual authentication, where you generate a password one end and it is decrypted at the other end with a different password. This is all to do with public key encryption and sometimes digital signatures&#151;they are a particular case of it. There is a lot of work going on in this area.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>You do not necessarily need to go so strongly into this area if you are using the current supermarket and credit card chip and PIN, where you have terminal in a known place, with a known serial or security number, and things like that, all nailed down. Then you can get away with this weaker stuff. The problem comes with what the noble Baroness said earlier about people being able to change their addresses easily online.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>If you are going to make it easy for people to go online from their computers or some other terminal and key in their ID number and their PIN to identify themselves, or perhaps through questions and answers&#151;a bit like some of the banks do at the moment&#151;and that is all held and clear at the other end, the trouble is that it is not very secure. That is prone to phishing and hacking attacks and, nowadays that it is done from personal computers, to Trojans that can sit there. You will probably not permit it at the moment, with the sort of technology we are talking about here.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>If you want to move to more advanced technology&#151;the sort of stuff that is coming out over the next two to three years&#151;you are also going to have to keep encrypted data in the database. There are some <br>&nbsp;<br>

international standards probably going to emerge in this area, to be widely available and of which the Government I am sure will want to avail themselves. You may want to encrypt anyway, to keep it more secure. I suggest that you go back and look at this, because you do not want to block out the chance of going to the newer stuff.
</p>

<a name="60116-30_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>I was told that it will not matter because, under Clause 3(1)(b), you will be allowed to put in technical information. All this security information currently comes under Clause 3(1)(a), which states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a>&quot;information the inclusion of which in an individual&#039;s entry is authorised by Schedule 1&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-30_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>Security information is classified under Clause 3(1)(a) and not under Clause 3(1)(b). One might say that if the technical stuff changes, we could put it under Clause 3(1)(b) and change what one holds against someone&#039;s entry. However, assuming my understanding of how the legal mind works is correct, if one has explicitly stated that security information is covered under Clause 3(1)(a), it cannot be included under Clause 3(1)(b). That paragraph must refer to other sorts of technical information. Its inclusion under Clause 3(1)(a) will not be permitted. If someone with the old technology decided to make mischief, he might take a case to court and say, &quot;Actually, under the Act, you weren&#039;t allowed to move to better stuff, because you weren&#039;t permitted to keep the stuff on the register which would allow you to move to more secure cryptographic techniques. It must be excluded or it would have been in there in the first place because of Clause 3(1)(a)&quot;. I know that that sounds like a terrible muddle, but if one reads the amendment, it should work out. Paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 should be more inclusive. It should not be limited to unencrypted data. I beg to move.

<a name="60116-31_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may be &quot;telegraphic&quot;&#151;to borrow a word that is quite often by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;and say to the noble Earl that I understand his concerns, but they are not merited. I understand that he is saying that the legislation may restrict our taking advantage of the technological advancements that are now in being or are anticipated in the next two or three years and prohibit us availing ourselves of the technology which enables us to encrypt data at both ends. In short, we do not believe that that is so. The way in which the Bill is currently drawn will enable us to take advantage of those technological developments and hold encrypted data. I can therefore assure the noble Earl that when a person seeks to update his details online, he will not be accessing the register directly. With regard to security of PIN, we are investigating the use of the new technology&#151;to which the noble Earl referred&#151;which utilises PKI infrastructures to ensure that remote transactions can be conducted more securely. For example, a change in address can be held in the system to enable those who will then put that information into the register to deal with it. There will be no direct access. The breach about which the noble Earl was concerned could not take place in that way.

We believe that the framework that this Bill provides enables us to do that without some of the problems that he envisaged.

(b)   shall be so recorded where the individual has not consented to the provision of the information&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_206"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, moving this amendment at this time of night will not be easy. This part of the Bill has, I suspect, been somewhat orphaned, because we all agree that paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 is particularly important because, as it stands, it allows collection of what one might call a second set of information with regard to every use that is made of an identity card.
</p>

<a name="60116-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>As the Bill stands, any of us will be able to give consent under Clause 14 for our identity cards to be used for verification purposes that will give the verifying authority or commercial entity the right to look at everything on our entry in the register, except the records referred to in Schedule 1(9). That information is available, as I understand it, only under Clause 20(4), whereby, under Section 17 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, one can call upon certain information,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83"></a>&quot;for purposes connected with the prevention or detection of serious crime&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>I am the first to accept that the definition of &quot;serious&quot; is a high hurdle. We were talking earlier about the right level of seriousness of offence to trigger the provisions of the Bill. &quot;Serious crime&quot; as defined in the Bill is indeed serious crime. None the less, access to paragraph 9 information is available to those who satisfy the Clause 20 test without the consent of the person whose information has been recorded under paragraph 9. We are dealing with what is commonly called the &quot;audit trail&quot;, and my amendment&#151;and I am grateful for the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, and my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford&#151;seeks to turn around the present provisions of the Bill in two regards. First, it says that one must give two consents, if the audit trail of the information recorded on one&#039;s register is to be captured.
</p>

<a name="60116-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>The first consent is the use of the card for verification purposes. We have no problem with Clause 14 as it stands; the problem is that we think there should be a second consent for the capture of what you might call the audit trail information. If I use my card at a hotel it will be used to verify where the hotel is and, under paragraph 9, other information beside, to do with each and every use of my card. As has been specifically warned against by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the information that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_533"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 533</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

can be stored under the provision, and the audit trail which will be established by it will, as the committee&#039;s report put it,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_84"></a>&quot;include a record of the occasions on which his or her entry on the Register has been accessed by others . . . for example, in the use of public services, or by prospective employers, or as part of criminal investigations (regardless of whether these result in prosecutions or convictions). Thus the information held on the Register may amount to a detailed account of their private life&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>That is very much the line taken by the Information Commissioner.
</p>

<a name="60116-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>I urge those of your Lordships who have not had a chance to do so to look at the report that the Information Commissioner issued in October, which spends a great deal of time and energy pointing specifically to the danger of the audit trail provisions, of which I shall read one part. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85"></a>&quot;The extent of the information retained as a core part of the National Identity Register is unwarranted and intrusive&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>That comes from the report of the Information Commissioner, who is there to protect all our data against unwarranted access. He goes on to say that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_86"></a>&quot;the system of operation envisaged by the government also raises additional serious concerns. The government proposes that a data trail should be created of when a card is checked against the National Identity Register. This will show who checked it and when. The government has made clear that the system of operation it favours involves checks by service providers back to the National Identity Register thus building up a picture of an individuals&#039; card use and a detailed picture from this of how they live their lives. Other systems of checks are perfectly feasible such as a local card reader and biometric reader verifying identity, removing the need for central records to be kept and minimising the risks and costs associated with developing a complex IT infrastructure&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>The Information Commissioner goes on to raise his own concerns about whether the scheme is compliant with the European convention and the Human Rights Act.
</p>

<a name="60116-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>I shall not quote what it said, but the Select Committee on the Constitution in its third report also put emphasis on this whole part of the Bill. We need to keep remembering that the onus should be on the state to prove the public need justifying intrusion into our own data and privacy. It is easy to slip into a reverse assumption when one gets embedded in a Bill of this kind and becomes almost establishment-minded.
</p>

<a name="60116-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>What the amendment seeks to do is, in its first part, relatively simple. It says that there must be two consents if there is to be a data trail captured on our file in the national identity register. The first consent, under Clause 14, will be for use of our card to verify our identity. Fine, no problem; but there must be a second consent which must be given at the time when the card is used&#151;and I am assured by those who know much more about this than I do, including the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, that it is relatively straightforward. On every occasion on which the card is used for identification purposes, there would be a button to be pressed which would consent to the storing of the information as to the circumstances of use of the card&#151;the audit trail information. We say that in order to satisfy the concerns of the committees I have mentioned, the Information Commissioner and indeed our views on all this&#151;and I think I speak for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_534"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 534</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Conservative Benches as well&#151;we can deal with it by the amendment given here, which would require at least a double consent: one consent for the verification, but a second consent for the capture of the audit trail information.
</p>

<a name="60116-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>The second part of the amendment, paragraph (b), is almost counter-intuitive: when our information is being accessed by, for example, the security authorities or the police, then they shall record the occasion of accessing our data, because that will not be an occasion to which we have consented. If the Government are inclined to say, &quot;We can&#039;t have that, because it would blow apart the security operation or police operation, because it would allow us to require under the Data Protection Act the details of the accessing of that information&quot;, the answer is that there are many protections under the Data Protection Act 1998, particularly Sections 28 and 29, the first of which exempts national security information and the second of which exempts from disclosure information that would be prejudicial to the prevention or detection of crime.
</p>

<a name="60116-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>That is a galloping explanation of an amendment that is not exactly easy, but which we believe is very important. I should pay tribute to Caspar Bowden, who has been one of the greatest servants to this place with regard to data protection matters over the past seven or eight years; one of those members of the public whose <i>pro bono</i> activities inform and enhance the work we do in this House. It was largely due to his promptings that this amendment has come in at this stage. I apologise for it not having come in at the previous stage, but better late than never.
</p>

<a name="60116-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>This matter cannot be dealt with tonight, and I am pretty certain, unless the Minister in responding to this amendment says alarmingly unexpected things, we probably ought to deal with this again on Third Reading. I will sit down at this juncture. I beg to move.

<a name="60116-32_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, my name is on this amendment, and I strongly support it. We have reached one of the most important amendments we will deal with during our long debates on Report. For technical reasons it simply was not possible for this amendment to be tabled until Thursday, when it was all worked out. I put on the record my thanks to Liberty for being able to turn around so quickly a response to this specific amendment. They try to do great service to noble Lords and Members of another place.
</p>

<a name="60116-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>Amendment No. 33 provides that, in situations where the person has consented, the particulars should not be recorded unless they wish that this be done. However, in any situation where consent has not been given, that should be recorded. The rationale behind the amendment&#151;I am putting this in a simple way, as I had to in order to explain it to myself&#151;is that if a record is kept every time a person voluntarily uses their card, a detailed record of their habits and movements can soon build up. I expressed my concerns about the audit trail on Amendment No. 6 earlier today. As the purpose of the NIR is to provide a means of identification, it would not be appropriate also to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_535"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 535</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

allow it to build up so much detailed information on those entered on the register. We argue, therefore, that this information should not be recorded.
</p>

<a name="60116-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>Conversely, when access takes place without consent, it is certain to be by one of the state agencies authorised by Clauses 19 to 23, as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, explained. As we have commented throughout the passage of this Bill, the grounds for access are exceedingly broad. In particular, the security agencies, authorised under Clause 19(2), need no justification for access to the register so long as it falls within the statutory duties of that agency. Because of this, it is extremely important that some degree of accountability is imposed by ensuring that any such access be recorded. It would be difficult for the National Identity Scheme Commissioner effectively to carry out his functions under Clause 24. While the Commissioner will not keep under review specific access by the security services, he does have a duty, under 24(2)(c), to review the arrangements made by persons to whom information is provided.


</p>

<a name="60116-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>We think that it is clearly desirable in our democratic society that some record of any state access to information should be made even if, as in this case, there is no public access to that record.
</p>

<a name="60116-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is right. At this stage, the amendment is probing in nature. There are some complex and technical issues as well as security issues and matters of principle underlying the amendment. Even if it were not late at night, it would be right to give the Government a full opportunity to address the arguments in the amendment and for us to talk about it behind the scenes before Third Reading. In one way we seek to ensure better drafting of the Bill but there is a deep difference between us on a matter of principle. We may not be able to resolve that but the Government may be able to give a better explanation, which may assuage some if not all of us.

<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="60116-32_spnew1"></a><b>  The Earl of Erroll: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may explain why I have put my name to the amendment. The purpose of the national identity register is to prove one&#039;s identity. We are told continually that it is not Big Brother and its purpose is not to track an individual. We are then told that the purpose of the audit trail is to be able to track identity theft. In other words, is your identity being stolen? Apart from those audit trails undertaken by intelligence services, the only person who knows when you did or did not use the card is you. The theory is simple. If you were there, offered up the card and the access occurred in front of you, you know that it took place. Therefore, there is nothing to be gained by having the information stored because you already know that it has happened; you will know whether your identity has been stolen. It would not be difficult to press a button which states whether or not you permit the storage of the fact that there has been access to the national identity register.
</p>

<a name="60116-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>An exemption may need to be included&#151;that is perhaps why the issue should be left until Third Reading&#151;to provide that if you are stopped as a result <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_536"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 536</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of some matter of national security, and it is felt that you were involved, the security services may want to keep on file the fact that you were stopped. That is a difficult provision to frame and it is for government to do so. But it is not necessary to know when normal activities took place&#151;going to a bank, and all the other purposes which are supposed to help with the efficient provision of government services. There could be some embarrassing situations. People could leave themselves open to blackmail because they were not where they had told someone they would be at that time. It would be very dangerous to have every single access recorded. As a matter of privacy, it is important that these amendments are accepted.

<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="60116-32_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I understand noble Lords&#039; anxiety although in this case, again, I believe that it is misplaced. I understand that two or three minutes past 10 is not the opportunity for me to expound on all the reasons why they are misplaced. In a fairly truncated form, perhaps I may say why we think the safeguards suffice. I shall be happy to write more fully to noble Lords. Indeed, perhaps between now and Third Reading we can further amplify issues which may still be causing anxiety. As the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, so helpfully suggested, if they cannot be dealt with, then at Third Reading we would know the dividing lines and can deal with them at that stage.
</p>

<a name="60116-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>Perhaps I may remind noble Lords that the most important matter is that the audit log is essentially a safeguard for the individual as it allows an individual to check where and when information has been verified or provided to an organisation. The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, may have an exemplary recall of every transaction he has ever made but that is not the experience of all of us. Sometimes we need an <i>aide-m&#233;moire</i> to jog our memories as to where we might have been. In any event, if an individual had to consent to this provision of information being recorded, that could also create a loophole in the scheme which could be exploited by fraudsters. Perhaps I may explain why I say that.
</p>

<a name="60116-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>Certain types of fraud, especially financial fraud, are often detected by the pattern of usage. Someone attempting to engage in this sort of fraud will no doubt be aware of that and will therefore not wish to have the provision of information recorded in case it assists in the detection of his activities. The record of the provision of information will assist with any disputes over what information has been provided. For example, someone may consent to his record being verified but state that he does not wish the provision of the information to be recorded in the audit log. If he later complains that the organisation was provided with information that he had not consented to, it will be impossible for the agency to check back and confirm exactly what information was provided.
</p>

<a name="60116-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>I hope that I have reassured noble Lords that the audit log is a safeguard which is of benefit to the individual, as opposed to a disadvantage. Officials in the agency operating the identity card scheme will determine, on behalf of the Secretary of State, whether <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_537"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column 537</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

audit log information may be provided to the police or government department under Clause 19. Noble Lords will remember that that information can be only for the purposes of serious crime. In practice, we expect to establish a specialised section in the agency, staffed by officials with a high security clearance, to deal with requests for audit log information. I hope that noble Lords will remember that I said in our earlier debates that this information will not be generally available; it will be available to the individual, who will want to check the use to which the information has been put in order that he can verify and challenge, as appropriate.

<a name="60116-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am terribly sorry to interrupt, but I think that the noble Baroness may be wrong in referring to Clause 19.

</p>

<a name="60116-33_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am very happy to look at it. It is difficult when we are doing it on the hoof. I thought it was included, but it may be better if we look at the precise detail of Clauses 19 and 20. We believe that it relates to both those clauses. To make it clear, I shall write to the noble Lord and I shall be happy to discuss the matter outside the Chamber. I hope we shall have a joint resolution on the issue, even if we do not agree on the consequences of it at the end of the day.

To that extent we are agreed. It looks as though we are not necessarily agreed on whether it is necessary to authorise the keeping of that record on each occasion. Your Lordships have our point about being able to frustrate fraud and people who may want to take advantage of any perceived lacunae.

<p>Clause 2 [<i>Provision of regulated claims management services</i>]:
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60116-33_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 27A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 2, line 2, after &quot;by&quot; insert &quot;the Secretary of State under the transitional provisions made under section 7(3) or&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment gives us an opportunity to pause and reflect for a moment on the need for transitional provisions, given the urgency of the overall situation. Amendment No. 27A would insert the proposed text after,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;&#039;authorised person&#039; means a person authorised by&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>It may be for the convenience of the Committee if we group Amendment No. 51, which would turn a &quot;may&quot; into a &quot;shall&quot; on page 3, Clause 3(8). I hope that the Minister will reflect for a moment that under Amendment No. 51 we are seeking to state that while no person is designated under subsection (1) as the regulator, the Secretary of State shall exercise the functions of the regulator so that there is no gap. In Amendment No. 67A, we have sought to amend Clause 7(3) so that it reads:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;Regulations shall make transitional provision about the extent to which the Secretary of State shall exercise functions arising under this Part, prior to him designating a Regulator&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>I hope that this will also be an opportunity for the Minister to bring us up to date with any developments that may well have taken place since the previous Committee sitting. However, two themes will inevitably emerge as we deal with the remainder of the Bill: first, to ensure that there are no loopholes in the legislation that can easily be exploited; and, secondly, to ensure that as much material as possible is set out in the Bill and is not left to secondary legislation.
</p>

<a name="60116-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>When considering claims management companies, it is always important for us to remind ourselves of the background against which this legislation will sit. This is an industry which has grown up to fill a gap in the market. That gap arose when the present funding arrangements for claims were introduced, which is why the market has remained unregulated until now.
</p>

<a name="60116-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>However, I recall&#151;I have quoted from this report before&#151;the very good report of the Better Regulation Task Force, <i>Better Routes to Redress</i>, in which one of its main themes was an implied and explicit criticism of claims management companies. Page 21 of the report states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;the sector was characterised by hard-sell advertising and direct-marketing which encouraged people to &#039;have a go&#039; even if there was little chance of actually achieving the large payout being dangled as an inducement. We heard about people being <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_GC142"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC142</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>encouraged to make claims for tripping over the same paving slab or driving over the same pothole. Ultimately the whole sector was brought into disrepute&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>There were many in the industry who expressed concern at that time. Indeed, the Better Regulation Task Force said that it cropped up at virtually all of its meetings.
</p>

<a name="60116-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>I can readily understand the Government&#039;s response that regulation should be a matter for companies under the doctrine of self-regulation. We saw that with the general insurance sector setting up the General Insurance Standards Council&#151;GISC. I think that the Government were probably quite pleased with the way that that developed until the European Commission and the European Union decided to introduce compulsory, statutory regulation. Therefore, the work of GISC was handed over to the Financial Services Authority.
</p>

<a name="60116-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>I think that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor hoped that that would be the way regulation of the claims management sector should develop. Of course, it went badly wrong. I think that it went badly wrong because into the market place came a whole range of individuals and companies who were there for profit and not there to look after the victim. The Better Regulation Task Force pleaded with the sector to &quot;bring itself into order&quot;&#151;I think that that was the phrase it used&#151;and that if it failed to do so, the DCA would step in and regulate the sector. Ultimately, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor appears to have changed his mind overnight between 21 and 22 March. It is an interesting turnaround. At some time, I hope that someone will explain it to me. But on 21 March 2005, the noble and   learned Lord, at the Legal Services Reform Conference, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;There has been a lot of concern recently about claims management companies . . . I welcome the steps the Claims Standards Council has been taking to try and respond to these issues. But I will be looking carefully to see how the protection of consumers&#039; interest can be improved&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Twenty four hours can be a long time in politics: lo and behold, the following day, the noble and learned Lord said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;Voluntary self-regulation has a role, but obviously we cannot rely on it. Some statutory teeth are needed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>He also said, and I repeat that this was on the following day:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;I believe the time has come to take clear and firm action. So I can announce today that we will legislate on claims managers. We will use the law to regulate their activities&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>and here we are. It may be that the noble and learned Lord did not have the necessary sanction from colleagues to make the announcement on the previous day. I do not want the Minister to think that I am in any way being critical, because I very much welcome the clear and firm statement made on 22 March.
</p>

<a name="60116-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>To explain why&#151;this is really what this amendment is all about&#151;the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor stressed that if statutory regulation was to   be introduced, it would need to be introduced <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC143"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC143</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&quot;quickly&quot;. I quote the word &quot;quickly&quot; from his speech of 22 March. He had previously in the same speech said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;I said in November that the claims management sector must be properly regulated. I said that high pressure selling, sharp practices and targeting vulnerable people must stop&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>He recapped&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;We hear of people being stopped in the high street and being asked to make a claim, harassed to sign agreements which they may not understand. Others receive persistent phone calls pushing them to make a claim. Some are visited again and again until finally they are persuaded to pursue a claim&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>My summary of these very good comments is that we need to see action taken now.
</p>

<a name="60116-33_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to bring us up to date with what has happened since the previous Committee day. As the Committee knows, I have been pressing all along for action to be immediate. We have now reached the position where the industry has palpably failed at its attempts at self-regulation. I believe that the wider public perception of the industry is at a low ebb. For that reason we need clear and precise regulation which will be really effective and will, by means of appropriate transitional provisions, have immediate effect upon enactment.
</p>

<a name="60116-33_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Much of today&#039;s debate, particularly on the amendments that follow, will be about gaps. I believe that the Minister and the Committee share the intention that there should be no gaps in the regulatory cover, no loopholes in the provisions, no &quot;wriggle&quot; room, no types of relevant activity left out, no types of relevant people missed and&#151;to my mind most important of all&#151;no gaps in time. That is really what this amendment is all about.

</p>

<a name="60116-33_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>I give two examples of the way in which the situation has deteriorated. An article appeared in <i>Insurancetimes</i> in August headed,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;Scheming claims firms prey on patients&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>It stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;Dodgy claims management companies are forging the NHS kitemark on promotional literature and commandeering old ambulances to illegally target vulnerable hospital patients&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>That concerned a case where an ambulance was parked outside an accident and emergency department and people attending hospital were encouraged to make their claim with that particular company. It was later disclosed that the personal injury care line concerned was a member of the Claims Standards Council. Such incidents give rise to concern.
</p>

<a name="60116-33_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>The second area relates to an article that appeared in <i>The Lawyer</i>, again in August, headed &quot;Blood Money&quot;, with the sub-heading,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;The ambulance-chasers are back, this time offering their services to victims of the London bombings&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>It stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;Claims companies are trying to make money out of the bombings by luring people into agreements that will entitle the claims companies to large shares of compensation payments&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<a name="60116-33_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>That was a quotation from the President of the Law Society, who then explained,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;The Law Society went public after it was contacted by victims of the bombings who had already telephoned claims companies&#151;one had offered its services on a &#039;no win, no fee&#039; basis under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (Cica) scheme for one-fifth plus a cut of the compensation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The President of the Law Society pointed out that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;&#039;no win, no fee&#039; is inappropriate, because the bomb claims are &#039;almost certain to succeed&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-33_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Those are two examples of where things are happening as we speak. I dare to confess to the Committee that I have surfed the Internet and have found a number of other rather disquieting developments to report when we discuss later amendments.

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Amendment No. 51 speaks for itself. This is one of the areas where, if there is a gap in time&#151;whether before a regulator has been set up or between regimes&#151;the Lord Chancellor must stand in. We have to send a clear message to the sector about the all-embracing scope of this new regime. There are those in claims management companies and solicitors who want to see high standards set and therefore will welcome such a commitment. Those who do not want exacting requirements will move on; and no one will be sorry to see them go. The most obvious gap in time, however, is at the beginning. I would welcome clarification from the Minister on how soon after commencement she and her hard-working officials envisage that a regulator will be designated and his or her powers set up. I do not just mean after commencement, I really mean now, because the sorts of situations I have been describing are happening out there and vulnerable people are being targeted.
</p>

<a name="60116-33_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>In Amendment No. 67A we have sought to tie in the transitional provisions which are referred to in a number of places, but in noticeably vague terms. I feel strongly that this is all about sending the right messages from the outset. Those in this sector who are not trying to meet reasonable standards need to understand that there is no further period of grace. There is no more &quot;last chance saloon&quot;. The last chance was stated very clearly by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor over a year ago. Too many are operating in this market for short-term gain. Another 12 months grace will, I am sure, suit their purposes very nicely indeed. I really want to hear from the Minister that their time is up. I beg to move.

<a name="60116-34_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for, as always, opening our discussions by setting out the nature and seriousness of the issues. As we go through this afternoon, it is my intention to reassure the noble Lord that I share his desire to ensure that we have no loopholes in the legislation. I agree with the noble Lord that we would seek to put things in the Bill where appropriate. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC145"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC145</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We recognise the advantages of secondary legislation, a matter which we have already discussed in Committee, in allowing us the flexibility to tackle other areas that may arise with greater speed than primary legislations allows. I hope that in that context I will be able to make these things clear to the Committee.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>I agree with what the noble Lord said about time being up. It is very important that those involved in this area understand precisely what we are doing. Although the speed at which we wish to move is tempered a little by the process of legislation, none the less, we intend to get this done as quickly as possible. I shall say a little more about that in a moment.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The noble Lord was particularly concerned about the issue of mis-sold endowment policies. I know that he has been keen to ensure that we address those issues as soon as possible. The noble Lord kindly shared with me the correspondence he had with the Financial Services Authority. As he will know, its chief executive indicated that extending the remit of the FSA would require at least secondary, and possibly primary, legislation. I mention that at this point because I went to see my honourable friend Mr Ivan Lewis, who is a Treasury Minister, to have a discussion on the issue. I have extended an invitation to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and I think that we have a meeting next week with the Treasury to discuss these issues again. I hope that that will, at least in part, demonstrate the seriousness with which we take these issues and that we recognise that the noble Lord is absolutely right to push hard on these questions to ensure that we deal with them as quickly as possible.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Part of demonstrating how we are seeking to do this as quickly as possible is that we have not waited for the legal services reform issues to be addressed in future legislation; rather we have brought forward this Bill now. But I am conscious that in order to ensure that we have effective regulation, we must put in place the right structures. This means that we need the code of practice and rules of conduct. We also need to work closely with the reputable industry and other stakeholders who are directly affected to ensure that we have it right. In other words, the people we are authorising need to know, as it were, what the rules of the game are going to be. Proper enforcement procedures therefore need to be in place, thus enabling us to act properly.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Before regulation can commence, we will need to produce the secondary legislation, including the order that will determine which sectors are to be regulated, but we shall not wait for Royal Assent before starting on this important work. We have already begun on the process of consultation required under Clause 11(3). I have already indicated that the secondary legislation will give us an opportunity to deal with other issues that may arise from time to time, bringing those sectors quickly into the regulatory net.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>We will also commence work on the regulations that are to underpin the Bill. While I do not have the exact timings, as those are made ready and become available, I plan to share drafts with the noble Lords, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC146"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC146</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Hunt and Lord Goodhart, and the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, as well as other noble Lords who have participated in our discussions. We shall begin work on the regulations required under the schedule, including consultation on the rules and codes of practice. We need to set up a procedure for the grant of authorisations and to establish a mechanism for dealing with complaints, as well as proper arrangements for enforcement against both authorised and unauthorised persons. Without effective enforcement, the regulation will be worthless.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>We also need to put in place regulations to establish the process of authorising those persons providing claims management services. We want to ensure that only those who meet the criteria for authorisation and agree to comply with the rules and the codes should be approved. That must be done quickly, but with due care and attention.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>On 20 December last I indicated in Grand Committee that I expected to receive advice on the issues of regulation from the independent expert before Christmas. I have indeed received a detailed report on which I have had an opportunity to speak briefly with the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Goodhart. I have sent a copy of the report to the Claims Standards Council asking for a formal response to the findings. At the time I also said that I would make available as much of the report as possible. I shall be doing that very shortly, but only after I have had the Claims Standards Council&#039;s response. I expect this to be ready before we reach the Report stage. At that point noble Lords will have an opportunity to discuss in greater detail the Government&#039;s firmer proposals on how we plan to take forward this regulation.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I am very happy to accept Amendment No. 51, the only caveat being that the drafting works properly. I have not yet checked it with parliamentary counsel. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will not mind if that is done, but I have no difficulty in accepting all the noble Lord has said about the value of the may/shall debates that we have had so often when considering legislation. However, I take the point being made here.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 67A, the provision in Clause 7(3) is intended to allow regulations to cover, if necessary, complaints from consumers which relate to events that took place before the commencement of the Act. If the Secretary of State were to regulate directly prior to the designation of a regulator, I understand that any necessary transitional provisions could be made under Clause 11(1)(c). I have already mentioned the report from Mr Boleat and it is our intention to delegate a person as the frontline regulator and for the Secretary of State, my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, to have oversight responsibility. That is our starting position and remains so at the moment. However, if we are unable to designate a body, the Secretary of State will then be required to regulate. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has already pointed out, that is implicit in Amendment No. 51, which as I have said I am happy to accept.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC147"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC147</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>In order to bring the noble Lord up to date, as he requested, perhaps I may point out that during the development of the Bill we consulted with a wide range of organisations from the legal, insurance and consumer fields about the sectors that should be subject to regulation. This includes the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, the Association of British Insurers, the Law Society, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, employment tribunals and the Local Government Association.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>We have extended the remit of the Consumer Panel, which was established to advise on legal services reform, to include the regulation of claims management services. Members of the Committee may be interested to learn that the organisations represented on the panel include the Federation of Small Businesses, Which?, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, the National Consumer Council and the Office of Fair Trading. We plan to involve the panel in the development of the order.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>I accept the principle that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, seeks to establish: that we need to act with speed but be ready for Royal Assent and not wait beyond that. Hence, we sought to consult early in the process and to have the draft regulations ready as soon as possible during the passage of the Bill through this House and another place. I hope that I have at least in part assured the noble Lord that I entirely support his sentiment and that he is therefore able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60116-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I greatly welcome the Minister&#039;s positive response, but I want to press her on one or two points. In a later debate, we will be dealing with the concern relating to endowment claims farmers, so perhaps I may reserve my comments on that until them. I welcome the commitment that the Minister made on her wish to consult immediately and she specified Clause 11(3). It would be helpful to reflect on the timing of that, although I know that one cannot anticipate the proceedings in another place. A clear message would be sent to everyone operating in this sector if we were able to obtain a commitment on when this year the Minister hopes some of the statutory regulation will begin to bite.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Secondly, there is undoubtedly a need for immediate action in a number of key areas. Several of us have raised the key issue of the transparency of the relationship between a claimant and the claims management company. It would be right that, whatever the transaction, the individual should be open with the claimant about the exact cost, whether loans are being spoken about and whether insurance is referred to. The vulnerable person has a right to know exactly what is being done. I declare an interest as the immediate former chairman of the Association of Independent Financial Advisers, who are regulated by Financial Services Authority. It is necessary, in the first discussion with the individual you are seeking to advise, to set out clearly and exactly the menu of charges. As I understand it, that does not apply because no advice is being given on financial products, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC148"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC148</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but advice is being given on how to claim. I do not know the extent to which we can hope to persuade the Minister, but certain basic principles should appear in the Bill which will come into effect immediately, and this is one of those.
</p>

<a name="60116-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>I want to ensure that when selling claims management services, there should be a requirement on that organisation or person to ensure that whatever happens, the individual vulnerable person knows what sort of contract he is entering into and what the obligations and eventual cost will be. The whole ethos of &quot;no win, no fee&quot; gives one impression, but the actuality is very different, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has pointed out on several occasions. Perhaps I may press the noble Baroness further on those two points.

<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60116-35_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I could not agree more with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, on transparency of cost being critical for the most vulnerable people who are approached in that way and who need to know precisely what they are letting themselves in for, if I may put it has bluntly as that. In some of our discussions later this afternoon, we will consider what should be in the Bill. It is important that we consider what should be in primary legislation, what should be in regulation, what should be in the rules and what should be in the code of practice. I am not at all against a discussion on what should be in a Bill, but I am not naturally a person who likes lists in the Bill. I am always worried that that gives weight to some issues but not to others that may deserve equal weight. I am keen that by the time the legislation is finished, people are absolutely certain that all those issues will be appropriately covered. That is clearly one of them.
</p>

<a name="60116-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>On timing, I said at Second Reading that we were looking to have everything done and dusted and the regulator ready, if we could, by the end of this year. I should like to do that more quickly if I possibly can. My personal ambition is to have everything ready by October. That is a personal ambition at this stage, but it is in recognition of the points made consistently by noble Lords about the need to move as swiftly as we possibly can. We plan, once the Bill leaves your Lordships&#039; House, to get it to another place as soon as we can and, as I said, to have the other processes moving alongside that so that, when we reach Royal Assent, we can move swiftly from then on. As I said, I shall say more about how we plan to develop the regulator&#039;s role during future debates on the Bill in Committee and on Report. I hope that that gives the noble Lord some answer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60116-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   What can I say? I asked the noble Baroness to give me assurances and she immediately did so. The Committee may have noticed that I refrained&#151;at least I hope that I did&#151;from using the word &quot;lists&quot;, because I recall that the last time that I used such a word the noble Baroness noticeably recoiled. I was not really asking for lists as such, but <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC149"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC149</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

certain key provisions that could come into immediate effect and, I think, do a great deal to protect people who need protecting.
</p>

<a name="60116-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>On timing, I am greatly encouraged by the noble Baroness&#039;s mention of the month of October, because I think that she said that the regulator could be in place by then, as well as all the regulations and everything else. I am sure that I speak for the whole Committee when I say that we greatly welcome that assurance. I know that it was surrounded by the necessary qualifications, which, if the noble Baroness had not inserted them, would have been put in for her by those who have to administer the provisions. I pay tribute to the very open way in which all of the noble Baroness&#039;s colleagues have tried to confront the problems here in as rapid a way as possible to provide the solution that we all seek.
</p>

<a name="60116-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I need say nothing more except to thank the noble Baroness and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60116-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60116-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 28:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>Page 2, line 4, after second &quot;services&quot; insert &quot;provided to persons resident in England or Wales&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is an attempt to address the problem of services being provided to people in England and Wales by claims management companies operating from outside the United Kingdom. Under the amendment, the Bill would read at page 2, line 4:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;&#039;claims management services&#039; means advice or other services provided to persons resident in England and Wales in relation to the making of a claim&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<a name="60116-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>We anticipate that one of the consequences of what the Minister and the Government are doing will be to drive some of the people that we really want regulated into jurisdictions where they feel that they will not be subjected to such a severe regime. That may already be happening, of course, as claims management companies attempt to avoid regulation. I would be very interested to hear from the Minister what is currently happening in the European Union, because Article 60 of the Treaty of Rome provides that services may be provided in another member state on a temporary basis on the same terms as provided in their own member state&#151;the &quot;country of origin&quot; principle. It applies to cross-border transactions when there is no move to establish a working base in the other member state. The provider of services will be regulated in those member states where they have &quot;established&quot; and not in a state where they simply provide temporary services on a remote basis.
</p>

<a name="60116-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The proposed directive on services will cover both legal and fiscal advice in situations where service is provided at a distance via the telephone and/or Internet services. So claims management services would be included. The directive seeks to promote a common standard for all types of service, rather than limited harmonisation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC150"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC150</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60116-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Directives have so far covered areas as diverse as postal services and professional qualifications. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 specifically extends jurisdiction to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. I would welcome the Minister&#039;s advice on whether that might be possible here. The Bill does not extend to Scotland. Will we see claims farmers simply resorting to hill farming or such like? I flag all this simply to make the point that if a claims management company in another member state is providing services in England and Wales, there is likely to be an obstacle to effective regulation in this country. If we can spot this loophole, I am sure that the claims management companies will already have done so.
</p>

<a name="60116-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>So the intention behind the amendment is to seek reassurance that the Government have considered the impact that the provision of cross-border services may have. It is essential that the new framework does everything possible to catch all those who seek to sell services to people in this country.
</p>

<a name="60116-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I understand that the Claims Standards Council has flagged on its website the problem of companies and individuals already operating from bases in Fuengirola and South Africa and therefore outside the control of the Advertising Standards Authority. So we are dealing with an industry that has a history of avoidance&#151;indeed, evasion&#151;and we cannot tolerate such a glaring loophole if it can possibly be closed. We would be interested to know how the Advertising Standards Authority has responded in the case of those who are extending their activities from Fuengirola and South Africa. As the adverts are being introduced in England and Wales, can it not regulate on that basis? If it cannot, there is a problem that ought to be dealt with. Does the Advertising Standards Authority have a dialogue going on with the Internet service providers? It would be interesting to know what is happening about all this. Do we already have this problem, and, if so, should not the Bill address the standards that will apply to advertising in this industry, wherever those claims management services are based, albeit temporarily, which are targeted at individuals?
</p>

<a name="60116-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The Committee will be aware that we receive e-mails from all over the world and we cannot tell where they are coming from. Many purport to come from Nigeria, but I understand that they do not. You cannot track down from where unsolicited e-mails are coming. There is a problem of enforcement as well as of jurisdiction. So I hope that the noble Baroness understands that I do not underestimate the difficulties. She may well say that there is only so much that the Government can do to tackle those who are determined to find a way round the system and have enormous ingenuity to enable them to do so, but I hope that she will understand that I am reluctant to ignore that key point.
</p>

<a name="60116-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>If we can, I want us to send the right message about the effect of the Bill to ensure that there will be no hiding place. In earlier contributions, I have already given an overall impression of the industry. It strikes <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC151"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC151</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

me as one that will try to find a way through even before the regulation is in place. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s response and I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60116-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I have a great deal of sympathy with the principle behind the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral. However, I think that its drafting has gone astray somewhere, because what identifies something that ought to be under the control of the legislation is not the residence of the client but the location where the claim would be litigated. The amendment would exclude some people who ought to be protected&#151;for instance, a foreigner who, on a holiday visit to England, suffers injury as a result of the alleged negligence of an English local authority. On the other hand, it would cover those who probably ought not to be covered, such as someone who is resident in England but pursues a claim which, if it has to be litigated, would be litigated in a different country.
</p>

<a name="60116-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>However, I see the point and I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to assure us that the Bill can be used against those who are resident in Fuengirola or South Africa and are trying to make money out of claims based in this country.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60116-36.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60116-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I am very grateful to the noble Lord. This is a rough and ready mechanism because, whatever words are chosen, some will be excluded. On reflection, perhaps a much wider wording might be better, so that we catch those whom we wish to catch and do not exclude that we have no wish to exclude.
</p>

<a name="60116-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>It may be helpful to the Minister if I quote from the policy director of the Claims Standards Council, Mr   Andy Wigmore, who said about those claims management companies:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;If they do their marketing offshore, then there is nothing that can stop them from breaking rules that would be applicable in the UK on acceptable advertising&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>So it would be really helpful if the noble Baroness could concentrate on the point about advertising.
</p>

<a name="60116-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Mr Wigmore continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;When they then pass compensation claims onto UK intermediaries, they are not breaking any laws, but it will make regulation harder to enforce. There is a big call centre in Fuengirola that these companies are using . . . These places are where a lot of spam e-mails and cold-calling phone calls originate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>So we are dealing with an actual problem in two specific places, but there may well be others.
<a name="time_2"></a>
<a name="60116-36_time0"></a><h5>4.15 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60116-36_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, mentioned the name of the town because it saves me having to pronounce it. I understand that it is on the Costa del Sol in Spain. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is right to point out that it is Fuengirola. I have also looked at the comments of Mr Andy Wigmore of the Claims Standards Council. I shall address this issue in three ways.
</p>

<a name="60116-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, indicated, there are circumstances where a claims management company operating offshore but providing services to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC152"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC152</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consumers in England and Wales would come within the jurisdiction of English law and our courts. The company could be prosecuted under this legislation and requires the service provider to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the English courts, either voluntarily&#151;which may or may not happen&#151;or by the process of extradition. The Committee knows well that for extradition to apply, a similar offence must be in place in the other country. Therefore, the offences under Clauses 5 and 9 would fulfil the requirement for England and Wales, but the same acts may not be similarly punishable under the laws of the country from which extradition is requested. I recognise the limitations and I admit that there are limits to what we can do on some of these issues.
</p>

<a name="60116-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>However, there are two further critical aspects to enable us to deal effectively with these matters. The first is the vital importance of providing information to the consumer and the requirements that we might place on the legal practices involved in this in terms of those they deal with. Consumers must be made aware of the new regulation. This may be by a process of kitemarking, but we have yet to determine that. However, I am absolutely certain that consumers must be given every confidence in the procedure. Part of that is ensuring that they understand by one means or another who is reputable and who is not. That may be done by naming and shaming, by publishing lists or by issuing kitemarks. That is a critical point because consumers are protected only as far as they are provided with information. That also applies to the legal firms involved in the process. I could not agree more with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that we shall need to look at this area with great care. We must do all we can to ensure that those operating offshore disreputably cannot do so.
</p>

<a name="60116-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I turn now to the European Union and the services directive. The noble Lord will know that the directive is currently being redrafted. It is worth making the point that during the initial drafting we asked for private international law to be carved out of the directive so that we could deal with the questions of reciprocity and other cross-border concerns. Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, pointed out, that would apply in both directions. For example, if a scaffolding company from another country working here injured a passer-by, at present the claim would be made in the British courts, but using the law of the home country of the scaffolding company. The basis of the services directive process is the country of origin.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>We think that we can do better than that. During our presidency I spent many months negotiating a definition of the term &quot;cross-border&quot; in order to ensure that the ability to make small claims is more readily available to individuals across the European Union in simple and practical ways, and I am keen to continue with that work. I propose to discuss this with colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry, the lead department in the area. However, Mr Robert Madeleine, who is in charge of the EU competitiveness and internal market directorate, will be able to provide me with practical advice on our approach to the new <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60116-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I have not addressed issues relating to the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands because I do not have enough information to do so effectively. If I may, I shall write specifically to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, on what can be done in those areas. However, I hope that on the basis of what I have said he will feel that we have the measure of the issues and can take various actions to address the problem in a different way.

<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60116-36_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   I support some of the Minister&#039;s remarks. We might be in danger of taking the consumer for granted as always being vulnerable. However, some consumers are less vulnerable than others. Indeed, some consumers are good at promoting claims and if they do not receive a satisfactory response from the first person they approach, they go to a second and even a third. Therefore, I urge that we do not shut every loophole, although my noble friend Lord Hunt likes to do so. We should never succeed in that and I feel strongly that it would be better to rely on a combination of guidance, as the Minister described. Guidelines are important.
</p>

<a name="60116-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>There was a good article in the <i>Financial Times&#151;</i>I know that not the most vulnerable people read that&#151;pointing out all the traps one can fall into if one goes to the wrong person to pursue a claim. I would prefer to be as precise as possible on a relatively narrow ground, if I followed the argument made about Fuengirola. With modern means of communication and with people authorised to manage claims not always being as good as they should be and behaving as well as they should do, we would be better advised to narrow it down.
</p>

<a name="60116-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>That leads me on to the secondary legislation point, also raised by my noble friend. The Better Regulation Task Force dealt not only with this subject but produced a report called <i>Regulation&#151;Less is More</i>. The Government have been encouraging us all to have less secondary legislation, particularly for business. However, as regards this Bill, unless we see drafts of secondary legislation before it reaches Third Reading, we do not know what will be done. I am therefore concerned to introduce more precision. At Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, used the word &quot;premature&quot;. I am not sure of the exact context in which he did so, but I think he said that the Bill might be somewhat premature. I remember agreeing with that comment. My plea is that we should not go on an extended loophole exercise, but should be more precise about a narrower measure that will work. We could always then apply the good lessons in another area later.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60116-36_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I thank the noble Viscount for that intervention. To a large degree, I agree it is important to be precise and I have indicated that we will bring forward the regulations. However, I hope that during our discussions, what we seek to do will be clear. The advantage of secondary legislation, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC154"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC154</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as I have indicated, is that we can also take areas out of regulation when it is clear that there are no issues to be addressed. The noble Viscount at that moment smiled wryly and I can understand that he is looking for evidence of when that has happened. However, one of the ambitions of this legislation is that when issues no longer exist we shall be able to remove them.
</p>

<a name="60116-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I also rose to my feet because I realised that I had not answered the point that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, raised about the Advertising Standards Authority, for which I apologise. I put the piece of paper down too quickly. We have undertaken with the authority research into precisely what is happening in advertising. I think I indicated to the Committee previously that I had considered all the advertising on television and its range. We have asked the authority to consider whether it believes there is any need for it to do anything further on that. As I said, that research has already been funded. The noble Lord raised the important issue of Internet services. I shall take that away and ensure that it is been covered within the research that is being undertaken. I will, of course, report the outcome of that research as soon as I am able. We hope that it will inform us properly what more, if anything, should be done.

<a name="60116-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I agree with my noble friend Lord Eccles that we have to be targeted and focused&#151;those are the two relevant verbs. We need to target and to focus the legislation in areas where it can have most effect. I also agree with my noble friend that there are different sorts of consumers here. We must try to bear that in mind. I do not in any way draw back from my commitment to ensure that when the legislation leaves our House it should be phrased in a way that will have a meaningful impact on some of the worst excesses of claims management companies. However, I agree with my noble friend that we should not try to do everything. We should not seek to over-protect. I almost split my infinitives, but I believe that that term is recognised. We have a lot to learn from my noble friend&#039;s wise words.

</p>

<a name="60116-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I turn to the noble Baroness&#039;s comments on Europe. From my discussions with the competition directorate I am aware that there is a very good close working relationship between the internal market commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, and the competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes. I am greatly heartened by that. I have met the key players. I am aware that in Europe there is considerable concern about what is called the &quot;trans-Atlantic disease&quot;; that is, the excesses of the American system, which have now become so absurd that they merited a whole section in the State of the Union address by the President, when he said that they must ensure that tort lawyers do not undermine the growth in the US economy. I believe that there are serious problems in the United States in that regard. The message I got from the competition and internal market directorates was that they were a little concerned that things were happening in the UK which might come across the Channel, having already crossed the pond.
</p>

<a name="60116-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>I would like reassurance that the noble Baroness will not allow anything like that to occur in the United Kingdom. In other countries in the European Union <br>&nbsp;<br>

there is not the worry about the compensation culture that there is here. The perception of a compensation culture is not really to be found in most of the rest of the European Union, so the commissioners have a right to expect us to take steps to ensure that it does not gain any strength. I am not aware of any steps that the European Commission is taking to tackle the compensation culture, but it would be very helpful for the Committee if the noble Baroness could keep it in touch with any developments that may take place in the discussions between her officials and those two key directorates.

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>On the second area of advertising, I greatly welcome the Minister&#039;s reassurance about what she intends to do now to take this further. One of the key problems with advertising is that although my noble friend is right that we must not seek to overprotect, there is undoubtedly something rather unsavoury about an advertisement to make a claim against your doctor, or a nurse, or a hospital, from an organisation that forges, in effect, the NHS logo onto its advertising material and has an ambulance outside the accident and emergency department urging people who may have a claim to make one. Is it really necessary to include in advertising the merits of a claims management company that the benefits of making a successful claim could be,

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>There is something unsavoury about that, and I hope that the discussions that will take place between the Minister and her colleagues will focus on trying to tighten up this whole area. I agree with many of the comments that were made. On that basis, I await developments.
</p>

<a name="60116-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>We are about to embark on a rather truncated timetable. I imagine that Report will follow in the next month, and the Minister has been promising amendments on Report. We are hoping very much indeed to see draft regulations, a draft code of practice or draft consultations. It sounds to me as if the next two weeks will be hugely busy. I say to the Minister that she should feel free to share some of those documents at an earlier stage than might otherwise come to mind, because it would be enormously helpful to Members of this Committee who have been scrutinising this legislation so carefully to see some of that material a week or two before we debate it.

I make no apology for trying to get this Bill on the statute book as quickly as possible to address the concerns that we have, hence trying to get a lot of this work done in parallel and hence wishing to keep noble Lords informed.

</p>

<a name="60116-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I have met Neelie Kroes, and I am very impressed with her. We have invited her to visit us here to discuss a number of issues, not least liberalisation in legal services, as she is very interested in what we have been doing in the UK on that. We will be able to pick up those points with her. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that this issue has not been picked up by the European Union. That is why I was keen to talk to my international officials about ways in which, particularly around the services directive, we might be able to look at this question so that it does not translate across into other parts of the European Union. We recognise the increasing development of operation between us and other European states on a whole range of things to do with civil law. That is a critical part of it. Under the Finnish presidency, which begins in July, we will also have a review of the Hague programme, which is an opportunity to look at all the civil law provisions that were agreed under the Dutch presidency to see whether they are operating effectively and whether we need to look at particular issues. I have already begun discussions with my Finnish counterparts over the weekend at the last Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting.
</p>

<a name="60116-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The issue about the ambulance outside the accident and emergency unit is important. One of the underlying issues in all of this work is about people&#039;s interpretation of the credibility that those organisations or individuals have, because they link themselves in some vague or non-vague way with the public sector. In other words, if you are in, say, a hospital, a police station or a school, you might believe that credibility is being given to the operation of individuals or organisations. We must look seriously at that because a false impression might be given to people at their most vulnerable point and we need to avoid that at all costs.

</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>The noble Lord said: It may be convenient if I speak also to Amendment No. 30. Amendment No. 29 sharpens the definition. We want to ensure that the definition of &quot;claim&quot; extends to complaints about financial products because we did not think it was clear that it did so. The difficulties may be that such claims are hybrid as between negligence and breach of contract because many claims will lie in negligent misrepresentation. The intention of Amendment No. 29 is simply to flag our concern to ensure that the wording covers what it is intended to cover.

</p>

<a name="60116-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I want to concentrate in particular on Amendment No. 30, which is a simple request for clarification. The phrase &quot;in pursuance of a voluntary undertaking&quot; has no obvious meaning in this context. I looked through the Explanatory Notes and could not find clarification. The amendment would leave out subsection (2) (iii) on page 2. It is possible that it is intended to cover claims against the various ombudsman schemes&#151;the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Housing Ombudsman Service&#151;particularly those where organisations not strictly covered by the statutory scheme have agreed to be bound by it.
</p>

<a name="60116-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>The Financial Ombudsman Service was set up by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. It states in its aims and values that it is neither a consumer champion nor a trade body: it is completely independent and deals with all disputes fairly and impartially. No one should need special expertise or professional help to use the service and bring a complaint to it. That should be part and parcel of the service provided. The Housing Ombudsman Service, set up under the Housing Act 1996, is for all residents in homes managed by a provider of housing services registered with the Housing Ombudsman Service. All social landlords, housing associations, registered in England are included, as are certain private landlords and management agents.
</p>

<a name="60116-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>From the consumers&#039; point of view, those services can be used without the need for professional help. Most importantly, they are free, fair and independent. I would like clarification from the Minister about the extent to which she has been able to consult the various ombudsmen about the proposal or about the problem with claims management companies generally. It would be interesting if the Minister would share with us the extent to which consultations have taken place, are taking place or will take place with the various ombudsmen. It is important that they see their place and their independent role in no way being affected by this important legislation. In later debates, I shall return to specific instances but that is the context in which I beg to move the amendment.

<a name="60116-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I say immediately to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that we are looking to consult the various ombudsmen. We are very aware of the role of the Housing Ombudsman Service. We are talking to the British and Irish Ombudsman Association and individual ombudsmen about the particular regulations. The noble Lord will appreciate that that is being done by my officials, and I cannot give the detail at this stage because I have not yet had a report back, but I can reassure him that it is happening. If the noble Lord would like, I could write to him with the results of those deliberations to see that they are involved, but I can categorically state that they are, indeed, involved in what we are seeking to do.
</p>

<a name="60116-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>I have looked carefully at the construction by parliamentary counsel of the definition in Clause 2 to ensure that we were not in danger of failing to capture all the claims services. The way that the clause is constructed is to allow provisions to be dependent on each other, so the clause in its entirety seeks to bring all the claims management services within scope, but regulation will apply only to those specified in the order that we have made under Clause 2(2)(e). In other words, we start very broad and we narrow it down, using the regulations in that way. We felt that was a better approach, because it enables us, through regulation, to add later if it were appropriate to capture other areas where we felt it was important to regulate; as we would have done had we had this legislation in place before endowment mis-selling came to our attention. We are convinced that the way that the clause is constructed does achieve what the noble Lord is seeking. It achieves it in a particular way, and we have confirmed that with parliamentary counsel.
</p>

<a name="60116-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The noble Lord asked about voluntary undertaking under Amendment No. 30. &quot;Undertaking&quot; in this context effectively means a promise, and we have included it to ensure that those less formal <i>ex gratia</i> payment schemes are covered. The obvious one is that which insurance companies have to compensate their customers for mis-sold endowment policies. That is exactly what the idea of voluntary undertaking in the legislation seeks to do. We felt that was an important element to include in the Bill, because we want to make sure that the issue of mis-sold endowment policies is captured in the legislation. I have heard from parliamentary counsel that that is what that seeks to do.
</p>

<a name="60116-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>Although I have given a relatively brief contribution, I am at one with what the noble Lord seeks to do. The way that we have framed Clause 2 captures it in that way, and I hope that I have given an explanation of what &quot;voluntary undertaking&quot; means, but I am happy to write to the noble Lord if he would like further clarification from parliamentary counsel, who would be delighted to give it.

&quot;(   )   for the avoidance of doubt, &quot;claim&quot; includes a claim against a landlord for breach of an implied covenant in respect of the repair of a dwelling-house under section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (c. 70) (repairing obligations in short leases),&quot;

<p><a name="st_25"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to highlight another example of the way in which claims farmers deflect the funding of public services; usually, sadly, solely for their own benefit. The amendment deals with the duty under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 to keep housing in good repair. That has become another fruitful area for a number of unscrupulous claims management companies, where tenants are encouraged to claim for defects, often of a modest nature, in their property.
<a name="time_4"></a>
<a name="60116-38_time0"></a><h5>4.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60116-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The lure of extra cash is far stronger than the idea of better quality housing and so tenants who have not contacted their landlord to get problems fixed none the less bring claims whose proceeds go first to the claims management company. The tenant will no doubt be tempted to spend the balance they receive on other things and often the advertising will urge them to do so. The net result is that the housing stock is not improved.
</p>

<a name="60116-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>It is another arena in which free services are available to assist those who have complaints. Those with complaints against social landlords can go to the Housing Ombudsman Service, or the Local Government Ombudsman if they are council tenants. If they do so, the service offers mediation and other services under the banner of alternative dispute resolution and offers a conciliatory and, more importantly, free service. For instance, Hackney Council announced a new independent arbitration service which it estimates should save the council up to &#163;1 million a year and avoid lengthy court disputes for tenants. I warmly applaud that action and understand that a number of other local authorities are seeking to save considerable sums of taxpayers&#039; money through such a new arbitration service. Alternative dispute resolution is the answer to this problem and the free services that are available should in no way be usurped by claims management companies seeking to extract benefit for themselves out of a situation that can be resolved comparatively easily.
</p>

<a name="60116-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>As regards previous court decisions, I want to refer only to one: that is, <i>Bowen </i>v <i>Bridgend County Borough Council</i> in 2004 in which the judiciary rightly condemned the advice given to the claimant. The claims management company sought to prevent the claimant receiving a free service, benefiting from the claimant being tempted to use its fee-paying service on the basis that the fee would not be paid by the individual claimant but would be recovered as part of the claim. That case highlights the fact that at the outset claims management companies are not advising the claimants of the availability of other forms of funding or of a free service. Instead, they are trying to persuade them to enter into conditional fee <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC160"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC160</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

agreements, after-the-event insurance agreements and even to take out loans to fund disbursements. The court found that the claimant had not necessarily got a better service or a swifter solution to his problems by using the claims management company&#039;s scheme. They would have done far better to use one of the alternatives, which were never explained to them at the outset. The judiciary were most critical of that.


</p>

<a name="60116-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The ombudsman service, as I have already mentioned, is there to offer a free service that allows people to sort out their housing problems. It addresses the problem rather than creating a new one or a profit stream for companies entering this arena. In that case, the costs judge noted that in the 11 cases that he was considering, the average damages recovered was &#163;1,631. It seems that the real problem in housing disrepair cases is that the small claims limit of &#163;1,000 helps no one in resolving these disputes other than claims management companies. Local authorities need to spend money on housing repairs, but they are hampered in their efforts to do so by having to pay out legal and other costs, and the bill falls on the local authority and the council tax payer.
</p>

<a name="60116-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>This may be an opportunity for the Minister to share with us the Government&#039;s intention about the small claims limit in the context of personal injury claims, but also other claims. The general view expressed to me on all sides is that the limit remains far too low. The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee, before its present inquiry, recommended an increase for personal injury claims from &#163;1,000 to &#163;2,500. Whether or not one agrees that that is sufficient, the need for change appears to be established. The Association of British Insurers has recently pointed out that an increase to &#163;2,500 does not even cover inflation, since the limit was last changed in 1991.
</p>

<a name="60116-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>There are a number of examples of smaller claims having far too much in addition in costs. I also looked, when I was surfing the Internet, at a marvellously-named company called Claim 2 Gain. It was advertising a specialist claims service for victims of endowment mis-selling. It says that it is experienced in compliance, and, referring to that level of experience, continues on its website:

</p>

<a name="60116-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>My point about all such claims is that where there is a free service, as per the Financial Ombudsman Service, set up by law as an independent public body, its job is to resolve individual disputes between consumers and financial services firms. I have two points to make. First, I do not like the idea of claims management companies trying to pretend that they have expertise greater than the free service, whether it is the Housing Ombudsman Service or the Financial Ombudsman Service. We must find some way of getting through to the public that the free service is available. Secondly, while the small claims limit remains so low, it is catching into a whole range of claims that should not be there in any event, because they should be subject to alternative dispute <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60116-39_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for explaining what is behind the amendment. I will focus my remarks on the two points that the noble Lord is most interested in. I was heartened by his comments about free services. One issue that we have to grapple with in the ministerial group is to make sure that people get information about the free services available to them and to make sure that is promoted and advertised as much as possible.
</p>

<a name="60116-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>As I recall, an issue was raised in the correspondence between the Financial Services Authority and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt; forgive me if I have that wrong. The issue is whether by advertising their services, sometimes claims management companies raise the fact that there is an issue that people can make a claim against. The letter muses on whether that in itself is an interesting service. I agree with the noble Lord that the critical issue is that individuals need to know the options available to them and can make their choices accordingly. It may be that they wish to pay for what they consider to be a superior or better service. As the noble Lord indicated, there is not much evidence at this stage to suggest that that is what they are getting; they are getting a service, but they might have got just as good a service for free.
</p>

<a name="60116-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>I also agree on alternative dispute resolution; I am responsible for that in the Department for Constitutional Affairs. A lot of work is going into trying to offer opportunities for individuals who have some form of dispute not to end up in the court system, where it would be better for all concerned and often a much easier and happier way to find solutions to resolve it outside the court. We are doing work all over the country to develop different initiatives to achieve that where we possibly can. There is a lot of agreement between us on that, and we need to look more carefully at that.
</p>

<a name="60116-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>On the small claims limit, I met with the Association of British Insurers the other day, and I note that it said, exactly as did the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that there is concern. We have begun to talk to a range of organisations, including consumer organisations, about that, and we will be formally consulting. I am waiting for my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor and I to have the opportunity to discuss precisely when would be the right moment to have that consultation, because, as the noble Lord said, there are a lot of views and a lot of voices on this from people who are interested in what we may do. They are not unanimous, of course, and we need to take different views into account. As soon as I have an answer to the specific question about when we might do that, I will notify the noble Lord and the Committee.
</p>

<a name="60116-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a> On the amendment, we want to include housing disrepair claims within the scope of regulation, as we have indicated, but including them by reference to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC162"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC162</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Clause 11 may not be enough to ensure that we capture all the claims that we want. We are looking to consult with the Local Government Association, the British Property Association and the Association of Residential Managing Agents to ensure that we get a definition that captures such claims as we want to. I hope that on that basis, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60116-39_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I am very grateful to the noble Baroness. It is interesting that there are differing views about the small claims limit. I must share with the Committee another result of my surfing the Internet. I came across an email from Lawyers 4 Justice. It is headed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;Thousands of Personal Injury Lawyers face the dole!&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>It continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;If we&#039;re not careful this could be a very real headline unless we Lawyers join forces and do something to protect ourselves NOW . . . Do you realise that if the DCA get their own way and raise the small claims limit . . . almost 80% of the personal injury market will disappear overnight. Not only that but there is talk of cutting lawyers out of the PI process altogether. Is this really access to justice? Discussions are going on behind closed doors right now and your future is being decided without your involvement. We can&#039;t keep sitting tight lipped and continue to let a few determine the futures of many. What are you doing to protect your own future?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>It is all systems go for lawyers, but not for justice. Not only is this stuff pretty unsubtle and rather distasteful, but it demonstrates that the noble Baroness may be about to become a Joan of Arc for the claimant.

</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60116-39_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   But it will not happen to the Minister. I recall that in New South Wales a similar reform to that which we are discussing was introduced by the government. The Premier told me at the time that the best thing that ever happened was to see all the profit-making lawyers and non-lawyers suddenly receiving redundancy notices, because they had never added anything to the process. They had added cost, often at the expense of the victim. For anyone to give any credence to this nonsense demonstrates that perhaps we have got the small claims limit slightly out of kilter, and I am sure that the noble Baroness would never respond to the absurd over-reaction. But it demonstrates that there are differing views&#151;some of which are understandable and some of which are incomprehensible. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60116-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60116-39_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 32:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>Page 2, line 14, leave out paragraph (e).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>The noble Lord said: It may be useful for the Committee if we consider Amendment No. 33 with Amendment No. 32, which would leave out paragraph (e) and insert&#151;I immediately see that I am not getting through to the noble Baroness&#151;a number of instances where the types of claims management services to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC163"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC163</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

regulated are set out. As presently drafted, Clause 2(2)(e) would give the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor power to prescribe what types of claims management services are to be regulated. Arguably, this clause is the root of the problem which the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and I raised earlier in debates on this Bill; namely, that delegated powers, as such, are not contained in very much detail. In particular, this clause could make the impact of the Bill much less wide-ranging than might otherwise be the case.
</p>

<a name="60116-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Omission of this paragraph would necessitate a number of consequential amendments to embody the principle that all claims management services should be assumed to be caught unless they are exempt, including, in particular, the definition of regulated claims management services under Clause 10. We would argue that all claims management services should be caught by the regulations, which would in many ways ensure a level playing field for all those who enter this sector, with no services outside the scope of the new regulations. That would seem to be very fair and would be focused and targeted in the way that my noble friend Lord Eccles referred to. We need to ensure that all those who need to be are affected by the new regulations.
</p>

<a name="60116-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>It would be good for the Minister to provide a more considered and detailed response to the concerns raised by the Delegated Powers Committee in its report. In response, I expect that the Minister will say that the flexibility that she will receive under the legislation is required to move urgently to deal as and when new abuses emerge in the brave new world that the Bill will usher in. Our position, however, is that we need the powers to extend to all areas in which there is evident abuse.
</p>

<a name="60116-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>An alternative to leaving out Clause 2(2)(e) would be to make a clear and unambiguous statement in the Bill regarding the scope of the services to be regulated, which explains Amendment No. 33. One possibility would be along the lines of that outlined by the noble Baroness at Second Reading, including scope for the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to extend the list through secondary legislation. In Amendment No. 33, I have sought to bring together the key areas that should be regulated. I have no doubt that the areas specified in Amendment No. 33 will remain active areas of activity for claims management companies for some time.
</p>

<a name="60116-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>However, our preference remains that all services should be covered, rather than setting out a list that would inevitably encourage claims management companies to find a gap or loophole to exploit. If the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor wants to limit his powers on initial implementation, he should do so in primary legislation. I am suggesting that as an alternative, and, in order to show her good offices, the Minister might graciously pass me across the Committee Floor the draft regulations which she proposes to lay. I suspect that she may not be able to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC164"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC164</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

do that at present, but it would be helpful if she could address the issue in responding to the amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60116-39_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I support Amendment No. 32. This Bill has had an exceptionally negative response from the Delegated Powers Committee, which is very concerned that it is in the nature of a skeleton Bill and that far too much is left to be spelt out by regulations. Clearly, this is one of those matters. The most simple and direct way of dealing with this would be to say that all claims management services are covered by the Bill.    Of course, there is power for exemptions, authorisations and so on, which could modify the direct effect of that. I would therefore like the Minister to say what the criteria will be for the services to be the subject of an order under paragraph (e) and those services which will not be made the subject of an order.

<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60116-40_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   I, too, support the general direction of the amendment. I notice that in the memorandum from the department there is a considerable overlap in the four categories listed in the reply to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee with my noble friend Lord Hunt&#039;s list. As regards new paragraph (e)(vi), I have a preference for being able to do something else later&#151;perhaps towards the end of the Bill. If another category of claims were to be brought in by statutory instrument, there would need to be a considerable period of time for consultation, representations and all the normal processes. It is not just a question of having a list and being free to add to it at any time without due care and attention. It might have been better if my noble friend Lord Hunt had placed that provision later in the Bill. Otherwise, I support the amendment because it gives focus and direction to the Bill.


</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60116-40_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to Members of the Committee for their attempts to look again at this area. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, will not be surprised if I begin by quoting the Delegated Powers Committee on this aspect. It stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;It is for the House to decide whether or not the definition in the bill of &#039;claims management services&#039; is appropriate but it seems to us acceptable for the bill to set the outer limits and for subordinate legislation to designate services within those limits. This is similar to a provision in section 22 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and would enable the Secretary of State to target areas which he considers are from time to time at a particularly high risk&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>That is exactly the approach that we have taken, which I interpret the Delegated Powers Committee to support. I have indicated to Members of the Committee that I plan to deal with all the other issues raised by the Delegated Powers Committee by amendments on Report, which I shall share with the Committee beforehand, in order to ensure that, as always, we fit in with what it has advised us to do.
</p>

<a name="60116-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>In this aspect, it is right that that is the approach that the Government have sought, which is to define the services and to narrow down in order to catch the services that we believe need to be dealt with where <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC165"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC165</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there is a risk to consumers, so defining wide and specifying by order. To accept the amendments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, would be to change the approach in a way that would not achieve what we want to do. As I have already indicated, it is an approach done through the Financial Services and Markets Act as well.
</p>

<a name="60116-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The noble Viscount raised a point on how long it would take to bring in new areas. We would say that it would take months and not years. One of the issues for the regulator is that we would be able, I hope, to gather intelligence in a way that would enable us to bring in any necessary regulation at an early stage. Of course, that is the indication of an effective regulator, which I think that the Committee would support, for dealing with inappropriate operations as quickly as possible.
</p>

<a name="60116-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>As I have indicated, we have set this out so that we can set the net wide but have the flexibility to ensure that we deal only with areas of risk. I reiterate that we would hope to remove areas as it was clear that they did not any longer need to be regulated. To be able to do that in both directions is an important aspect of better regulation. I do not know what else I can say to the Committee, other than that we believe that approach to be appropriate and that it will achieve what Members of the Committee want in an appropriate manner. I hope that, on consideration, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will feel that we will achieve what his amendment seeks to achieve, but in a more flexible way that might enable us to capture areas more efficiently and to deal with the difficulties that consumers face as effectively as possible.

<a name="60116-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and my noble friend Lord Eccles for their support. But I would like to press the Minister a little further. It would be helpful if she could indicate whether the draft regulations exist. The timescale is getting very tight. Next week we shall complete Committee stage. Already, we have been given indications that Report stage will follow reasonably soon thereafter. The noble Baroness has given a commitment, which I know she will honour, to share with us the draft regulations before Report stage.
</p>

<a name="60116-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>Could the noble Baroness give us an idea of how long these regulations are? How many pages are there? Do they exist? Will she accept that we would love to have a look at them? We will not necessarily expect them to be the final draft. We will expect, of course, there to be various points raised on the draft regulations. I am sure that I speak for the whole Committee in saying that the earlier we have an opportunity to have a look at them, the more that we will understand the Government&#039;s approach, be able to prepare for Report stage and be able to put down amendments, if necessary, for Report stage, after having seen the draft regulations. I hope that the noble Baroness understands that the timescale is getting concertinaed. It may be that the draft regulations will be the complete answer and that we will say, &quot;Fine. We are very happy. Let us now proceed as soon as possible&quot;. I would be very grateful if the noble Baroness could give us a little more idea of the timing that she has in mind.

I think that I said that, during the passage of the Bill, everything would be done to ensure that as soon as we have Royal Assent, we can move as swiftly as possible. I say that only because it is always my view that we should give your Lordships&#039; House as much information as possible, including sharing draft regulations, but I do not want to commit to something that I cannot deliver. That would be inappropriate. We cannot draft the regulations until we know what the enabling powers will be, so it is important that we have as much debate as possible in Committee.

I therefore presume that if she intends to meet all those concerns, it will be necessary for her to table some amendments on Report.
</p>

<a name="60116-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>I accept that the final regulations cannot be drafted until the enabling powers are clarified, but the Committee will not be dividing. I suppose that the Minister anticipates that she may make certain concessions that limit or extend the enabling powers, but she can rest assured that the Bill will emerge from Committee in exactly the same form as it entered&#151;unless she has a sudden run in which she accepts every amendment, but I do not detect that that is about to happen. She will understand that we are in entering a tight area in which we will finish Committee next week. We will then embark on Report. We have not yet received much detail about what amendments she intends to table on Report. We have not seen the regulations&#151;neither has she&#151;but she must have something in mind. If, at the earliest opportunity, she could share that with us, it would be so much easier for everyone.

I must also say that I am rather ambitious. I should like the Bill to emerge from Report, as well as Committee, in pretty much the shape that it is in now. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will aid and abet me in so doing.

<a name="60116-41_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   Before we leave this amendment, I keep reading the words from the 7th report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. They are pretty stern. The committee states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;In our opinion it is inappropriate that so many key features are here proposed to be left to delegated legislation&quot;.</p>

As my noble friend has pointed out, that is a rather worrying development, given that she has assured the Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform that she will meet all the points it has made. I am sure she will, but that will require some amendment to the Bill.

There is no difference between the noble Lord and I on the point. I apologise if I did not make it clear. It is my ambition to do that and, as I indicated at Second Reading, we take very seriously and have considered in detail all the issues that have been raised by the Delegated Powers Committee and we will address them appropriately.

</p>

<a name="60116-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>As regards legal services, the report of Sir David Clementi said about the demand for multi-disciplinary practices (MDPs) that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;in the context of claims arising out of motor accidents, MDPs could offer an integrated service which dealt with all the related issues, such as property damage (to the car), mobility (courtesy car), health, rehabilitation and compensation. Affinity groups, such as trade unions, also provide a range of services to their members, of which legal advice is one, but one that is sometimes closely connected with other needs such as employment and welfare issues&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>Sir David Clementi continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;The Consultation Paper . . . identified a number of issues with MDPs. These are:&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>(i) the issue of regulatory reach&#151;how could a legal services regulator exercise power over people who were not lawyers, were offering clients a different professional service and who might have different codes of practice in areas such as client handling;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>(ii) the additional problem of regulatory reach where there were more than two professions involved and no obvious lead regulator; this would include the problems of using the HOLP model where non-legal professionals are involved&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>I hope that by quoting the Clementi report I have given some substance to the problem of having a seamless robe of regulation over this whole area. Sir David Clementi concluded:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;The Regulator would, therefore, have to enter into collaborative arrangements with other regulators where this was deemed appropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>If Amendment No. 34 were accepted, Clause 2(3)(a)(ii) would read,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;the provision of services by way of or in relation to legal or other representation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>We do not want to legislate in such a way that the regulator, and possibly even the courts, get bogged down in a series of running arguments about the nature of services provided, and therefore the need to ensure real consumer protection by making sure that all services provided by claims management companies are caught by the regulation. That point is, however, raised against the background of the litigation concerning Claims Direct and The Accident Group schemes in which a number of services were branded as insurance services, and where the company tried to hide behind that branding to prevent the court considering whether they were, in fact, &quot;insurance services&quot;. In fact, several of the services were nothing of the kind but were claims handling services. The same argument will, no doubt, be tried here.
</p>

<a name="60116-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I recall that Master Hurst, in considering the Claims Direct test cases, was given details of these insurance services as: first, arranging for the completion of the Claims Direct application form; secondly, arranging for the completion of the credit agreement application form; thirdly, forwarding the Claims Direct application form to Claims Direct; fourthly, obtaining such other information as may be requested by the appointed representative; fifthly, obtaining witness statements; sixthly, monitoring the conduct of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

appointed representative and reporting on the same; seventhly, arranging for Claims Direct&#039;s client to attend at a medical appointment; eighthly, reviewing the appointed representative&#039;s bill of costs; and,   ninthly, maintaining the relevant financial information.
</p>

<a name="60116-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>Master Hurst examined each of these items and found that only items one, two, three, six and nine could properly be held to be insurance services. Items four, five, seven and eight were all claims handling services, not, as Claims Direct contended, insurance services. The importance of this for the purposes of the judgment was that only insurance services could properly form part of the insurance premium claimed, claims handling services could not. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will understand the reason for this amendment. The burden of proof should be shifted and all activities should be caught. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="60116-42_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising these issues. I completely agree with the principle behind the amendments which is, as the noble Lord indicated, that all claims companies providing regulated claims management services should be captured. I have already explained the way in which we have constructed Clause 2 and that there is a need to look at that clause in its entirety. I therefore say to the noble Lord at the outset that the definition in Clause 2 does exactly what he intends it to. Therefore, I submit that the amendments are unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="60116-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The wide definition within Clause 2 ensures that we are covering far more than those representations which are legal. I hope the noble Lord will understand that we capture what he seeks to capture. Clause 2 makes clear that &quot;claims management services&quot; means advice or other services in relation to the making of a claim. All of the areas that the noble Lord mentioned as being defined by Master Hurst would be covered by the legislation.
</p>

<a name="60116-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>We have ensured that we avoid any doubt by specifying that the provision of services could include the provision of services by way of and in relation to legal representation. That does not mean that other representation is excluded&#151;quite the contrary. The way that the words &quot;in particular&quot; work in legislation indicates that the list at Clause 2(3)(a) is not exhaustive. It is unnecessary to mention activities that would obviously fall within the provision of services. This includes representation that is not legal. We have confirmed this with parliamentary counsel who asked me to put on the record that&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will know far better than I&#151;there is a well understood principle of statutory drafting that you do not state the obvious on the face of legislation. The list at Clause 2(3) does not include other representation because it is obvious that would fall within the definition of &quot;claims management services&quot; at Clause 2(2)(b); that is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;advice or other services in relation to the making of a claim&quot;.</p>

&quot;(   )   any service offered for money or money&#039;s worth to persons bringing claims,&quot;

<p><a name="st_52"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to extend the definition of &quot;services&quot; to catch all services provided to claimants unless they are otherwise excluded. Again, the intention is to cover any gaps in regulatory cover. If Amendment No. 35 were accepted, Clause 2(3)(a)(iii) would read,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;referring or introducing one person to another any service offered for money or money&#039;s worth to persons bringing claims, and&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Adding the words in the amendment catches those who are carrying out what are effectively claims management services, but who carefully do not present themselves as so doing. It still excludes those who are providing free advice.
</p>

<a name="60116-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>We have already seen inventiveness in this area of definition&#151;for example, on the part of Claims Direct and the Accident Group. Certain types of service have been dressed up as wholly different services, sometimes spuriously rebranded as insurance services in circumstances that enable the claims management companies to attempt recovery of premium.
</p>

<a name="60116-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The area that I would like to highlight under the amendment is the growing market in credit rehabilitation. Here, the claimant will be recommended for rehabilitation. A solicitor will arrange the rehabilitation on a credit basis on the claimant&#039;s behalf and the claimant enters into a contract with the rehabilitation provider. The provision of the rehabilitation is a service to the claimant: it is not a financial service; it is not a legal service; it is not a referral; and it is not an inquiry. I am therefore unsure about the extent to which it is covered under the Bill, because the claimant is not paying for the service directly. The amendment is therefore required to ensure that that is caught.

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>It is not too far-fetched to imagine, in a sector as inventive as this, that claims management companies seeking to avoid regulation may move into the rehabilitation sector and then provide all the other services as ancillary to the rehabilitation provided. I dare say that the Minister will tell me that this is an inclusive provision, not an exhaustive one, but I seek to deliver a message to those whose time is up. I do that because I have become aware&#151;

<a name="60116-42_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I have become aware of this sort of problem emerging in the credit rehabilitation arena. I have merely become aware of one example; I am sure there will be many others. It is an indication of what we are up against here.
</p>

<a name="60116-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>This is a company which is offering rehabilitation services. It is contracting with the solicitors acting for the claimant on the following basis: first, it requires payment for rehabilitation services which the claimant may not actually need by stating, very clearly that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;If the claimant elects to proceed and the arrangements are put in place, a charge representing four sessions will be levied and payable, irrespective of whether the claimant proceeds or not&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>And in big black type it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;Please ensure the claimant understands this&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Secondly, on payment for the service there is an alternative. Either the firm of solicitors contracting with the company in question has to agree that on completion of the counselling sessions on the claimant,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;I will pay your invoice immediately for which the costs are &#163;100+VAT per session&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Or,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;I agree that on completion of the counselling sessions on the . . . claimant I will receive an invoice for &#163;125+VAT per session after which date I have 10 months extended credit terms to settle the account&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>So on the one hand the company which is now providing credit rehabilitation is requiring payment for four services, even though the claimant may use only one session, or, indeed, may not use any of the rehabilitation at all; or, on the other hand, the firm of lawyers has to contract either to pay &#163;100 plus VAT or an enhanced fee for the compensator which rises to &#163;125 plus VAT per session to be paid 10 months later.
</p>

<a name="60116-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I am not very good at mathematics, but I think that that rate of interest must be pretty close to 30 per cent. I do not like what is developing in the credit rehabilitation arena. The company here is called P.I.P.S. I do not know what that stands for, but the firm describes itself and the rehabilitation services as P.I.P.S. Counselling Sessions. It obviously needs some further investigation. It may be that the company would want to come forward and justify this, but it demonstrates exactly what is happening in this sector. It is not too far-fetched, as I said before, to imagine in a sector as inventive as this, that if claims management companies are seeking to avoid regulation, they will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC173"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC173</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

move into this rehabilitation sector, which is already developing, and will provide all the other services as an ancillary to the rehabilitation that is provided. I know that the Minister shares my concern about these developments, and I very much hope that she will be able to give us some reassurance about the extent to which this sort of activity will be caught. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="60116-42_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for moving his amendment. Without question, credit rehabilitation farmers would be covered and captured by the Bill. If the activities of the credit rehabilitation farmers take place in the context of making a claim or advice services <i>et cetera</i> they will fall within the regulatory ambit of the Bill. That is because Clause 2(1) lists those persons who may provide claim services if they are authorised or exempt, subject to a waiver or an individual acting otherwise than in the course of a business.
</p>

<a name="60116-42_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Clause 2(4) provides further definition of individuals acting in business terms, so they will need to apply for authorisation under the Bill. I endorse all the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, about needing to be clear about capturing the relevant bodies. Looking at how some of these areas are now being populated, we need to be even more mindful of the value of using our regulatory process to ensure that we can deal with these issues with particular companies.

</p>

<a name="60116-42_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I want to say something about the outcome of David Clementi&#039;s review. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said, it was intended that, when David Clementi reported, we would take the Clementi recommendations as a whole collection, but we decided to move forward in this particular area more speedily. Eventually, we want to integrate with those reforms. The noble Lord was right to talk about the four different areas where reform is happening and the role of the ministerial steering group is partly to ensure that we address that issue. We are planning to bring forward a draft legal services Bill in this Session, which I hope will make clear how we propose to do that. So there is no question that we would capture the credit rehabilitation farmers in the way in which the Bill has been drafted. I hope that the noble Lord feels reassured by that and is able to withdraw his amendment.

We have a number of regulators. I am not sure of the extent to which anything that I have quoted from this website could already be caught. I am concerned about a claimant having to undergo four sessions, whether or not he needs them, and then being forced to pay for those services, even if he does not use them, and then some alternative mechanism being provided which increases in interest over a 10-month period by 25 per cent.

In this case, however, the contract is not with the consumer, it is with the consumer&#039;s solicitor. Therefore, it would not be caught under the Unfair Contract Terms Act because it is not a contract with a consumer.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The problem is that on the face of it it is not one-sided because the solicitor, one would think, would be able to move to another contractor if he did not like the terms which were being offered. But, as I understand it&#151;and this is the point I would make to the noble Lord&#151;this is a developing area. It is one where we need to send some pretty clear warning signals that people are not going to step into this area and make a lot of money for themselves on the back of poor, vulnerable victims, merely by carrying out the contract with the solicitor rather than with the consumer or the claimant. Therefore, I very much welcome what the noble Baroness has said. I will certainly provide her with the evidence which has been shared with me, and then we can see what we can do to send out that warning signal to those who seek to make a profit from some poor individual&#039;s misery.

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>Perhaps I may also say how delighted I am at the way in which the Department for Work and Pensions is concentrating on rehabilitation. I do not want now to embark on a great debate about rehabilitation, but the Minister will know that for many years I have looked to the Government to provide a much greater impetus on rehabilitation. For everyone who is injured in an accident there is not always someone to blame. You could fall off a ladder at home with devastating consequences; it could happen through an act of God. There is not necessarily someone there to blame, but an injured individual needs rehabilitation whether or not there is insurance involved. I would like to see the National Health Service make one of its prime objectives&#151;as it used to be at its foundation&#151;getting people back to work and back to full health as soon as possible; and for rehabilitation to return to the centre of the National Health Service where we so urgently require it to be provided.

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>It seems to me that we are considering two basic contrasting models here. I will call one the FSA model and the other the CSC model. The FSA is an independent, non-governmental body given statutory powers under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. It is a company limited by guarantee, financed by the financial services industry, but accountable to Treasury Ministers and, through them, to Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>As the Minister will be aware, the Treasury appoints the FSA board, which sets the overall policy of the FSA, while day-to-day decisions and management of the staff are the responsibility of the executive. We debated the FSA model at great length. The only real difference of view I had with the Government was on the need for a separate chairman and chief executive. I was delighted when the Government eventually accepted that principle and I think that the present system works very well. But it is a regulator. However strongly one may feel about its individual or collective decisions, at least we know that it is independent and that it was set up under an Act of Parliament. Much more than that, however, is that it is seen to be a much respected regulator.

<a name="60116-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>We then move to what I referred to as the CSC model. In contrast to the FSA model, the Claims Standards Council is a membership organisation. Perhaps the only thing it has in common with the Financial Services Authority is that it is currently said to be financed by the private sector. It has a draft code of conduct entitled &quot;Members&#039; Rules&quot;. In setting out the members&#039; rules and describing itself, the Claims Standards Council says that the council,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;is a Not for Profit organisation created in 2004 specifically to act as a regulatory body for those organisations and individuals that volunteer to be regulated&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>What that does not make clear is that the Claims Standards Council is a membership organisation.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Although the CSC has this draft code of conduct and seeks to provide a kitemark of sorts to its members, ultimately it is a representative, not a regulatory organisation. I suppose in the world of financial services the parallel would perhaps be with the Association of British Insurers rather than the FSA. No one would expect the ABI to take on regulatory functions in this respect, and, indeed, it has never done so.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>So I hope that in the debate we can focus first on what sort of model we have in mind. We will have later debates about the status of the regulator, the nature and type of regulator, but I think we must be clear about the kind of regulatory model we need to establish for claims farmers. It is worth saying that I believe strongly that the FSA model is broadly the better one. I believe that we should import most, or even all, of its key features across as we decide exactly how we are going to regulate claims farmers.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The Minister knows that if I had my way I would want the FSA to regulate claims management companies. Indeed, I wanted the FSA to regulate mortgage providers and all providers of travel insurance. But there is always a limit to the extent of the remit that can be given the Financial Services Authority. I have on several occasions spoken to senior members of the FSA and they say, &quot;Please don&#039;t give us any more responsibility while we concentrate on getting right the responsibilities we have now&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>As the Minister will recall, I have made available my correspondence with the FSA in which I sought to persuade it perhaps to clip the wings of those who seek to make unfair profits out of those who have valid endowment mis-selling claims, in particular when a free service is available from the ombudsman. But I have not succeeded yet in that, although I am grateful to the Minister for giving me an opportunity to raise some of my concerns with the economics Secretary. I look forward to doing that.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>My conclusion is very much to prefer the FSA model. The key features to which I refer are that the FSA is a totally independent body whose powers are based in statute rather than contract. The FSA has the power to make rules as to the authorisation of specific firms and, in addition, for approved persons within those firms. That allows for a situation where a company must be authorised before it can carry out specific types of business. The key personnel in that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC177"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC177</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

firm must also be approved for that specific role within the firm and will have individual liability for compliance with the rules. Of course, there is a central register for authorised firms and approved individuals. There is continuing assessment on compliance with the rules.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>I should declare an interest as chairman of the Professional Standards Board of the Chartered Insurance Institute. I work closely with the regulator in upholding the highest possible professional standards in the insurance industry. But I detect that the situation I describe is very far from what could happen&#151;I repeat, could happen&#151;because I sense that the noble Baroness is not yet persuaded that the CSC model is the right one to take forward. I have not, of course, seen the report of the eminent consultant, Mr Boleat, but I know that I speak for Members of the Committee when I say that we look forward to hearing from the noble Baroness as and when she is able to make available those sections of the report which can more easily be disclosed. I accept that it is right to ask the CSC to comment on the report before it reads any of it through any other avenue, which is only fair and right.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>As continuing assessment across the board would be almost impossible for any regulator to enforce, the FSA also has the power to assess risk and to focus its intentions on those sectors or individual firms where it considers that such assessment is most needed, which is really what attracts me about the FSA model and why I would like to see it extended to this arena&#151;although I recognise that it would be difficult to persuade it to do so.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Ministers have already accepted that self regulation has been an abject failure. While the industry was being given an opportunity to sort itself out, some of the more glaring examples of abuse have emerged. I am very concerned about the way in which unfortunate and vulnerable people have to deliver up to a number of people making profit key parts of their damages or compensation under the existing system. I know that the noble Baroness shares the view that it would be good if one could just transform the situation overnight, but one cannot. One has to recognise that the situation is getting worse. Self regulation has failed and every day the situation deteriorates.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>It does not make sense to try to create some sort of hybrid embodying substantial aspects of the existing discredited system. In considering the CSC model, one must ask who created that organisation, who finances it and to whom it is accountable. I am sure that the organisation would like to give us more information. If the Minister is ever tempted to go down that route, we would press her for much more information but, for the moment, we are unaware of the finance and support that that organisation receives. However, there is no doubt that it was originally&#151;and to some extent remains&#151;a membership organisation. A membership organisation will look for what is in the best interests of its membership. Undoubtedly, at some stage, its members decided that the best way forward, faced with a statutory regulator, was to create a regulator that could become that statutory <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC178"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC178</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

regulator&#151;to create a regulator which could impose, service and administer a system of self-regulation. That has gone by the board. They have now been told that it must be statutory regulation. Lo and behold, we are presented with a possible regulator. I hope that the Minister will not be misled in any way by some of the claims made; indeed, I know that she is just the sort of person who will not be misled by such claims. We must get this right and the system must endure for many years to come. We do not want to have to revisit this.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>My noble friend Lord Eccles has said that this is the sort of area where people will find some way through and that it is therefore impossible to cover all eventualities. Either one presents legislation that is so all-encompassing that it becomes completely unenforceable and burdensome on the free enterprise system; or one seeks to target and to focus on the worst excesses. I agree with my noble friend that to do that, it is necessary to have a regulator based on the FSA model. We shall debate a little later whether that is possible.
</p>

<a name="60116-43_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>I have suggested that the regulator should be the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor&#151;this is probably one of the few occasions on which I have expressed such a degree of confidence in him. However, he is the sort of person, with the full panoply of the Government, who could take on the role. At some stage it would be necessary to try to hand over to a future body. It may well be that, as the noble learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said, it should be the Legal Services Board. We have heard him talk about that and we have a lot of sympathy with the proposal. Whatever is to be the ultimate regulator, we must get from here to there. I far prefer the FSA model to the CSC model. I shall be interested to hear what the noble Baroness has to say. I beg to move.

Suffice it to say that I think it is an impressive report and I shall put into the public domain as much as I can.

</p>

<a name="60116-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>In my response to the noble Lord, I want to say a few words about my approach. I agree that we must be clear that the model we choose works, not only for the present circumstances, but also for the future. We think that around 500 companies will be covered. While we do not know, we can speculate about what will happen once the regulatory body comes into effect and whether some companies will simply disappear. We have other experiences to draw on that will indicate what might happen in that regard. We know that the initial stages of the work of the regulator will be that of identification and authorisation, and thus will be different from its future work, which might be described as a watching brief. It may then undertake further work to identify areas across the sector that might need regulation. It will alert the Government to any specific problems it identifies.
</p>

<a name="60116-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The body will need to be flexible and able to develop its skills appropriately. It will need to recognise changes and to be able to take both a short-term and a long-term view. I am therefore keen to look at the kind of model which will best deliver that, bearing in mind what we have already said about future legislation in legal services, which will have a direct bearing on this.
</p>

<a name="60116-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for his comments about my noble and learned friend. One of the options available is for the Lord Chancellor himself to regulate, whether directly or through some other mechanism. He would take on the role but would then designate a suitable body to do the work. Those options, such as the equivalent of the FSA model&#151;the noble Lord knows that the FSA does not wish to take on this work&#151;or another body, perhaps the Claims Standards Council dependent upon its response to the report, and the Lord Chancellor are all options that are very much being borne in mind. I will consider these options fully, but my aspiration is that once the report is available and I have had further conversations with a number of organisations, and not least with my noble and learned friend, we will be able to have a fuller debate on how this issue is taken forward. By the Report stage, we should be in a position to indicate our proposals in this regard. Noble Lords will then know how we plan to approach this.
</p>

<a name="60116-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>That is as much as I feel able to say at this stage, but I hope that noble Lords are reassured that we are mindful of both the present and the future, and that we will ensure that we have a model which will deliver effectively. We have not closed off any options at this stage, but we are clear that by the Report stage we want to have moved on to a point at which the future direction of travel is clear.
</p>

<a name="60116-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I could not consider accepting this amendment in any event because Amendment No. 51 will enable the Secretary of State to do what Amendment No. 36 asks for in terms of designating an individual. The preference of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is in any case for me to consider Amendment No. 51, which we discussed with an earlier group. However, that is a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC180"></a>

formality and I do not think the noble Lord is seeking to press this amendment, but to use it in order to discuss the issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60116-44_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I thank the Minister for that response. She has said that the FSA does not wish to take this on, and a question runs through my mind: to whom is the FSA accountable and who decides what it should take on? Of course I have something of a record here; under previous administrations I did myself create several regulators. Perhaps I may take a moment to confess that in those days I may not have paid sufficient attention to the answer to the question: who regulates the regulators? This issue will absorb a lot more of our time over the coming months and years as we seek to establish a system whereby the regulator is not the final arbiter, but there is redress for the consumer, the customer or the organisation that feels it has in some way been badly treated.
</p>

<a name="60116-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>But my point is even more fundamental: who tells the regulator what it should or should not do? I hate to say this to the Minister, and I am sure that she does not conduct her ministerial responsibilities in this way, but without knowing her, an outside observer would think that she has just accepted the fact that the FSA has decided that it does not want to do this work and so it will not do it. Of course she was not saying that at all. She has said that she does not feel that it is appropriate for the FSA to take on this particular responsibility. If that is the case, I look forward to an opportunity to persuade her that this is a responsibility for that body, certainly so far as financial products or policies or insurance are concerned. It is an area over which the FSA ought to exercise more scrutiny, even if it does mean an extension of its powers.

very much welcome that. However, perhaps I may take issue for a moment with her on the conflict with Amendment No. 51. I do not necessarily agree that if Amendment No. 51 is agreed to, we cannot agree to Amendment No. 36 as well. My explanation is that Amendment No. 51 fills in a gap, while action under Amendment No. 36 is awaited. Amendment No. 36 should require the Lord Chancellor to act, but it does not specify a time when the Lord Chancellor is required to designate a regulator, simply that at some point he must do so.
</p>

<a name="60116-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>However, the Chairman of Committees has already referred to my speech as a winding up contribution. I had better do so. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="60116-44_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goodhart </b>   moved Amendment No. 37:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>Page 2, line 35, leave out &quot;designate a person&quot; and insert &quot;establish an office&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>The noble Lord said: This is the first of an important group of amendments. In moving Amendment No. 37, I shall therefore speak also to Amendments Nos. 38, 45 and 50. The Bill is extremely vague about who the regulator will be. The regulator can be a public body set up by the Secretary of State; it can be an individual appointed as the regulator; it can be the Secretary of State himself, although that is perhaps the least desirable of the possibilities. It can be a private sector body such as a trade association representing the providers of claims management services&#151;a frontline body, as I think it has been described. That is much too vague and is plainly part of the cause of the serious concerns expressed by the Delegated Powers Committee.
</p>

<a name="60116-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>What this group of amendments tries to do is provide that the office of the regulator must be a public office. That could be through a public corporation or through an individual appointed as the holder of the office. But it should not be a private sector corporate body such as the Claims Standards Council. I believe that there would be a serious danger. It is of course possible for a professional body to be a regulator and to exercise regulatory powers in professions comprising many members. That would be true, for example, of the Bar Council or the Law Society, although even there the regulation is very much subject to oversight by the Legal Services Ombudsman. But if only a small number of members are carrying out the regulated business, it is plain that conflicts of interest will inevitably arise.
</p>

<a name="60116-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>If the regulator is an association whose members conduct claims management business, there is an obvious risk of a conflict of interest. For example, it must be in the interests of members of the association to restrict the number of new entrants and to make it as hard as possible to satisfy the entry tests so as to reduce competition. Again, a conflict of interest would arise when the association considers whether to make rules which may have an adverse effect on the profits of its members. Of course I do not accuse the Claims Standards Council of doing that, and in any case it is not yet a regulatory body. But any body that is in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC182"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC182</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

position of the Claims Standards Council, as a body whose membership is made up of members of a limited number of businesses taking part in a particular role, will be subject to serious tests of conflict of interest. It is desirable that the regulator should be removed as far as possible from those conflicts. We are not dealing here with a traditional profession, but with a relatively small group of businesses. Members of the regulatory body will be potentially in direct competition with applications for authorisation. It is therefore plain beyond doubt that the regulator should be the holder of a public office which could include the Secretary of State&#151;although as I have said that would not be desirable; it could be a public body that already exists, or it could be a new public body incorporated for the purpose. That is another possibility.
</p>

<a name="60116-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>It is very unfortunate that the Government have not been able to sort out their own ideas on who should be the regulator before bringing forward the Bill. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, mentioned earlier that I had said at a previous stage that this Bill was premature. The reason I feel that it is premature is that while it is necessary not to lose any time in regulating claims management companies, it is also desirable in circumstances of this kind that the Government, when they launch such legislation, should have a clear idea of how they actually intend to regulate these businesses. However, so far the Government have been unable to do that. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="60116-45_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for his explanation of this group of amendments. I say at the beginning that I do not think the Bill is premature in any way. I understand the noble Lord&#039;s argument that he seeks clarity and for the Government to explain their position, but I have indicated that as the Bill moves forward it is one of my ambitions to take on board the comments of noble Lords as we develop the way in which the Government will seek to regulate in this context and to deal with the other issues that have been raised. At all stages of our deliberations in Committee I will be as forthcoming as I can with information.
</p>

<a name="60116-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>While I do not suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said this, it is not that the Government do not have some clear ideas, but that we think there are options available to us. We should be open in saying that we want to consider whether the only body from the sector itself could conceivably turn into a regulator. We have invited independent professional advice to examine whether that is the case. I have indicated that we will make available to Members of the Committee as much information about the report as possible. However, I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, will agree that the Claims Standards Council should be given a chance to respond to the report before we do so. That will be done very soon.


</p>

<a name="60116-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>We have also wanted to examine with others involved in the regulatory field where there is an appropriate existing regulator and to seek the views of those bodies on whether they could take this on. We have also sought their views on how they think the market might change in the future and what their role <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC183"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC183</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

might be. We have had some interesting discussions on that point. However, if neither of those two options is appropriate or forthcoming, we will take the power ourselves and my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor will regulate. I have indicated that that might be done either directly through the department or indirectly.
</p>

<a name="60116-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>Although it may appear to the noble Lord that the Government do not have a clear vision, we do. We have a set of clear options which we now wish to determine upon and thus to establish which way to go. We have brought this legislation forward on that basis. On Report, noble Lords will have an opportunity to challenge what the Government are doing and, indeed, to vote if they feel that it is appropriate to do so. We do not deny that opportunity. However, it is hugely beneficial to me to listen to the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Hunt, describe their particular views on how they believe this regulation might take place. I am also keen to hear their views on, for example, the work of the Claims Standards Council and the issues they feel are critically important regarding how regulation in this area should be taken forward. I feel that I benefit from the process. We are moving towards giving noble Lords real clarity of vision on how this is to be taken forward both in the short term and over the longer term.
</p>

<a name="60116-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>I am not sure whether the noble Lord wants me to give him the precise Government view on each of his amendments. In a sense I may have identified his overarching issue; that is, his concern about the designation of a regulator being a fundamental part of what we are doing as quickly as possible. In my view, that should be done in time for noble Lords to present their considered views. Further, while I understand his concerns about a private body, I am not yet in a position to tell him whether he has reason to be so concerned. Indeed, it may well be that in due course the noble Lord is entirely satisfied with how the Government move forward in this area. It would be nice if that were the case. But I am sure he will understand that I must wait until I am in a position to give a definitive view, which I hope will be very shortly. On that basis, I hope he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

While I can see that at this stage the Government may wish to retain some flexibility, with no disrespect at all to the members of the Claims Standards Council, it should have been obvious to the Government from the beginning that the council is not an appropriate body to act as the regulator because of the nature of its membership and the possibility of conflicts of interest.

<a name="60116-45_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   In fairness to the body, we said that there was no question that in order for it to become the regulator it would not exist in its present form. We asked Mr Boleat to look at whether the council could become a regulator. I agree with the noble Lord that as things currently stand, it could not, but the question is whether in future it could.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="60116-45_spnew5"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   Will the Minister comment on one issue. As the Bill is drafted,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;The Regulator shall . . . comply with any directions given to him by the Secretary of State; . . . have regard to any guidance given to him by the Secretary of State; . . . have regard to any code of practice issued to him by the Secretary of State&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>and many other minor issues such as information. Returning to my noble friend&#039;s original approach to regulation, the FSA model is not on offer because under the Bill there is no question of the regulator being independent. The regulator must do what the regulator is told to do and in the way that the regulator is told to do it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="60116-45_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount. I understand that there is an arm&#039;s length relationship between the FSA and the Treasury, but there is a relationship. If the FSA were designated in this way, we would look at the Bill to ensure that it fitted with what needs to happen. In our design of the Bill, we believe that most of the cases we have in mind would be covered without having to amend it. But of course if amendment were needed we would make it. I think that addresses the noble Viscount&#039;s point.

<a name="60116-45_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I am delighted that I have this opportunity to pay tribute to the wise words of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I agree with the points he made, just as he agreed with the points I made. There is a consensus in the Committee. We are greatly assisted by the fact that we are joined by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, the Government Deputy Chief Whip. We can refer not only to this amendment but we can explain that the Minister has just given a series of commitments on what she will do before Report.

</p>

<a name="60116-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Perhaps I may explain that all this arises out of the Deregulatory Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#039;s 7th report, in which it concluded:


</p>

We all want to see it done as quickly as possible, but I hope that the business managers will permit the Minister sufficient time to ensure that she is able to comply with the extensive commitments that she has given to the Committee and for which we are grateful.

&quot;(   )   is competent to ensure that the standards of competence and professional conduct among authorised persons who are regulated by the Regulator are sufficient to secure adequate protection for consumers, and that the claims management services provided by such persons are provided both economically and efficiently,&quot;

<p><a name="st_84"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 39 has been proposed by the Law Society, and it is based on the wording taken from the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, when that Act was setting up the Council for Licensed Conveyancers. The Bill does not state clearly the purpose of the regulation. Clause 3(2)(c) gives some guidance, as it refers to ensuring that arrangements are made for the protection of persons using regulated claims management services. It does not indicate, as I believe it should, that protection of consumers is the primary purpose of the legislation and that everything else is secondary to that. The amendment would do just that. It would be of guidance to the courts and to others who will read this Bill when it becomes an Act to know the fundamental purpose behind it. The fundamental purpose is to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC186"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC186</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ensure that, as Amendment No. 39 proposes, there is protection for consumers from rogue claim management service providers. It is a short amendment and therefore I have made a short speech in support of it. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="60116-46_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising an entirely valid point; consumer protection is paramount. These services should indeed be provided economically and efficiently, and they seem to me to be the guiding principle of regulation. I am happy to accept in principle that they should appear in the Bill. I will take the amendment away to consider further, and I will bring something forward on Report. In addition, something to this effect will appear in the regulator&#039;s rules and code of practice. I am being equally brief. We will bring something back; it is just that the drafting does not quite work as it stands.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="60116-46_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   It might be a good opportunity to ask two questions about claims management services and the professional people to carry them out. First, &quot;claims management services&quot; presumably means the exercise of the management of resisting claims as well as of making them. If that were not true, we could have firms that set up in the resisting of claims and went on to arrangements as to how they would be remunerated. Secondly, presumably when we come to authorisation it will not only be those people who are intending to go to law that we shall be considering, but those people who settle out of court. That means, I assume, that every single insurance company will have to be authorised, or be excused from being authorised, because they all manage claims.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="60116-46_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The FSA regulates insurance companies, so I am not sure that quite meets the point. In terms of the resisting of claims, I hesitate to think how that is quite what these organisations might do. Again, it goes back to the way in which we have constructed the Bill. If we were concerned that in this sector there was an issue around resisting claims we would be able to look at that, and that is the advantage of the way the regulations are set out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="60116-46_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   The noble Viscount raised an interesting point. I can envisage that there could be some cases in which claims management services could be involved in the resistance of claims, particularly on matters of dispute between two people, neither of whom is wealthy or is conducting a business; disputes over boundaries between houses, for example, which tend to raise a great deal of bitterness and cost a great deal of money. It would be desirable to make it clear that there could be advice or other services in relation to the making of a claim or in relation to the resisting of a claim; that is a fair point, although it would obviously be much less likely. Whether insurance companies will have to be authorised under the legislation, I am more doubtful. However, this is not the time to go into that. No doubt the Minister and her team will consider whether it is a possibility.

<a name="60116-46_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral </b>   moved Amendment No. 40:


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>Page 2, line 42, leave out paragraph (b) and insert&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_3"></a><br>
&quot;(b)   is independent of any provider of claims management services,&quot;

<p><a name="st_90"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment follows the debate we have had on previous amendments. It singles out independence as a key issue. Amendment No. 40 would leave out paragraph (b) on page 2, line 42, which reads:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;will make arrangements to avoid any conflict of interest between the person&#039;s functions as Regulator and any other functions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>It would insert a new paragraph (b), stating,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;is independent of any provider of claims management services&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60116-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Nothing in the Bill appears to require the regulator to be independent of any service provider. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, referred to that a while ago when he specifically named the Claims Standards Council and its lack of clear independence. It had previously been the Claims Standards Federation, which was a representative organisation, and it has evolved out of that background. There is therefore a history in this sector which, combined with the failure to proceed down the self-regulatory route makes us believe that an amendment similar to Amendment No. 40, if not this one, must be incorporated in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60116-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a> We need more than self-regulation on stilts. I can see the argument for providing those stilts, but as currently drafted the clause does not go anything like far enough in providing certainty that the regulator will possess independence and will be a regulator whose integrity is beyond doubt and whose impartiality is sacrosanct. I want to see the regulator embody the three qualities of independence, integrity and impartiality because the regulator must be able to stand between the claims management companies and the public. However, the legislation as drafted, in particular with paragraph (b) relating to conflict of interest, might give the impression that the regulator might need to take steps to ensure that he or she is not conflicted. That will not inspire public confidence.
</p>

<a name="60116-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>We have already made the point about independence and I do not detect that there is a willingness in the Committee to compromise on that, particularly given the widespread assumption, to which the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has referred, that the Claims Standards Council is seen as a candidate for the role of regulator.
</p>

<a name="60116-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>We have not had explained to us&#151;I may have missed it&#151;what happened overnight between 21 March, when the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor referred to self-regulation, and 22 March when he announced statutory regulations. But we have only to see the speed with which the noble and learned Lord has moved from advocating self-regulation to the proposals in this Bill to realise the need for outside intervention. I hasten to add that I am not criticising <br>&nbsp;<br>

him for seeing the light, although self-regulation in this sector was always an ambitious enterprise. I voiced that view on several occasions. Now we are where I wanted us to be and I share everyone&#039;s concern that this regulator should be set up as quickly as possible. But please may we entrench the independence of the regulator by accepting the amendment?
</p>

<a name="60116-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I make only one reference, which is to the report of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux on the challenges to access to injury compensation, entitled, <i>No win, no fee, no chance</i>, to which I know the noble Baroness has already referred.

<a name="60116-46_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for explaining what he seeks to do. I was not aware that I was supposed to identify what happened to the Lord Chancellor between the 21st and 22nd. The noble Lord did not ask so I hope that I have not been remiss in not answering. I interpreted what happened on the 21st as a trailing of what was going to happen on the 22nd, but that may be my interpretation of what was said. From his experience in government, the noble Lord will know that one is mindful of ensuring that announcements are made appropriately. I have not discussed it with my noble and learned friend. If the noble Lord wants to do so, I am sure that my noble and learned friend would be delighted to explain precisely what was happening between one day and the next. As I said, I think that it was pretty well trailed.
</p>

<a name="60116-46_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>In Clause 3(2)(b), we have sought to replicate what is good practice in regulation. Those concerned with regulation have invaluable knowledge and expertise of the market and we are not convinced that it is possible to regulate effectively without involving them. For example, the board of the Financial Services Authority, to which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, referred, includes a number of non-executive members from the industry. The Law Society&#039;s new regulatory board comprises a mixture of solicitors and lay members. Although I completely accept that the regulator should not be influenced by commercial interests, the requirement to avoid conflicts of interest is sufficient to ensure that. The experience of the bodies I have mentioned, along with others, should give people certainty and a sense of confidence that that will again be the case.
</p>

<a name="60116-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I have listened with interest to what the noble Lord said and will of course reflect on it, as I do with all comments made in Committee, but we have made this regulatory body reflect good practice elsewhere that has been recognised to be satisfactory. It is partly about transparency and partly about effective regulation that the governing body, the designated <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC189"></a>

regulatory body, should include members of the sector it regulates. It is good practice elsewhere; it has stood us in good stead; that is why we do it.
</p>

<a name="60116-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The critical point raised by the noble Lord is that it needs to be transparent. It must be absolutely clear that there is no conflict of commercial interest. I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment. We have done that in reflecting good practice elsewhere, but I am always happy to discuss it further if the noble Lord wants.

<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="60116-47_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I want to refer to a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, which is that we are here dealing with quite a small sector. We are not dealing with the scope of the Financial Services Authority, which extends to insurance companies, banks, asset management&#151;the list is almost endless&#151;or of the Law Society, which deals with 85,000 solicitors. We are here dealing with a comparatively small number of claims management companies who are falling under this scrutiny because of what I believe to be the irresponsible actions of some of them.
</p>

<a name="60116-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>I suppose that what I am really stressing is that with such a small sector as this, the person&#151;although it can be a corporation&#151;should be independent of any provider of claims management services. I hope that the Minister will see my comments in that light. She is right to stress that the Financial Services Authority has on its board not only people who are administering it as regulators but people from the industry. In a way, that is to have a balanced view. The regulator may well want to set up an advisory committee on which there would be providers of claims management services to provide that interface between the regulator and the industry; but the regulator should not be someone who provides claims management services. I hope that the    Minister will understand the purpose of the amendment in more focused terms. I recognise that in many ways she is seeking to meet the point, and I very much welcome some of the comments that she has made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="60116-47_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   I have a problem, because we are intending to deal with claims management companies, but I do not know whether what we are actually dealing with is claims management services. I am not a parliamentary draftsman; others will know better what that means when in a court than I. I doubt whether it means just claims management companies as set up since the ending of legal aid in 2000. If it did mean that, we would have to say that, would we not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60116-47_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   That is a good point. I will be guided by the noble Baroness, but as I understand it the sector providing claims management services is concentrated in a comparatively small number of companies compared to the insurance industry or the legal profession. The Minister may well in a better position to respond to my noble friend than I am. My noble friend has raised a number of interesting questions about who falls within the definition of claims management services. Again, without seeing the draft regulations and the various other secondary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC190"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC190</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legislative instruments that are proposed, I cannot respond with certainty to my noble friend&#039;s question. It may well be that the Minister can.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="60116-47_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Eccles: </b>   On a very specific point; is an insurance broker not a claims management service provider?
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="60116-47_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I shall try to shed some light on this. We have tried to incorporate in the Bill what we call a funnel, which means that we have set out a very broad definition so that we can then look across the sector and determine where there are areas of risk that we can designate. We think that there are probably about 500 companies operating in this area. One issue for the regulator would be to look across to confirm that. I was trying to make the point earlier that one issue in determining the regulator is ensuring that we recognise what may happen in the market as companies leave if they see that they may not be allowed to continue in the way that they have. We are also looking wider than that at other individuals or organisations who may be involved in the provision of services in the sector. We have not sought at this stage to define them completely, but we will do so as we produce the regulation.
</p>

<a name="60116-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>When it comes to who might be on the board of a regulator, of course the complete range of organisations or individuals would be considered. Although I accept that it is a smaller market, it is not that small at this stage. I am sure that noble Lords would accept that there are companies, individuals and organisations behaving perfectly reputably in this area. For example, one might wish to put on the board a representative from a trade union or from another organisation and one or two companies on the lay member side.
</p>

<a name="60116-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>The point that I sought to make was that the good regulatory practice that exists thus far was to have reputable people from the area being regulated in order for them to provide an input in an appropriate, transparent way that does not deal with the issue of commercial interests becoming a way in which people operate in a negative way. That is the basis on which we have done it. There is scope and a real opportunity for those companies and organisations which provide a good service to participate in an appropriate and most critically transparent manner. In terms of the specifics on insurance brokers, some could be claims handlers, but if they are not regulated by someone else, we can regulate them. That would be the way that we could approach that. As I have already said, we have deliberately kept the definition wide in order that we can narrow it&#151;that is, the funnel approach&#151;so that we can deal with these particular areas of high risk effectively and as quickly as possible. But I am keen that we recognise the contribution that reputable companies and organisations play in helping us in the regulatory field.
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="60116-47_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   This has been an interesting debate, which cannot come to a conclusion. The more that I have listened to the contributions of my noble friends and the Minister, the more that I am <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC191"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC191</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

increasingly concerned about this wide definition. There may be a number of providers of services out there which will be caught by the wider definition. Of course, at a later stage we will come to the exemptions. If we are catching providers of claims management services in a very wide sense, we need to have a better idea of exactly who we are bringing within this definition. Currently, the noble Baroness mentions 500 companies, but I can imagine that that could be narrowed to 100 companies or expanded to several thousand companies. We need to have some thought about where the boundaries will be.
</p>

<a name="60116-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a> At Second Reading, the Minister said that she would exempt trade unions and a number of other bodies. I am not quite sure whether they are included in this wide definition, because they should be if they are to be exempt. Therefore, if 500 companies is the wide market, what will be the targeted or focused market? It occurs to me that we are dealing with a comparatively small number of companies.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="60116-47_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   It is a smallish number of companies, but trade unions are not included in that. They are not companies. I am describing commercial companies, of which we think that there are about 500 involved. The noble Lord is right to seek clarification, which we propose to do, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC192"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column GC192</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about precisely who will be determined within regulation. Members of the Committee will have the opportunity to look at that. The critical issue on the breadth of the definition is that by capturing people and organisations in this way, should a point come when we need to regulate in another part of this sector the particular concerns that we have, we have the power to do it quickly, which Members of the Committee have urged me on and we have addressed in this way. Of course the noble Lord is right that it will be increasingly important to be clear about precisely who comes under the definition. It will be through affirmative regulations that we will do that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="60116-47_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I am greatly assisted by the noble Baroness in that further clarification.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>In 2004&#150;05, Bridgend County Borough Council administered some &#163;33.3 million in housing benefits, about 14.8 per cent of its gross revenue expenditure. The inspection focused on the council&#039;s arrangements for processing claims, as it was taking an average of 58 days to process new claims for housing benefit in 2004&#150;05. The council introduced a new benefits IT system in April 2004. The subsequent transfer of data and issues with installation resulted in the IT system being inaccessible for six weeks. This led to backlogs of work. Senior management and members were supportive of the need to address this and employed temporary staff to clear the work.

</p>

<a name="60116-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>BFI found that the outstanding work on new claims had been cleared by April 2005 and that processing performance in this area had since improved to 30 days. The inspection identified no other backlogs of work. Inspectors found that the council had largely overcome difficulties with the implementation of the new benefits IT system and had many good practices in place. The main aspect of performance that required attention related to processing changes of circumstances, which remained below the department&#039;s standard. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI&#039;s findings.

</p>

<a name="60116-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>In 2004&#150;05, Bromsgrove District Council administered some &#163;10.5 million in housing benefits, about 33 per cent of its gross revenue expenditure. There had been sustained improvement in the reported time taken to process new claims, from an average of 50 days in 2003&#150;04 to 44 days in 2004&#150;05 and 42 days for the first quarter of 2005&#150;06. However, this performance was still below the department&#039;s standard of 36 days.
</p>

<a name="60116-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>BFI found that a lack of prioritisation and inefficient practices were creating unnecessary delays at each stage of the claims process. This was compounded by a failure to ensure that the evidence provided by its customers met the minimum requirements of the department&#039;s verification framework. Members and senior officers were not aware of very poor performance in preventing and recovering benefit overpayments and overpayment debt had increased by almost 400 per cent between 2002&#150;03 and 2004&#150;05. Very little action was being taken to minimise avoidable overpayments.
</p>

<a name="60116-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>Performance in the application of sanctions against benefit fraudsters was found to have improved. The council applied 11 sanctions in 2002&#150;03, increasing to 37 in 2004&#150;05. However, it had failed to prosecute offenders in nine instances where fraud had been proven. This was due to delays within its legal services department. The inspection revealed that management information provided to members, senior officers and the department was often inaccurate with performance being overstated in some instances. Inspectors found minimal management checks being carried out, inadequate audit coverage and a failure to act on audit recommendations. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is considering the report and may ask the council for proposals in response to BFI&#039;s findings.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>On behalf of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on Falkirk Council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.
</p>

<a name="60116-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>In 2004&#150;05 Falkirk Council administered some &#163;37.7 million in housing benefits, about 10 per cent of its gross revenue expenditure. The inspection focused on the council&#039;s counter-fraud arrangements, as it reported to the department that it had not applied any sanctions between April 2003 and March 2005.
</p>

<a name="60116-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>BFI found that the council had strengths in its processes to limit the opportunities for fraud and error to enter the benefit system. In particular, claims were   consistently verified to the standard of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS23"></a>

department&#039;s verification framework and effective arrangements were in place to carry out claim reviews and data matches. However, while the council had a prosecution policy, the inspection found that it did not apply it in practice. Its failure to administer any form of counter-fraud sanction had undermined the council&#039;s ability to create an anti-fraud culture and send a clear message to benefit fraudsters.
</p>

<a name="60116-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>The inspection also revealed that the council lacked key management controls over its counter-fraud activities. Its investigation work and file management were ineffective and there was a need to improve the monitoring of performance and analysis of casework within the fraud team. Falkirk Council has acknowledged its shortcomings in this area and there is a commitment to improve performance, which includes developing an action plan to address the recommendations made in BFI&#039;s report. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI&#039;s findings.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>On behalf of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on South Northamptonshire Council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.
</p>

<a name="60116-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>In 2004&#150;05, South Northamptonshire Council administered some &#163;8.7 million in housing benefits, about 20 per cent of its gross revenue expenditure. The inspection focused on the council&#039;s arrangements for processing claims, as it was taking an average of 104 days to process new claims for housing benefit in 2003&#150;04.
</p>

<a name="60116-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>BFI found that the council&#039;s performance in processing new claims had significantly improved. The average time taken had reduced from 104 days in 2003&#150;04 to 81.5 days in 2004&#150;05, and 43.5 days in the first quarter of 2005&#150;06. While this remained longer than the department&#039;s standard of 36 days, there had clearly been a considerable improvement in the council&#039;s performance. The inspection revealed a similar situation in the time taken to process changes of circumstances, which had improved from an average of 44 days in 2003&#150;04, to 19.7 days in 2004&#150;05, and 18.7 days in the first quarter of 2005&#150;06. Again, this performance was below the department&#039;s standard of nine days, but represented a significant improvement.
</p>

<a name="60116-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The council&#039;s lack of workload prioritisation and forward planning was causing unnecessary delays. In particular, it had not set any internal targets for <br>&nbsp;<br>

benefits staff. This was compounded by a lack of procedural guidance throughout the benefits service, leading to inconsistent working practices. Inspectors found that this was one of a number of internal audit recommendations that the council had failed to act upon. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI&#039;s findings.

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="60116-48_spmin3"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Industry and the Regions (Alun Michael).
</p>

<a name="60116-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>I am pleased to announce that today, with Edwina Hart AM MBE, the Welsh Assembly Government Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration, I am publishing the analysis of our consultation, held last year, on <i>Improving Payment Practices in the Construction Industry</i>.

</p>

<a name="60116-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>The consultation proposed a number of amendments to Part II of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 and the Scheme for Construction Contracts (England and Wales) Regulations 1998. In the light of the consultation response I am proposing to:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>introduce a requirement that certification of the sum due, by one of the contracting parties or a third party, becomes an essential feature of contractual payment mechanisms;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>remove the Section 110(2) requirement for a payer notice;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>introduce a right to apply for payment where a certificate is not issued by the due date;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>make certain payment mechanisms including pay-when-certified clauses ineffective;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>enhance the existing right of suspension under the Construction Act to allow the suspending party to claim for loss and expense;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>prohibit the use of trustee stakeholder accounts for awards made by adjudicators;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>make &quot;final and conclusive&quot; clauses unenforceable where they apply to decisions under the contract that are of substance to interim payments only; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_7"></a>take forward the Government&#039;s existing commitment to make contractual agreements on adjudication costs unenforceable and to provide a statutory framework for allocating them, including cases where adjudicators resign in response to a challenge to jurisdiction.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60116-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>Our aim is to improve upon the existing legislative framework, which is generally recognised as making a valuable contribution to fairness in the way construction contracts are agreed and operated. The legislation is largely working as was intended, thanks to the willingness of the construction industry and its clients to develop their culture in the light of a changed legal framework. This is in the context of an ongoing process of change and improvement in the construction industry.

</p>

<a name="60116-48_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The consultation has demonstrated strong support for continued regulation of construction contracts and the current process improving the current framework. We have received 356 consultation responses&#151;a startling demonstration of the level of interest in these issues in the construction industry and among its stakeholders. We are very grateful to all those who responded. They have had to consider some difficult and complex issues, which have required careful analysis and innovative solutions. Launching this consultation last year, my predecessor as Minister with responsibility for construction, Nigel Griffiths, observed that,

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_8"></a>&quot;Fair payment practice is something everyone agrees with and a fair payment culture underpins any progressive and modern industry&quot;.</p>
</ul>

<a name="60116-48_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>That is something that all the responses have recognised.

<a name="60116-48_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>The analysis also sets out the next steps we intend to take, working with the construction industry over the coming months, to ensure the package of amendments is based upon a clear and thorough understanding of all the issues, when it is published for further consultation. The DTI has already asked a sounding board of key figures in the industry to assist in the development of the proposals to ensure they match the needs of the construction industry and its clients, as well the strict requirements of the regulatory reform order framework.

<a name="60116-49_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Gas Quality </h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="60116-49_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister of State for Energy (Malcolm Wicks) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60116-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>On 8 January 2004, in a Written Ministerial Statement (<i>Official Report</i>, House of Commons; cols. 13&#150;14WS), the then Minister with responsibility for energy launched the second phase of a three-phase strategy addressing the issue of future changes to the quality of gas imports to Great Britain. I can now inform the House that assessment of the available policy options, under phase 2 of the exercise, is complete. All of the available evidence points to a strong case for retaining the current gas quality specifications, and during the Christmas Recess the Government launched a public consultation on this basis.
</p>

<a name="60116-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>Phase 1 of this exercise, an independent scoping report commissioned by Government, was completed in November 2003. It confirmed that the Wobbe Index specification of certain anticipated gas imports is, before processing, likely to fall outside the current limits of the Health and Safety Executive&#039;s Gas Safety (Management) Regulations (GS(M)R). In light of Great Britain&#039;s increasing dependence on imported gas, phase 2 of the exercise was launched to identify an appropriate policy response.
</p>

<a name="60116-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>As stated in previous announcements, our broad policy options appear to be to retain the current specifications, requiring off-specification imports to be blended or processed so that the gas composition complies with existing limits, or to amend the current specifications to reflect more closely the expected quality of future gas supplies.
</p>

<a name="60116-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>During the course of phase 2 the department has let a variety of independent technical research contracts, and officials have worked closely with key stakeholders, to evaluate these options. The results show that treating off-specification imports is technically feasible and relatively cost-effective, but that the investment required risks deterring certain <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS27"></a>

<b>16 Jan 2006 : Column WS27</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

supplies at the gas quality margins. Alternatively, amending Great Britain&#039;s gas quality specifications could improve access to more diverse sources of supply, thus safeguarding against supply shortfalls and maintaining competition in the British gas supply market. However, introducing such changes would pose a potential threat to the safety of many gas appliances, and would risk increasing environmental emissions. Changes to Great Britain&#039;s gas quality regulations could not therefore be implemented without first undertaking a nation-wide program to manage at-risk appliances. This would be extremely expensive. The Government therefore propose to retain the current gas quality specifications and has moved to public consultation on this basis.
</p>

<a name="60116-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>During the consultation period the department plans to hold a workshop, to provide an opportunity for stakeholders to register their interest, and to brief them.
</p>

<a name="60116-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>I shall report to the House in due course on the outcome of this consultation and on the timetable for the remainder of the exercise.
</p>

<a name="60116-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>This exercise has been developed by the DTI as a member of the Sustainable Energy Policy Network (SEPN) which is working to deliver the Energy White Paper <i>Our Energy Future&#151;creating a low carbon economy</i>.

<p><a name="wa_qn_1"></a>
<a name="60116w01_wqn1"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_1"></a>Whether the nature of the six-year commitment undertaken by 16 year-olds on joining the Armed Forces is compatible with obligations of the United Kingdom under the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.  [HL3104]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_2"></a>
<a name="60116w01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  The six-year commitment is a term of service that applies to the Army. It provides that all recruits over 18 years old who enlist into the Army sign up to a minimum of four years with the right to give 12 months&#039; notice at the three-year point. Those aged under 18, however, only have their reckonable service taken from their 18th birthday. Therefore, if a young man or woman enlisted on their 16th birthday, for instance, he/she could serve a minimum of six years, comprising two years under-18 service and four years of adult service, before leaving the Army by giving 12 months&#039; notice at what for them would be the five-year point.
</p>

<a name="60116w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>The UK ratified the optional protocol (OP) on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict on 24 June 2003. In so doing the UK agreed that it would take all feasible measures to ensure that members of the Armed Forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities. The UK    made another declaration upon ratification concerning the minimum age of recruitment (age 16, in line with minimum school-leaving age) and on the safeguards to ensure that all recruitment of under-18s is genuinely voluntary and with informed consent of the volunteer and his/her parents.

</p>

<a name="60116w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>Although the six-year commitment predates the ratification of the OP, it is consistent with it. There are adequate safeguards in place to ensure that young servicemen or women under the age of 18 years may, if they wish, leave the services before committing to adult service, and that any commitment to adult service is both considered and voluntary.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>This is done through the Armed Forces operating a policy whereby all new recruits, regardless of age, have a right of discharge within the first six months of service by giving not less than 14 days notice in writing to the commanding officer if they decide that the Armed Forces is not a career for them. In addition, service personnel under 18 years three months who have passed their statutory six-month period for &quot;discharge as of right&quot;, and have registered, before reaching their 18th birthday, clear &quot;unhappiness&quot; at their choice of career, can request permission to leave the Armed Forces. This provision does not provide &quot;discharge as of right&quot; and the commanding officer has discretion to delay a decision on discharge if he has doubts about the permanence of the individual&#039;s unhappiness. However, it is exceedingly rare for such an &quot;unhappy&quot; individual to be refused permission to leave.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>The most relevant provision of the Convention on the Rights of the Child concerned the recruitment of children aged 15 into the Armed Forces. This convention predates, and was largely superseded by, the provisions of the OP. The Government consider that the safeguards provide sufficient protection to under-18s serving in the UK&#039;s Armed Forces and sufficiently comply with the UK&#039;s obligations under the convention. Similarly, the Government consider that the safeguards in terms of service of under-18s in the Armed Forces sufficiently comply with the United Kingdom&#039;s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.

<a name="60116w02_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Not all organisations will be equipped to check biometric information against the national identity register and it is envisaged that simple visual verification may be used in low-risk transactions or where the individual has an established history with the organisation checking identity. However, where that happens there will be other methods in place to verify the authenticity of an identity card. Accredited user organisations which do not have biometric readers may use card readers which can verify the card&#039;s validity and authenticity electronically against the register. This will guard against the misuse of lost or stolen cards. In addition, in the absence of a biometric check, it will be possible to request the individual to submit a password or personal identification number (PIN) with their identity card.
