<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spopq0"></A><B> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their policy towards the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Libertad) Bill currently being considered by the United States Congress.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  My Lords, we have lobbied hard both unilaterally and with our European Union partners and others against the proposed legislation. Recent amendments to the Helms Bill appear to go some way to meet our concerns about the extraterritorial aspects. We shall continue to lobby to ensure that all our concerns are met.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that extremely helpful Answer, but is she aware that many organisations and people in this country who have long been concerned about Latin America consider that the United States policy towards Cuba has been flawed for a very long time and that this piece of legislation is a classic example of that? Furthermore, is it not to their great credit that Her Majesty's Government are maintaining excellent relations with Cuba and that our current trade with that country is developing extremely satisfactorily?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I certainly agree with my noble friend's view. The original Helms Bill contained elements which were objectionable in view of UK trading interests. We shall study the new version carefully and if that new version seeks to extend the US embargo to others, we shall take appropriate action. We have always believed that constructive engagement with Cuba is the best way to encourage reform. I am delighted that there was a growth of 90 per cent. in our trade with Cuba between 1993 and 1994, although it was from a very low base. I am glad to say that not only did my noble friend Lady Young lead a 37-strong delegation to Cuba this February, but that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry will visit that country with businessmen this September.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister undertake to take our concerns directly to President Clinton, who holds a possible veto in this matter? However, in the event of that draconian and non-productive Bill becoming law, will Her Majesty's Government advise UK individuals and companies to ignore the effect, as with the Torricelli Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I cannot promise the noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, that I shall see President Clinton. I do not know whether he would see <P>


<a name="column_1888"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1888</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>me. However, I can promise the noble Viscount one thing: should those Bills be passed, we would consider making a further order under the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980. That would counteract any extraterritorial provisions in such legislation. We shall take action if those Bills go through without being amended sufficiently.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in the rather colourful jacket that she is wearing today, President Clinton would most certainly be able to see her? Is the Minister further aware that everything that she has said today carries the full support of the Opposition? Does she agree in particular that it is already deeply offensive that too many aspects of extraterritorial jurisdiction have been applied by successive American Administrations, without having them added to by this further proposal which seems to run completely counter to the rules of the World Trade Organisation? Does the Minister agree?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether it is the fact that I am wearing a red jacket that is leading to me getting such approval from the Opposition Front Bench. All that I can say is that I am glad that we are at one on this sensible view that we have taken. Our bilateral aid memoire to the United States Administration showed that there would be a prima facie breach of the US GATT obligations if that Bill were to become law. We continue to lobby with other European Union states, Japan, Canada, Mexico and other US trading partners. The French presidency of the European Union has written, as has the European Commissioner. We shall continue that lobbying because we believe that it is only sensible so to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mayhew: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the Government's attitude deserves widespread support? May we hope that in the future American policy not only on Cuba, but on Ireland and in Palestine, will pay greater regard to the views of her allies and less to her ethnic minorities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I very much agree with the noble Lord. I hope also that the battle that we fought, and won, with regard to American policy towards Vietnam will in future lead America to take more notice of the views of her allies because, with regard to Vietnam, and a number of other places in addition to those mentioned by the noble Lord, I believe that a little help from her allies might help the United States to have a more consistent policy.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Earl Ferrers): </B>  My Lords, during 1993 561,355 motor vehicles were exported from the United Kingdom.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Orr-Ewing: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that that Answer will give the country a very good feeling? We have made tremendous progress, possibly because Japan found this country a very good base for its production for western Europe. Is it not true that not only does western Europe now take 55 per cent. of our exports, but that we are even exporting cars to Japan? Is not that a fact?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for drawing attention to what is indeed a great achievement. In 1984, we exported 86,000 cars to Europe; in 1993, we exported 465,000 cars. In 1984, we exported 883 cars to Japan; in 1993, we exported 17,557 cars. It is not without interest that over 1,000 cars are exported from Nissan in Sunderland each year back to Japan.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it would have been a greater achievement if that industry had continued in British ownership?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, it may have escaped the noble Lord that almost all large motor manufacturing companies are multinational companies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Clark of Kempston: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the economic policy which the Government are pursuing is responsible for the huge increase in exports, not only of motor cars, but in every other export field?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew13"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is entirely correct. That would not have happened had it not been for the policies carried out by Her Majesty's Government, particularly with regard to privatisation and getting out of the web of nationalisation with all its restrictions. Despite the fact that the party opposite has done away with Clause IV, it hangs on to nationalisation as much as it can. My noble friend is entirely correct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, now that the Minister has got that out of his system, will he complete the picture by telling us how many cars were imported during the year in question?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew15"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am surprised that the noble Lord thought that I had got it out of my system. That was merely the beginning. I am more than happy to give the noble Lord version two if he asks the right question. It is only because my noble friend was sensible enough to ask a question for which I was not prepared that I was entirely happy to give the answer I did. The fact is that a number of vehicles are imported. In 1984, 1,020 vehicles were imported from Japan. The figure is now 999,000, which is less. That is a matter which will appeal at least to the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend say how many motor sport products are exported?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew17"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, 40 per cent. of British motor sport sales are exports. The annual revenue in that respect is &#163;1 billion. Some 50,000 people are employed. <P>


<a name="column_1890"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1890</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It is an extraordinary fact, I think, that in the Indianapolis 500 motor races last year every car but one was built in Britain.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, while I am very happy to hear the good news, will the Minister confirm that much of it relates to the fact that the Prime Minister wants to be at the heart of the European Union? Does that remain the policy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew19"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, that is an extraordinary question coming from the noble Lord. The answer is yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may say how pleased I am to hear the Minister revealing the caring side of his nature by looking up the figures for his noble friend Lord Orr-Ewing, which are published and freely available. He could have looked them up in the Library. When he was looking them up for his noble friend did he notice in which year car exports from this country were at a maximum? Will he confirm that the figure was over 800,000 in 1969? Does he care to recall which government were in power that year? Would he also like to notice a later figure when exports were at their absolute minimum, which was 1986? Would he like to reflect upon which government were in power in that year?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, that is not a bad try from the noble Lord. As he has just ribbed my noble friend for asking questions to which he could know the answer, I cannot think why the noble Lord, Lord Peston, asks me questions to which he knows the answers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that he complimented, quite rightly, the management which helped to create those figures but that the engineers and skilled workmen, with the essential agreements brought about by their trade unions, also deserve a mention?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord always asks the most anodyne of questions. The answer is that I agree with him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew3"></A><B> The Viscount of Falkland: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister prepared to acknowledge the growing contribution of this country's newly reconstituted motor cycle industry, notably Triumph, which is exporting as many motor cycles now as it can make?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Viscount for making a contribution of considerably greater help than the one made by his noble friend Lord Mackie of Benshie who seems to have vanished now that he has divested himself of his question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Orr-Ewing: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that in the last figure he gave I think the decimal point had slipped three times? He is not alone in that. Winston Churchill and Alec Home both had trouble with their damned dots.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I shall have to look at Hansard. I am not aware of a decimal point dropped or moved three places. I am greatly disturbed by what my noble friend says, but I am not referring to the question he asked.

<P>
<UL>Why they will not set up a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the recent sale of their shares in PowerGen Plc.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Henley): </B>  My Lords, there is no case for a public inquiry. The Treasury is pursuing the further work suggested by the Stock Exchange concerning the circumstances surrounding the GENCO 2 sale. Sir Terence Burns will respond in substance to the Stock Exchange and the response will be published.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that response. There are some worrying aspects about the sale. Does the Minister agree that, because the Treasury is an interested party in this matter, a public inquiry would be more in keeping with open government and be seen to be more independent and more rigorous, and would ensure that all aspects of the matter were aired?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is being over-simplistic. Matters relating to this issue have been explained by the Government on a number of occasions, and in particular by my right honourable friend the Financial Secretary, who informed the House of those matters last week. As I said in my original Answer, the Stock Exchange wrote to the Treasury and suggested that a Treasury inquiry would be appropriate. That is why the Treasury is taking forward urgently the work suggested by the Stock Exchange. We have asked a senior official within the Treasury, who was not associated with the original work, to carry out that inquiry. As I said in my first reply, we will publish the response when we send it to the Stock Exchange.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, is it not the case that the Question shows that the noble Lord who asked it was suffering from that most distressing and almost universal complaint of "inquiryitis"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I cannot speak for the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, on how he wishes to ask his Question. But people often jump to the idea of having a public inquiry at far too early a stage. As I said, a proper inquiry will be conducted by the Treasury and the results of that inquiry will be published.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Wyatt of Weeford: </B>   My Lords, I must declare an interest. I bought some of these shares. Is the Minister aware that, since the original issue price, the shares have agreeably gone up in value, and that the only people who have suffered are the speculators who expected to make a very quick profit on the first few days of trading? They did not. But now all who, like myself, bought them as a long-term investment are extremely satisfied with the agreeable increase in price.

<P>

<A NAME="50615-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely correct. I should like to congratulate him on his financial acumen.

<A NAME="50615-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Eatwell: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall that, in his Statement to another place on 9th June, Sir George Young stated:

<P>

<a name="50615-02_para0"></a>Will the Minister confirm that the legal advice was received from the firm of Slaughter and May? Will he tell the House whether, as I am reliably informed, before receiving the opinion of Slaughter and May, the predominant legal opinion in the Treasury was that the prospectus should be changed?

<P>

<A NAME="50615-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord will be well aware, we do not comment upon our legal advice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Eatwell: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister answer the second part of my question? Before the receipt of independent legal advice, was the predominant legal opinion within the Treasury that this prospectus should be changed? Is that true or false? Yes or no?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, my answer does not change. We acted on legal advice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew17"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister telling the House that the Government are like the former servant who brandished an open testimonial which said, "During his period of service with me, Mr. So and So has discharged his duties entirely to his own satisfaction"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl makes a very silly point. As I made clear, we are responding to the Stock Exchange, which suggested that an internal inquiry by the Treasury would be appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, are the Government saying that there is something wrong with the sale of these shares, but that the Government are not to blame because of the advice that they received, or are they saying that there is nothing wrong with the sale of the shares?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, we have made it clear that we believe that we have acted absolutely appropriately on all occasions, but we have been asked by the Stock Exchange to conduct an inquiry. As it has so asked us, we have said we will. We are doing it in the manner in which the Stock Exchange has asked us to do it.

<A NAME="50615-02_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Scottish Office   (Lord Fraser of Carmyllie): </B>  My Lords, in the three years up to 31st March 1994 the total cost to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom of prescriptions for family health services was &#163;3,626 million, &#163;4,089 million and &#163;4,491 million respectively. The income from the charges was <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>&#163;259 million, &#163;290 million and &#163;318 million and over 80 per cent. of prescription items were dispensed free of charge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. He said that more than 80 per cent. of prescription items are free but today many prescription items cost more under the National Health Service than they cost to buy over the counter. Furthermore, prescription items are free for anyone over the official retiring age, which does not apply to dental charges. In view of those facts, is it not time that the whole question of who pays, and at what cost, should be looked at again? That would give us the benefit of prescribing new, improving and expensive drugs rather than seeing a great deal of public money spent on drugs which cost less than the money paid by the health service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to undertake such a review. It is important that some 80 per cent. of items are prescribed free of charge. Nevertheless, the money received from charges is substantial and the National Health Service can put it to good use. Particular items might cost less than the National Health Service prescription charge and it is open to the individual to acquire them by way of private prescriptions. However, I counsel those who consider taking that route to examine carefully whether at the end of the day it would be cheaper for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-02_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the anomaly whereby patients with certain medical conditions which require continuous replacement therapy&#151;for example, diabetics and people with thyroid deficiency&#151;but who are not exempt from prescription charges for any other condition can obtain free of charge not only the drugs that they require for their qualifying medical condition but tranquillisers and so forth, whereas other patients who are suffering from conditions which need continuous treatment&#151;for example, those with high blood pressure&#151;can obtain no drugs free of charge? Does not the Minister believe that it is time for a review of the whole system?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, no. Clearly, the situation is not without its complications but I would not suggest that we should be extending the range of conditions to which exemption applies. Those who have a medical condition may wish to take advantage of the prescription prepayment certificates. Those in the United Kingdom who have done so have, on average, recouped their outlay approximately three times over. I am sure that the noble Lord will recognise that, if one tried to exempt those items required only for the treatment of the qualifying condition, an extremely complicated set of arrangements would follow, with whitelists and blacklists and doctors having to make difficult decisions about whether the particular prescription was attributable to the qualifying condition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Robson of Kiddington: </B>   My Lords, we have heard that some drugs cost less to buy over the counter than on prescription and the fact that a patient can ask for a private prescription prepayment certificate. Would it not <P>


<a name="column_1894"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1894</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be easier for the pharmacist to be given the right to dispense the prescribed item at its correct price instead of charging the prescription price?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, as I have indicated, that can be achieved by using the private prescription. One must look at the matter most carefully. There is an assumption that because the drug might be acquired at a cheaper rate by the National Health Service the price would necessarily be cheaper for the private individual going into the pharmacist. The situation is not as simple as is sometimes portrayed. I believe that it is important to continue with the system that we have. There may be casual circumstances in which people need a prescription but if they need it on a repeat basis they are probably better to use the prepayment arrangement, even if the required item costs less than the NHS prescription charge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that most GPs, under the terms of their service agreements, feel unable to issue the so-called private prescriptions? If the Government are anxious to see the increased use of that system, will they alter GPs' service agreements in order that they can issue prescriptions that are less costly than those of the NHS?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, that arrangement is already in place. I have been anxious to establish the fact that this matter should be approached with caution. If the individual has repeat prescriptions, he might be better placed to take the opportunity of using the prescription prepayment arrangement, even if the individual item costs less than the current standing charge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to come back on this matter but the Minister may have misunderstood me. I understand the professional and legal advice to GPs to be that they should not issue the so-called private prescriptions within the terms of their service agreements. I consulted the BMA on the matter this morning and I believe that the understanding of GPs is that in order to do so legitimately their service agreements would have to be changed. Will the Government do that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, I was not aware of that view of the BMA. I understand that GPs can issue such private prescriptions but it is certainly the case that they are under no obligation to do so.

<A NAME="50615-03_spnew7"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I have had considerable correspondence with the department on that very subject and I have come to the same conclusion as he has? But there is a problem with dispensing doctors. Dispensing doctors can write a private prescription but they are not allowed to dispense that prescription to their patients. That puts the patients of such doctors on an unequal footing with other patients. Will the Minister ensure that something is done about that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, there is not a next Question&#151;this is the last Question on the Order Paper! I agree with the Minister that the matter should be approached with caution because it is an emotive subject. Nevertheless, I wish to press the point because he said that more than 80 per cent. of prescription items are dispensed free of charge. Even if the item you require costs only &#163;1, if you have free prescriptions you would still like it on a National Health Service prescription because it would save whatever the amount may be. Can the system be reviewed so that, in the case of an item which is worth only &#163;1 and is available over the counter for that amount, a patient entitled to a free prescription will still cost the NHS only &#163;1 instead of the full dispensing amount of &#163;5? Or does the Minister believe that such a system would so endanger the pharmacy industry that that factor should perhaps be taken into consideration? That is why I suggest that the matter should be investigated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, the assumption underlying the question is that the only cost to be considered is the cost of the drug. Clearly, administering the system of prescriptions throughout the United Kingdom is expensive. The cost to be considered is not only the cost of the drug but administration and other dispensing fees.

<P>

<a name="50615-03_para8"></a>Clause 7 [Exemption for small businesses]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham </B>   moved Amendment No. 52A:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 5, line 21, at beginning insert ("Until 1st April 1997,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-03_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: This part of the Bill deals with employment matters and, in particular, it excludes small firms with fewer than 20 employees from the provisions of the Bill. I understand that subsequent amendments are to be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, which propose bringing small firms within the remit of the Bill on a phased timescale. Obviously, in the absence of anything else, we support that.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para10"></a>However, Amendment No. 52A would not allow small firms to be exempt after 1st April 1997. In other words, after 12 months small firms, alongside large firms, would come within the framework of the Bill. They would not be allowed to discriminate against disabled employees where the disability was not relevant to the job or where accommodation for the disability could be made at reasonable expense.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para11"></a>Small firms represent some 35 per cent. of the labour market, or 17 per cent. if the self-employed are excluded. They represent something like 96 per cent. of all businesses. They are the fastest-growing sector of the economy. Between 1979 and 1986, 750,000 small businesses were formed in this country. In particular in the rural economy&#151;for example, Devon, Norfolk and Wales&#151;it is difficult to find any businesses which employ more than 20 people. Almost by definition, larger businesses tend to be in more urban areas. Therefore, to exclude small businesses with fewer than 20 employees means that for large swathes of the country, when disabled people seek work, they will be without the protection offered by this Bill. Is that reasonable? Why should they be excluded?
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para12"></a>The figure of 20&#151;firms employing fewer than 20 employees&#151;was imported from the old quota system established in 1944 when the nature of the business structure in this country was very different. That was obviously because, on rounding down, firms with fewer than 20 employees would come to less than one full-time employee, and the 3 per cent. meant that 20 was a good and effective rough and ready figure.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para13"></a>But that has not applied in subsequent legislation. For example, in race legislation there is no minimum quota figure. Major health and safety legislation applies to all firms, irrespective of their size. The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 began by excluding firms with fewer than five employees and I understand that that exclusion has now been abolished.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para14"></a>Therefore, is it reasonable to exclude small firms with fewer than 20 employees? What are the arguments in favour of it? The first argument which the Government advanced in the other place is that to adapt companies for disabled people's employment is expensive and therefore that would be an unacceptable burden on small businesses; and as small businesses are the seedcorn of the future it is unreasonable to burden them with additional and bureaucratic expenses which they can ill afford and which may therefore strangle their development.
<P>


<a name="column_1897"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1897</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para15"></a>On this side of the Committee we are as anxious as all Members of the Committee to see small businesses flourish. But the costs of adaptation to allow employment of disabled people have often been wildly exaggerated. In the United States, two-thirds of all companies made adaptations which cost less than 500 dollars. It has been estimated by employers that the average adaptation of a company to allow full physical access for disabled people is on average &#163;200. That is the kind of burden that we are talking about. That is the average cost to make small companies physically accessible for disabled people.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para16"></a>What of the secondary costs which small businesses fear&#151;not just the cost of physical adaptations but the personnel costs? I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, mentioned those on an earlier debate; for example, the time off required for sickness, medical appointments or for coverage. That point was addressed by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, who said that, overall, disabled people have better and more reliable employment records than non-disabled people. A 1990 Devon careers study showed that 93 per cent. of employers found that disabled people performed as well as or better than able-bodied people. They had fought harder for the job and were determined to keep it. Moreover, 45 per cent. of employers found the attitude to work of disabled people was as good as that of able-bodied people and 55 per cent. found that it was better. Therefore, only a tiny fraction found the attitude to work of disabled people less acceptable than that of able-bodied people.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para17"></a>As regards attendance&#151;the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain&#151;70 per cent. of employers found the attendance of disabled people equally good and 26 per cent. found it to be better than that of average able-bodied people. In other words, only 4 per cent. found that there was a problem in relation to personnel issues.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para18"></a>Therefore, the financial costs to provide access are on average about &#163;200, which in any event is covered by "reasonable cost", and the personnel costs of disability are not shown to create the problems which it is perhaps perceived that they do. On the contrary, the attendance, regularity and reliability of disabled people on the whole is better than able-bodied people and those arguments in relation to small businesses are therefore simply not valid. Consequently, the argument to exclude small businesses because we would be imposing an unreasonable cost on them if they were to fall within the framework of the Bill is not true. It does not exist in relation to physical adaptations of premises or in relation to personnel. If we stopped thinking of disabled people as a burden but instead thought of widening the opportunities for employers to invest in human capital, it is clear that disabled people are a very sound investment indeed.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para19"></a>The second argument relates to the views of small businesses. The Government's Red Book, which has a summary of responses at Table 26, shows that, of 250 organisations which commented, 200 did not wish to see small firms excluded from the provisions of the Bill. Within that, six voluntary organisations would go along with excluding small firms but 59 would not. Four local authorities would go along with the exemption but 43 would not. Of course, when one talks about local <P>


<a name="column_1898"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1898</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authorities one must think of contract compliance and cost centres. There are very small subsections within local authorities in relation to which the fewer-than-20 rule would apply. Of the employers who responded, one employer would wish to see small firms excluded and 10 would not. The rest were so concerned about the issue that they did not bother to respond to the question.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para20"></a>Therefore, only one employer favoured the exclusion of small companies while the rest favoured their inclusion or were indifferent. Therefore, evidence from the consultation exercise does not show that small businesses need to be excluded because they are asking for that. It will not be costly and small businesses are not calling for that exemption.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para21"></a>The Government may say that the responses are all from larger firms like the CBI and that "they would call for it, wouldn't they?" It is worth reminding ourselves that over 50 per cent. of the companies that the CBI represents, including the trade associations of small companies, have fewer than 20 employees. Therefore, when the CBI and the Employers Forum on Disability call for small firms to come within the Act they are speaking for their constituency which includes small businesses. We believe that it is not right that a disabled person's access to employment should depend on who employs him and where he lives, as will be the case if the Bill passes unamended.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para22"></a>Nonetheless, we still support the fall-back amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. However, we have been swayed on one side by a consideration which was brought to our attention by the Employers Forum on Disability and by the CBI. All organisations are protected from having to make adaptations which are unreasonably costly. If small firms were excluded altogether at this stage, then what counts as unreasonably costly would be determined by the firms to which the Act would initially apply. Those are the larger firms; that is, those with over 20 employees. When, five or 10 years on, as would be the case under the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, smaller firms were required to make similar adjustments, the concept of reasonableness would have been determined by the larger firms through litigation and through the courts of law and smaller companies would have lost their voice. We believe that that could be to their disadvantage.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para23"></a>It would be much better for smaller firms to be in with the larger firms from the beginning as regards determining what counts as reasonable cost, reasonable access to premises and reasonable personnel costs. I believe that all those factors should be considered together. Therefore, given that fact and given that, in all the circumstances, no firm is asked to do anything that is unreasonably expensive, we do not believe that small firms should be excluded from the Bill. We do not believe that they need the double protection both of reasonable cost and of size. However, we do believe that they may continue to exhibit discriminatory practices unless they are required to comply with the law. We also believe that small companies which want to employ disabled people may fear that they will be undercut competitively without such inclusion.
<P>

<a name="50615-03_para24"></a>We believe that there is no justification, when one explores the matter in detail, for excluding small firms from the Bill. On average, the cost of physical adaptations <P>


<a name="column_1899"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1899</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is only &#163;200. They can well afford that. The costs of personnel are not evident; on the contrary, all the evidence that we have shows that disabled people produce more effective, reliable and cost-free services. Finally, all the evidence suggests that small firms are not calling for such an exclusion. Given that fact, let us bring them into the frame from the beginning and ensure that disabled people have full access to employment irrespective of who they work for and where they live. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   I am in general agreement with the remarks so eloquently made by the noble Baroness. The amendment would have the effect of postponing the whole of Clause 7 for at least a year. Firms employing fewer than 20 people were excluded under the 1944 Act&#151;and, indeed, have been for the past 50 years&#151;from the quota system. Therefore, we are now considering changes to the quota system which many of us knew would have to be carried out.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para0"></a>As the noble Baroness said, small firms would have had to have been employing 0.04 of a person, or something like that, under the quota system. Clearly, that was not practical. However, small firms are an important sector of the employing community. We are now dealing with a legacy of the quota system. I shall not repeat what I said on Second Reading, but, with the new system being proposed in the Bill, I consider that small establishments should be included in due course, if not now.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para1"></a>Judging from the amendments with which we shall deal later, it is clear that there is a general feeling that some postponement may be necessary but that, in due course, smaller firms should be brought in. In certain circumstances, it may be more difficult for a small firm to make the changes and to expend the money required to employ a disabled person. But, with the principle of reasonableness and reasonable adjustments which runs through the whole of the Bill&#151;and, incidentally, ran through the American equivalent&#151;surely that consideration would be taken into account when a small-firm situation was being considered.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para2"></a>The quota system could not be enforced because only about 1 per cent. of the working population in the country have been registered as disabled people. Therefore, not all of the large employers could possibly achieve the 3 per cent. quota. That is a mathematical fact. I believe that I am politically correct in saying that only a numeracy challenged person would not accept that fact.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para3"></a>We must now consider why disabled people did not register and hope that that will not continue to be the case under the new system. Indeed, we must do everything in the future to encourage disabled people to register. The noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, and I have disagreed in the past on the matter. In the debate on 22nd May, the noble Lord said that he was blaming Ministers and not the quota system for the fact that the quota could not be reached. He then said that that was the only political comment he would make during his speech.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para4"></a>However, the noble Lord was being unfair to himself. He was not making a party political point. Why? Well, the noble Lord himself had been making exactly the same criticism of Labour Ministers in the other place before <P>


<a name="column_1900"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1900</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>1979. For example, during Question Time in 1978 on July 4th (at col. 215 of Hansard) he made the same criticism. Indeed, the situation has been going on for years; namely, that fewer than 3 per cent.&#151;that is, well under 3 per cent.&#151;of the labour force have been registered as disabled. The Minister at the time, a Mr. Grant, as recalled in Hansard, replied again that it was impossible for firms to employ 3 per cent. and meet the quota because far fewer than 3 per cent. had been registered as disabled. Therefore, the noble Lord was not making a party political point because he had been attacking Ministers on both sides.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para5"></a>My object in reminding Members of the Committee about the latter is to point out that the situation has existed for many years under both kinds of government. The quota could not be enforced because too few disabled people allowed themselves to be registered. Many of them thought that registration would brand them as inadequate and that they would do better by not being disabled, or being branded as such, and remaining outside of the scheme. So the quota scheme pointed in the right direction and provided a target. The difficulty was that the target could not be reached and therefore could not be enforced.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para6"></a>On the question of registration, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, in a report dated March 1994, discussed at page 33 this most important point. The report stated that disabled people gave,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"several reasons for regarding the 1944 Act as not just inadequate, but potentially detrimental".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para7"></a>The writers of the report were of the view that we must make changes to the system. They went on to point out that there was a "dilemma" for disabled people:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Should they register in order to obtain the benefits that registration offers, or does the potential discrimination they may face outweigh any supposed advantages of registration?"</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para8"></a>That sums up the problem that has existed for over 20 years. Despite this falling short of the original intention of 50 years ago, some will be sorry to see the quota scheme being replaced, for example MENCAP. The noble Lord, Lord Rix, is in his place and I am sure he will agree with me that MENCAP&#151;that is the organisation dealing with those who have learning disabilities&#151;has found it useful, although it also realises that the target and enforcement were not possible.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para9"></a>I remind the Committee that the 1944 Act was passed during the war mainly to cater for war-disabled people, large numbers of young men in their twenties, including me, who had their working lives ahead of them and who were disadvantaged by disabling injuries incurred in World War II. Their numbers have been dwindling and now almost all, if not all, are past retirement age. The system introduced by the 1944 Act performed well&#151;not only the quota scheme but other parts of the Act&#151;over many years and in the tasks intended. The situation today is different and radical changes are needed. In making changes small businesses can be included, in my opinion, in future provided the principle of reasonableness prevails.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   I want to stun the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, by saying that I propose to agree with him on a number of points he has made, as distinct from the usual controversies and arguments between us. In the first place the noble Lord is quite right when he <P>


<a name="column_1901"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1901</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>implies that my remark the other day was not, as I said, a party political comment because he is quite right that not only Conservative Ministers but also Labour Ministers have not been enforcing the quota. It is perfectly proper and right to say that. A number of us have been campaigning both against a Conservative Government and a Labour Government both of whom were failing to ensure that disabled people were served properly by enforcing the quota.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, spoke about people being numerically challenged. I would like to argue with him on that but I cannot do so because my wife says that I am numerically challenged. When I try to argue with her about bills or anything else she insists that I am numerically challenged. Therefore I had better not take issue with the noble Lord on that. However, my stand on the quota is that we need to retain it because this Bill is by no means an adequate substitute as it stands. We want to strengthen it. We need to register&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, referred to that&#151;the number of unemployed disabled people and the number seeking work. But, basically, on this issue of small firms having an undue burden imposed on them, I simply do not see how anyone on the government side can claim that they must exclude firms with under 20 workers because the burden would be an undue and unfair one. That is wholly illogical because under the basic, fundamental, unambiguous terms of the Bill it is impossible to damage small firms.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para11"></a>I am glad to see that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is in his place because he is always able to quote chapter and verse on particular Bills and amendments. On page 5 of the Bill, Clause 6(7) states specifically that regulations may make provision,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as to circumstances in which it is reasonable for an employer to have to take steps".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para12"></a>There is also a provision as regards regulations on cost. Therefore the matter of unreasonable costs is quite out of the question. The terms of the Bill prohibit unreasonable costs. Therefore no Minister can legitimately argue that unreasonable costs will be imposed on small firms.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para13"></a>I am sure that in this Chamber and the other place the argument that we cannot afford a measure has been used since time immemorial. I am sure that such an argument was used at the time when people were trying to abolish the slave trade and the employment of young chimney sweeps. I am sure it was argued that we could not afford to do that. It is an argument that is inapplicable to this Bill especially in view of the Government's own assessment that the average cost of compliance would only be about &#163;200. Even if there was this cost, I remind the Committee that this Bill is about unjustified discrimination. Many Members of the Committee will remember the words in the report of the Committee on Restrictions Against Disabled People (CORAD). The classic phrase was:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are not trying to get blind bus drivers or deaf piano tuners jobs".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para14"></a>That is a marvellous phrase. It encapsulates all that we are not trying to do.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para15"></a>We are trying to outlaw only unjustified discrimination. In many cases it is simply prejudice that prevents disabled people from doing jobs of which they are just as capable as able-bodied people. I see no reason why small <P>


<a name="column_1902"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1902</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>firms should be allowed to indulge their prejudices, especially when large firms cannot do so. In any case when changes are made by these firms under this Bill when it becomes an Act, government assistance will be available. We have already said that the Government's access to work scheme is of tremendous help to these firms. That will help small firms and in most cases there will be no cost to them. I know that some Members of the Committee opposite may argue that some small firms will be unable to compete if they are included in the terms of this Bill. All I can say is that the provisions would be imposed on all firms so that no particular firm would have a specific advantage.
<P>

<a name="50615-04_para16"></a>Finally, if Ministers claim that small firms will be asked to observe a code of practice, I would add that this Bill is aimed at the unscrupulous small firms which are trying to evade their responsibilities and who discriminate, either wilfully or inadvertently. They are the very firms which will not be impressed by a code of practice. The majority of firms which are good firms will accept a code of practice; the bad firms will not. That is why we need this requirement to include all firms regardless of their size.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I am not convinced by the argument on costs. As I stated the night before last, the access to work scheme, which has been a great success and has helped 10,000 people, cost &#163;14.6 million, which is an average of &#163;1,460 per person employed. The figure of &#163;200 has been batted about. If the figure were &#163;200, I am sure that small firms would not have a problem on the cost side. However, it does not give me much comfort when we talk about reasonable costs for two reasons: the first is that "reasonable" is not defined&#151;&#163;1,500 could be a reasonable sum to one small firm whereas it could be absolutely crippling to another.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para0"></a>We are holding in our minds a picture of a company or a firm with 20 people. What about a group of perhaps seven or eight people who have got together to create a new business? If they were lumbered&#151;I say "lumbered" advisedly&#151;with a cost of &#163;1,500, it could make the difference between either employing another person, or not going after a certain amount of business, or not succeeding. I would like some clarification from the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, about the figure of &#163;200. How would she cope with the word "reasonable" because, as I say, what is reasonable to one firm may not be reasonable to another?
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para1"></a>There is also, of course, a hidden point in that if one cannot decide what is constituted by "reasonable", it is&#151;to use my phrase&#151;a lawyer's charter. One will have to consult lawyers for them to decide what is reasonable and what is not reasonable.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para2"></a>I turn to the second point raised by the noble Baroness in relation to personnel issues. I have not seen the survey she mentioned. At Second Reading I spoke from my own personal experience. I reiterate that my experience of employing disabled people has been as I stated. It may be that I have been extremely unlucky. However, the organisation was big enough to be able to carry the costs. The disabled workers were good workers when they were present, but perhaps they were more disabled than the average disabled person questioned in the survey. I am still anxious about the <P>


<a name="column_1903"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1903</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matter. This is not a cheap point. I could give chapter and verse on individual cases, but this is obviously not the correct place to give names and addresses. I could instance specific cases of disablement, including a person who was HIV positive whose case involved an enormous amount of absence. I did not worry about that, and we had no difficulties about employing someone who was HIV positive.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para3"></a>However, if a small firm employing seven or eight people had to cope with an attendance record like that of the person I have in mind&#151;which was 65 per cent. of the working year&#151;while that was an appalling problem for the individual, it could be a crippling problem for the small firm employing him.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para4"></a>Therefore, on both of those points I should like further clarification from the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_time0"></a><H5>4 p.m.</st></H5>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   This is an important clause. The noble Baroness explained its effect in the course of indicating what she seeks to achieve with her amendment. In this clause we seek to exempt small firms because we recognise that it is likely to be more difficult and burdensome for them to get to grips with the new right and have available the advice they need in particular cases. Generally they do not have the personnel or in-house specialists who would have the time and expertise to deal with issues such as considering the statutory duty to make reasonable adjustments at the different stages of recruitment, employment and development of a disabled person.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para5"></a>At the outset I should make it clear that cost is not the only burden on a small firm. There can also be the burden of attending to the legislation and bearing it in mind. Many people who run small firms work every bit as hard, if not harder, than the people they employ. They have to seek contracts, chase up money to pay the bills and check the ordering. In addition they have to deal with all the other aspects of running a small firm involving personnel. We ought to consider whether adding this additional provision will place an additional burden on those firms.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para6"></a>It is not simply a financial matter. It is a matter of the added burdens of knowing about the legislation and coming to grips with it and the concept of making the necessary adjustments and what might be reasonable in the circumstances. That is bound to be a much greater burden for a small firm without a personnel department than for a large or medium-sized firm where there is a personnel department.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para7"></a>I should not like an impression to go out from this Chamber that we are content to see small firms treat disabled people without fair consideration, and I hope that no one will say anything that might encourage such an impression. My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State for Employment said in the other place that of course we do not want small firms to discriminate against disabled people any more than we want large firms to discriminate. Many small firms do employ disabled people. He assured the House, as he had before, that we would encourage them to follow the new code of practice. To that end we will consult them as well in drawing up the code.
<P>


<a name="column_1904"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1904</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para8"></a>It is true that the Bill as it stands covers the great majority of employees in this country. Something like 80 per cent. of employees will be covered by the Bill. So there will be many opportunities for disabled people to seek employment covered by the legislation. In addition, many small firms already happily employ disabled people and I have no doubt will continue to do so.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para9"></a>We are trying to strike a fair balance between what it is reasonable to require on behalf of disabled people and the need to avoid constraining the growth, prosperity and operation of new and existing small firms, which are so essential not only to the creation of new job opportunities but to job opportunities which already exist in the economy.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para10"></a>The noble Baroness indicated that there was no evidence that small employers wished to be excluded. The Federation of Small Businesses supports the exclusion of small firms. I believe that the federation has a better understanding of the concerns of very small firms than the CBI or the Employers Forum on Disability which, although they may contain a few small firms, are dominated by the big corporate players in the United Kingdom. Therefore we should take account of what the Federation of Small Businesses says.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para11"></a>The amendment provides for the removal of the threshold after 1st April 1997. The noble Baroness indicated that that would give small businesses a year's grace after the enactment and coming into force of the Bill for larger firms, and allow them to get to know their way round the legislation before the clause was removed and businesses, regardless of size, fell within the legislation. However, as my noble friend Lord Inglewood said on Tuesday, we shall introduce the employment provisions towards the end of next year. Thus the amendment would give people only a few months. However, that is not the basis of my argument; I merely point that out to the Committee in case anyone is tempted to think that giving small businesses a year's grace sounds like great generosity on the part of the noble Baroness. In fact, it would be markedly less than a year. Even if it were a year, I believe that it would not be generous to small firms.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para12"></a>We believe that the Bill as drafted&#151;with the amendment that I shall shortly propose to the clause&#151;represents the proper way to move forward. We shall be obliged to review the position in five years time. At that stage, if the Government thought that the legislation was working well, problems had been resolved and the air was clearer, it might be possible to begin to reduce the threshold. That is the proper way to proceed.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para13"></a>I am sure that the noble Baroness is not surprised to hear me say that I cannot accept her amendment. I understand from all that went on in the other place and the debate that we had at Second Reading that this is a matter on which the noble Baroness and other Members of the Committee feel strongly. I feel equally strongly about the need to defend the position of small businesses and ensure that we do not place any more burdens on them, whether in terms of cost or administration, than we absolutely have to. I do not know whether there is any point in my inviting the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment as I understand that she feels very <P>


<a name="column_1905"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1905</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>strongly about the matter. If and when she puts it to the test of the Lobbies I trust that my noble friends will support me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   Will the Minister be kind enough to comment on a false analogy drawn by his noble friend Lady O'Cathain when she referred to the average cost of &#163;200 and the average cost of &#163;1,500 of the access to work scheme? The figure of &#163;200 per person is the government estimate in the cost compliance statement.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para14"></a>The best way I can explain the false analogy is by way of an example. Somebody I know extremely well, who is blind, under the access to work scheme has a computer which is specially adapted for blind people. That costs &#163;9,000. In addition she has a reader's allowance of &#163;3.50 an hour for 15 hours a week. No employer, large or small, would pay such costs in order to take on a disabled employee. That is why we have an access to work scheme. The Government feel, correctly, that that is the type of cost which should be borne so that that disabled person has a job which she would not have if there were no access to work scheme.
<P>

<a name="50615-05_para15"></a>Therefore to compare the &#163;200 per person which would be spread over the small and larger adaptions, with the expensive costs of specialised equipment regarding the access to work scheme is a false analogy.

<A NAME="50615-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   Before the Minister responds to those points, will he inform the House whether it is possible for anyone to impose unreasonable burdens on small employers under the terms of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hamilton of Dalzell: </B>   The debate about costs for providing equipment to enable a disabled person to work does not describe the full costs to a small business of employing a disabled person. I am involved in the farming business. Nowadays we never specify what the worker will be employed to do because, in a small, struggling business&#151;many such companies have gone out of business during the recent recession&#151;it is essential that everyone should be prepared to turn their hands to anything. Therefore, even if a worker is equipped specifically to do one single job, it does not always suit small businesses to have someone so employed. The employee might have to turn his hand to some other task. If his movement, or whatever it might be, is restricted, he might not be able to comply. However, it would be interesting to have a statistic on how many disabled people are employed by small businesses. I believe that we should find that many are so employed.

<A NAME="50615-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   First, I thank noble Lords for taking part in the debate and welcome the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy. He made an important point for us about the problems generated by the quota scheme involving an artificial constraint. It is much better to have a comprehensive and inclusive approach so far as is reasonable. I believe that those were his words. I entirely agree with him. I do not wish for one moment to dissociate myself from the Government's position of reasonableness. It would <P>


<a name="column_1906"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1906</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be foolish to close down companies by putting on them burdens which make them buckle under. That would clearly be unreasonable. Therefore the noble Lord's position and ours are very much shared.
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, referred to costs. I realise that she has much experience in this field regarding disabled people. Does she accept that my noble friend Lord Carter addressed her point? The extra and special costs tend to be funded by the access to work scheme. That is a government cost. The figure of &#163;200 was the Government's own estimate of the average cost of modest adaptions to premises which would be required. I give way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   If it were stated that the costs involved in employing a disabled person in a company of 20 or fewer employees would be only &#163;200, that might be acceptable. However, the fact is that the cost is open ended. The noble Baroness has already stated that we do not wish to see firms buckle under. But there could well be a real problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That is a helpful and constructive response. We share the same objective, which suggests that the answer is empirical. We have evidence not only from Devon, but from Norfolk firms which I consulted on the matter through the county council's rights officer which confirms the Devon experience. There is a distinction between disability and sickness. Disability tends to be a constant and predictable state. Sickness may be a more fluctuating condition which generates additional personnel costs. However, for the large majority, a disability or an impairment is more likely to be relatively constant. Experience in Devon and in Norfolk suggests that not only the financial costs but the personnel costs of employing disabled people are entirely acceptable; and that, far from being a burden on companies, those people have proved to be a form of sound investment because they stay with the company. They do not seek other jobs; they do not move on as they receive additional training; and they feed that training back into the company so that everyone gains.
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para1"></a>Associated with that factor was the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton of Dalzell, as to how many companies employ whom. The best figures that I have are these. Of those companies which employ fewer than 10 employees, 15 per cent. employ a person with a disability. Of those which employ fewer than 50 employees, 30 per cent. have a disabled employee. In the other tranches, the majority of companies will employ disabled people. Therefore it is clear that, for the most part, disabled people do not find their way into small companies. For example, of companies which employ more than 200 people, 76 per cent. employ disabled people, compared with 15 per cent. of companies employing fewer than 10 people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Perhaps I may be helpful. As I said in my main speech, I should not like the message to go out that small firms do not employ disabled people. Nor would I like it to go out that somehow or other the legislation means that such companies can almost discriminate against them; quite the contrary.
<P>


<a name="column_1907"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1907</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para2"></a>Regarding small firms defined as employing fewer than 20 employees, I am advised that research suggests that somewhere between 25 per cent. and 30 per cent. of disabled employees work in small firms as I have defined them. That seems a considerable number of people, given the fact that 80 per cent. of employees work in firms above that size.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention. It makes our case for us. If 30 per cent. of firms with fewer than 20 employees can and do employ disabled people, it is clearly a question of coming to terms with modest physical adaptions and the education and information required. Then those firms may freely go on. If such firms can do so, why cannot the other 70 per cent? If smaller firms have almost the same record as medium-sized firms, why do we need to give them the double protection of exclusion as well as reasonable cost?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I should learn never to seek to be helpful to the noble Baroness. However, there is a huge difference between a small firm deciding of its own free will in the current circumstances to try to do its best to employ a disabled person and the employer (the owner of a small firm) having to go to all the trouble of knowing, understanding and applying this Bill, which will become an Act. That is the main point of my argument: there is a difference between doing this voluntarily and under compulsion. It is a distinction which may not be too clear to the Opposition, but it is certainly a distinction of which I can assure her that people who run small businesses are only too well aware.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-06_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The Minister has drawn a distinction which indeed marks a division between us. We do not believe that the right of a disabled person to employment should depend on whether the employer voluntarily wishes to conform to the Bill. That is the question. We do not believe that the decision by an employer to conform to the Bill should be a voluntary activity. The Minister has made my point.
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para3"></a>We believe that firms should be required to conform to the law. We have sought to argue that the cost is modest. We want government to be especially helpful to small companies as well as large. We may address that point in subsequent amendments. We therefore believe that the advice and support services which government seek to provide for small companies will be extremely important.
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para4"></a>At the end of the day there remains the question which the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, asked. Given that small companies will not be asked to employ anyone with a disability where the disability is relevant to the work and hinders the job to be done&#151;in other words, the disability is irrelevant to the work; the point was again raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton of Dalzell&#151;and given that no company is asked to make such adaptions as would impose unreasonable costs on that company, for the life of me I still do not see why we should exclude small firms at the cost of disabled people's rights. However, it may surprise the Minister that I would prefer to come back to this at Report stage. With the leave of the Committee, I wish to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 5, line 23, leave out ("may") and insert ("shall").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-06_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 53 and at the same time speak to my other amendments, Amendments Nos. 54 and 56. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, will use this group of amendments to put the question which he was unable to ask a moment ago.
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para7"></a>The purpose of the group of amendments is to reduce the size of firm exempted from the employment provisions of the Bill from 20 employees to 10 after five years, to five people after 10 years and to remove the exemption completely after 15 years.
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para8"></a>One in six workers is employed in small businesses. The figure is far higher in rural areas; it would be far higher in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, for example, 84 per cent. of firms have fewer than 10 employees, so it is probable that 90 per cent. employ fewer than 20 people. That would mean that only 10 per cent. of the firms in Northern Ireland would be subject to the legislation. It is not really on only to legislate for 10 per cent. of people doing basically the same thing and who are involved in business.
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para9"></a>Exemption is not offered to employers employing fewer than 20 employees under the sex and racial discrimination laws. Small businesses are the fastest growing sector of the economy. Clause 7, as it stands, would leave small businesses legally able to discriminate against people with disabilities. Clause 6 requires an employer,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to take such steps as it is reasonable, in all the circumstances of the case, for him to have to take".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para10"></a>Regulations under the clause will enable a limit to be put on the costs that an employer could be expected to meet. Obviously, a small employer would not be expected to have the same financial resources as a larger employer. But where it is reasonable for small employers to make accommodations they should be required to do so.
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para11"></a>Most disabled people only require minor adjustments to the working environment. I suggest also that it would be reasonable to look at the turnover of the firm in question because some firms obviously run on a small margin and other firms make vast profits.

<a name="50615-06_para12"></a>During the Second Reading debate in the other place, the Minister for Disabled People, Mr. Hague, agreed that in the United States reasonable accommodation costs nothing in 43 per cent. of cases,

<P>

<a name="50615-06_para13"></a>The Government's compliance cost assessment of the Bill, as we heard, is suggested as being &#163;200 which would be a reasonable average of what an employer might be expected to have to pay to accommodate a disabled employee.
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para14"></a>In the other place in the debate on the exemption of small firms, Mr. Hague also said that it,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reflects the Government's recognition that it may be more difficult and burdensome for smaller firms to get to grips with the new right".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para15"></a>He told the all-party disablement group that small firms do not have the specialist personnel functions. If the Government's main objection is that small firms do not have the resources in terms of personnel, including information, knowledge and expertise, then why could they not follow the CBI's advice and give more support to small firms together with the phasing in of compliance requirements for smaller businesses, as has happened in the United States of America? The CBI argues against the inevitable arbitrariness of the cut-offs and exclusions.
<P>

<a name="50615-06_para16"></a>In his response to the Second Reading debate in this House at col. 887 of Hansard for 22nd May, my noble friend Lord Mackay said that the CBI represents few, if any, employers with fewer than 20 employees. He went on to say that he thought that it would be difficult to find many, if any, of those in its membership. It is my understanding that over 50 per cent. of the businesses that the CBI represents, including those through trade associations and employer organisations, are small businesses with fewer than 20 people. He said that 60 per cent. of firms employing fewer than 10 people had disabled employees. That point has already been made today. He said that the Government welcomed that fact and that the Bill would not prevent them continuing to do that. I quite agree. The codes of practice would encourage them to do so. Surely, the fact that so many small employers employ disabled people shows that if employers have the right attitude, then employing disabled people is not a problem for small firms. I beg to move.

<A NAME="50615-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I am happy to support the amendment clearly moved by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. Many of the arguments which will be used when we reach the amendment to be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwin, on Clause 34 have already been rehearsed by the noble Lords, Lord Campbell of Croy and Lord Ashley of Stoke. However, I shall return to the quota system in due course when we reach that amendment.
<P>

<a name="50615-07_para0"></a>As to small firms, I have to say at the outset that I have known small businesses where the entire workforce&#151;one person&#151;was disabled. The Minister has stressed that many small employers are good when it comes to employing disabled people. But the Government seem to be speaking against many informed organisations, and many organisations are against them, when it comes to the <P>


<a name="column_1910"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1910</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>issue of the exclusion of small firms, including many business and employer organisations which might have been thought likely to favour exemption for employers from the new obligations.
<P>

<a name="50615-07_para1"></a>I felt some sympathy for the Minister in this House and for his ministerial colleague in another place in trying to defend the exclusion of firms with fewer than 20 employees. I also in my time have had to try to sound convincing on a public stage with a lousy script, but at least I had the advantage of being able to mask that awkwardness by some theatrical business which might not be wholly acceptable in the Palace of Westminster.
<P>

<a name="50615-07_para2"></a>Once again, the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, is being helpful to the Government by taking up their willingness to move forward on a phased timetable and offering them a generously phased timetable for doing so. That phased approach would allow experience of the Bill's provisions to be gained with larger employers. As smaller employers came in, they and their employees would benefit from that experience. However, the test of reasonableness will still relate to the specific circumstances. I see no realistic possibility that what has been required of a very large employer will subsequently be required of a very small employer. Our law and our lawyers are very firm on not following irrelevant precedents.
<P>

<a name="50615-07_para3"></a>Given that there are many areas where small employers are the norm and given also that small employers are being created by the break-up&#151;this point is very important at the moment&#151;of larger employees and that many small employers are already abiding by rules from which the Government propose they should be exempted, together with the protection of the "reasonableness" criterion, I support this amendment as one that achieves fairness and logic by generous stages.

<A NAME="50615-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   The debate has seemed to revolve around the same idea; namely, why should a small employer be treated differently to a slightly larger employer, and where is the arbitrary line to be drawn? I do not like the clause at all, but these amendments have one thing going for them. They draw down that arbitrary line which we know will act as a staging post to help people to adapt their working practices to new legislation. Thus, the amendments proposed are within the context of the Bill; indeed, they fall within the logic of the Government and suggest measures which should probably have been in the Bill in the first place. Indeed, we are about to debate a government amendment which proposes a review.
<P>

<a name="50615-07_para4"></a>We can review things until we are blue in the face. If we do not have the will to change them and we do not accept the terms of logic of any review when it tells us something, things will not be changed. I know that I am jumping slightly ahead of this amendment but all the amendments are related. Unless we accept the fact that we do not want this type of discrimination, an arbitrary line drawn for whatever reason should be removed whenever possible. We have the safety net of reasonableness placed in the Bill. Given that "reasonableness" is not defined, I suggest that the Government will save themselves a lot of time and effort by coming up with a good definition. If <P>

<A NAME="50615-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   Those who support this amendment, and who supported the previous one, argue that the costs of compliance will be small. An average figure of &#163;200 was mentioned several times. I suspect that capital expenditure is in the forefront of their minds, and that may well on average be as small as &#163;200. It is a one-off, and can be written off over several years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-07_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Perhaps I can help the noble Lord. The figure of &#163;200 comes from the Government's own cost compliance statement of the average cost for a firm to accommodate itself to the provisions of this Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I entirely understand that. I was not disagreeing with the figure &#163;200 at all. However, I believe that the noble Baroness has totally overlooked the question of current expenditure. Under subsection (3) of Clause 6 any employer obliged to incur expenditure under paragraphs (f), (g), (k) and (l) in combination could well find himself not &#163;200, as a one-off, out of pocket, but thousands of pounds out of pocket&#151;over a thousand pounds at any rate&#151;year after year after year after year. For a firm employing 100 people with, let us say, two disabled employees, such costs could perhaps be absorbed. But for a firm with six employees one of whom is disabled, it could make all the difference between profit and loss, between survival and bankruptcy.
<P>

<a name="50615-07_para5"></a>The argument against what I have said lies in the idea of reasonableness. But the term "reasonableness" is entirely subjective: I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, brought that point out. We have no precise definition of what is reasonable. I suspect that its interpretation will depend to some extent on the whims of the Secretary of State of the day. We are in Henry VIII clause territory, so disliked by my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale and the noble Earl, Lord Russell. Until we get a much firmer test of what is reasonable and what is not, I think&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-07_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but surely "reasonable" is a term used again and again at law. It is a matter that the tribunals then decide. Is that not what it is all about?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   It may be. The press have commented on this Bill, saying that it will provide an absolute bonanza for lawyers, and one can see why that assertion is made. In any case, I think that the Government are on the right lines and I certainly oppose these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I did not quite catch the paragraphs to which the noble Lord referred, but there are a number of stipulations under subsection (3) of Clause 6 that would render an employer eligible for the access to work scheme, and the grants will be on a continuing basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I accept that, but I believe it applies to capital rather than current expenditure. Am I not right?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   It applies to both.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-07_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   It seems to me that this whole matter is being completely misunderstood. What is reasonable for a firm with 20 employees may be unreasonable for a firm that has six. Therefore, the interpretation of "reasonableness" will be in the context of the size of the firm, the kind of work that it does, and the resources of that firm.
<P>

<a name="50615-07_para6"></a>The Minister argued against the last amendment, saying that it would place an unfair burden on small employers, not only in terms of cost but in terms of the burden of actually understanding the legislation and how it would apply. That argument seems to be completely removed by this particular amendment, which provides for a period of time during which the Act will operate enabling us to find out what is and is not reasonable.
<P>

<a name="50615-07_para7"></a>I know that many people hope that not many cases will be brought under this Act. I do not accept that the legislation will mean a lawyers' paradise, but some cases will be brought. Their purpose will be to give an interpretation of what is meant. Very early on we shall need an interpretation of "reasonableness". I was sorry that the Minister was not able to accept the last amendment; but I should have thought that this amendment would be very acceptable to him. Even if a small firm does not have personnel resources, the Act will have been operating and lots of guidance will become available over the course of five years, all of which will be of great assistance to small firms. I really do feel that this whole question of reasonableness is being drawn across the scene as a red herring.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-07_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   There is another point. We are all talking as though small firms are manned by people who are absolute dunderheads. A great many small firms now are doing high quality work and employ highly intelligent people. Quite a lot of them are just as capable of understanding what is in the legislation as people in very large firms. I do not know why we should assume that firms are manned by people who are all stupid just because they are small.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-07_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   One of the points that we need to recognise is that sometimes legislation has untoward effects. Sometimes the results of legislation are not those for which Parliament planned. I wonder whether we might be coming up against a similar problem in respect of this particular aspect of the Bill. So far as I am aware, there is no bar on a firm effectively subdividing itself so that each unit comprises fewer than 20 employees, each individual part of a company being effectively considered as an individual firm within the meaning of the Act and therefore not falling under the terms of the Act. That is my understanding of the way the legislation will work.
<P>

<a name="50615-07_para8"></a>On Tuesday the Minister said that the situation for a firm would effectively change if its size went down from 21 employees to 19 and that the legislative regime would be different. I am worried that, because of people's perception that complying with the Act will be onerous, they will seek to evade its requirements and in so doing hinder the operation of their companies by taking action they would not normally take; for example, by not employing an additional employee which would take the company over the 20 employee mark when it would be in the interests of the company to do so, or by engaging in <P>


<a name="column_1913"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1913</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what I might describe as artificial manipulation of the company such as subdividing it into units of less than 20 in order to evade their responsibilities under the Act.
<P>

<a name="50615-07_para9"></a>I hope that such things would not happen but we need to be aware that it is a risk. It might happen and it would be detrimental. The reason for such things happening would be the perception that the provisions of the legislation are onerous on business. We need to project the fact that the whole idea of this anti-discrimination legislation is not to put a burden on anybody but to liberate people.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Much of this territory was debated on the last amendment. I suspect that we shall debate it twice more today. As the Committee knows, the Bill clearly states that the "20" threshold can be decreased by order. It cannot in fact be increased, which is in line with an amendment that was agreed in the other place. That enables the Government to ensure that changes could be made over time, taking into account the experience gained, as I mentioned, in operating the new right and other relevant circumstances, such as the economic conditions at the time. Indeed, the next amendment, which is in my name, will impose on the Government the obligation to look at this issue in four or five years' time and, one way or another, come before the Chamber with a view.
<P>

<a name="50615-08_para0"></a>My noble friend Lord Swinfen with his two amendments seeks to commit the Government and future administrations to making specific changes according to a fixed timetable irrespective of the circumstances of the time. I believe that such an approach would be highly unusual in employment legislation. I must say that I have heard no more convincing argument for going down that road than I heard in the last debate for going down the road of only allowing this clause to operate for just a few months, although I accept that the initial view was that it would perhaps last for a year. Indeed, that is a decision we shall come to shortly if the noble Lord, Lord Addington, opposes the Motion that the clause shall stand part of the Bill. The noble Lord indicated that he does not want any protection at all for small employers from this day onwards or from the day of enactment of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50615-08_para1"></a>I suppose that neither my noble friend Lord Swinfen nor the Committee will be surprised to hear that I do not agree with this amendment either. I believe that the position that we have taken is a balanced position, taking into account the considerable number of employees who will be covered by the Act. Let me repeat that. Sometimes, I feel that people come to the statistics of this matter from an entirely wrong direction. It is not a case of how many firms are covered; it is a case of how many people are covered. Eighty per cent. of employees will be covered by the Act.
<P>

<a name="50615-08_para2"></a>My noble friend mentioned Northern Ireland and rural areas. If he checks, I think he will find that there are a considerable number of large firms which operate in rural areas. For example, the local authority is usually a fairly large employer in a rural area, as it is elsewhere. Other examples might be British Telecom, British Gas (in an area where there is gas) or an electricity company. Let me say to the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, that his machiavellian fears are totally unfounded. One would <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>have to split a company entirely, completely and absolutely, so that it had under 20 people before one would be able to get away with not observing the provisions of the Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   On that point, what is the position with company groups, where there are a number of small companies which are ostensibly owned by a group but which are in fact operating together?
<P>

<a name="50615-08_time0"></a><H5>4.45 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I thought that that was the answer that I gave. A conglomerate or a mini-conglomerate, however one likes to describe it, is considered as one company. I do not think that one can break up one's company into self-contained operating units. One would have to go to the extent of creating absolutely separate and unrelated companies before one would get out of obeying the terms of the Bill. I shall study what my noble friend said to see whether I have fully answered his question. But I thought that I had answered his question quite clearly. I am satisfied that there is no way out of this, apart from going to very considerable expense.
<P>

<a name="50615-08_para3"></a>If we look at this matter in terms of cost or of administrative imposition on the individual running the business&#151;the ground which I believe is more important&#151;on either of those grounds, I doubt whether going to the bother of splitting the company, with all the trouble and hassle, as well as legal fees (dare I say it?) involved, would be a very sensible action. I do not feel that the end result of evading this legislation would in any way be worth going down that particular road.
<P>

<a name="50615-08_para4"></a>Interestingly enough, the first downward step that my noble friend wants is to 15 employees. While the total number of firms covered by this part of the Bill would increase by over 50 per cent., that step would bring in a lot of small firms with many people running their own business working very many hours. My slight difficulty here is that I have a very close friend who runs a very small business. I can imagine his reaction, when I go back at the weekend and say, "By the way, we have just put some more burdens on you and more legislation that you have to obey." I should get a flea in my ear very quickly indeed. It would not be the cost, as I tried to explain in the previous amendment, though that has an important part to play. It is the fact that there is another piece of legislation to be understood and, more than that, to be borne in mind every time one needs to take on somebody or somebody leaves and he has to be replaced and one realises the parameters within which one would then have to operate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   If the noble Lord's friend were employing 21 people, how would he explain it to him?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I suspect that if my friend's company were to go up in numbers towards that figure, then he would be beginning to be free of the other things he has to do; namely, to work alongside his employees and all that part and parcel of his small business. He would probably concentrate more on the management of the business of which that is a part.
<P>

<a name="50615-08_para5"></a>We could have a little argument about whether the number was 21, 20 or 19. If you are agreeing to draw a line&#151;I suspect that many Members of the Committee <P>


<a name="column_1915"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1915</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who oppose me at this moment do not want any line drawn but want any firm, regardless of size, to be caught immediately by this legislation&#151;it seems to me that 20 is a reasonable number.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. Perhaps I may ask him one question. Is not the basis of all this an unfortunate idea that people with disabilities who are being employed (or are to be employed) are, frankly, not capable of carrying out the work for which they are employed with 100 per cent. efficiency? That seems to me to lie behind this discrimination. If a person is worthy of his crust, whether disabled or able bodied, he will not be any revenue cost to the company once suitable machinery has been put into place. We hope that access to work machinery and finance will be available. I am a little worried that we are implying that disabled people will, frankly, make inefficient employees.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   That is not what I am saying. Clearly I am not making myself understood, if that is the implication. I am talking about the burden of obeying the legislation, understanding it, dealing with it and keeping it in mind, especially as it involves this test of reasonableness in what one might do. That is the burden I am discussing, not the point being made by the noble Lord, Lord Rix.
<P>

<a name="50615-08_para6"></a>The figures I mentioned earlier in relation to the number of people already employed in small firms shows clearly that the problem posed by the noble Lord does not exist for most small firms. I would not say that there are not a few small firms who would take the view that the noble Lord takes, but that is not my view. I am trying to deal with two burdens: the cost burden, which is of lesser importance, and also the burden of administering the Act, understanding it and keeping it in mind on the few occasions when one employs people.
<P>

<a name="50615-08_para7"></a>Unlike a large company where a personnel department probably spends quite a lot of time interviewing and employing people, a small firm with under 20 employees probably does not do that very often. It may have a stable workforce and it may be quite infrequent that it will need to go round the course of taking on a new employee. That adds to its problems. Here we have a little piece of legislation which will not be with the company on a day-to-day basis, perhaps not even on a month-to-month basis. It may have to bring the provisions to the forefront of its mind quite infrequently.
<P>

<a name="50615-08_para8"></a>A little has been said regarding the CBI. It seems to be suggested that it represents small companies. I believe&#151;dare I say?&#151;that a little bit of sleight of hand is being practised in saying that. I believe 50 per cent. was the figure given of small businesses belonging to the CBI. That is the way the figure was quoted to me. But that arithmetic is arrived at by counting those small businesses that are members of trade associations and in turn those trade associations are members of the CBI&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   We are trying to stop the Minister from falling even further into error and are trying to be helpful. The same point was made on the previous debate when we on this side of the Chamber used the same figures in relation to the CBI. The Minister sought to answer the point then. Therefore, not only did he mishear his noble friend, but he forgot what he said the first time round.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I remember what I said and I believe I understood what I said. I mentioned the fact that the Federation of Small Businesses supports the exclusion of small firms. I felt that that was slightly better ground on which to stand than praying in aid the CBI which, as we have all agreed, does not incorporate all that many individual small member firms. As my noble friend rightly pointed out&#151;I concur with him&#151;most of the small firms counted in the 50 per cent., which is claimed by the lobby in relation to the CBI, are only indirect members of the CBI through trade associations. As long as we are all clear on that, perhaps I can carry on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   I am afraid the Minister seems to be having a bad time. However, I am amazed that he makes such a meal of the fact that the Bill will be difficult to understand. The Bill says that in taking on a new employee one must not discriminate because that person is disabled. I would lay a wager that the small employer who the Minister sees at the weekend&#151;and whom he is afraid to meet this coming weekend&#151;could have the Bill explained to him in 10 minutes flat. He would not have the slightest difficulty in understanding what he must do. Where is the difficulty? I agree that some legislation drives all employers, small and large, absolutely dotty, but this is straightforward. What is the difficulty?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   The difficulty is twofold. It is not as easy as the noble Baroness makes out. There is the qualification that the employer must not discriminate. However, there is also the fine tuning that he can discriminate if employing a person would mean adjustments to his firm that were not reasonable in their cost. Therefore, other aspects are involved bar the simple statement that he must not discriminate against disabled people. I hope everybody will think about that; it is the qualification that adds to the complication.
<P>

<a name="50615-09_para0"></a>While I may explain the Bill to my friend this weekend, it may be some months before he is interviewing and employing or replacing an employee. That must be borne in mind. In any case, it is our view and that of the <P>


<a name="column_1917"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1917</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Federation of Small Businesses, that this is a reasonable line to draw. In a few minutes I shall explain how we will be prepared to review it in four years and then come back to the House in five years' time. At that stage, if it is the view of your Lordships and the Government, I have little doubt that under the powers in this clause we shall be able to reduce to whatever figure it is decided is reasonable. For the moment, we would like to keep it where it is.
<P>

<a name="50615-09_para1"></a>I said to my noble friend that I should like to check the question he asked in regard to a company breaking itself up or being part of a group. I answered him but indicated that I would write to him if I was wrong. I can do better than that. I can say that I probably got that wrong. Each individual company within a group is a separate employer. My point is that it would not be sensible for a company to split itself up into groups just to get away from having to apply this Bill. Therefore, that is not a realistic scenario to contemplate.
<P>

<a name="50615-09_para2"></a>To return to the legislation in front of us, I have said on a number of occasions&#151;I appreciate that there is a difference of opinion on this&#151;that the smaller the firm, undoubtedly the more difficult and costly it is for the individual who runs that firm to, not just take on board this piece of legislation, but also take on board all the pieces of legislation, some of which the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, described as being "dotty". I believe, therefore, that she is slightly on my side in relation to the generality of this issue.
<P>

<a name="50615-09_para3"></a>We must take account of the need to keep down the burden on small businesses. That is a burden not just of cost, but of administration and the knowledge of legislation and so forth. Of course, as the small business grows&#151;as we hope it will do&#151;and grows sufficiently, it will fall to be considered within the terms of the Bill. For all those reasons, which are similar to the ones on the previous amendment, I cannot accept my noble friend's amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   I did not interrupt my noble friend because he was coping manfully with many other interruptions. But I should like to ask him&#151;he need not reply now because there will be more debates on this clause&#151;whether his department is watching what is happening in the United States.
<P>

<a name="50615-09_para4"></a>None of us wants to impose burdens on small firms. I am sure we all agree with what my noble friend said. But the Americans With Disabilities Act, known as ADA, requires a reduction of the equivalent figure for small firms. That is graduated over a number of years and the first graduation is just taking place or has just taken place. It would be interesting to know whether the British Government are watching what is happening in the United States in this field and whether the small firms there, who again are described as firms which employ a certain number or less of employees, are going through difficulties in the reduction which must take place under that legislation every few years, as is suggested in the amendment. Though I accept all the problems indicated by my noble friend that may arise for small businesses, it would be interesting to compare notes with similar legislation which is ahead of us on this.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am happy to answer my noble friend. The Department of Employment does indeed look carefully at the United States' experience. It is from that experience that we have drawn the average cost figure of &#163;200. I believe I am right in saying that the United States started off with 25 and has now dropped the number to 15. Therefore, while the US approach may be slightly different, it appreciated the need to have a line below which a small firm did not come within the compass of the Act. The United States agrees with us in that regard, although it has done it in a slightly different way and is now down at 15. I am starting at 20. I am suggesting that if in five years' time, after review, the government of the day and both Houses think it is reasonable to go down to 15, that is the right time to do it. But I think that we should start with the line being drawn at 20.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-09_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   Perhaps I may ask for some clarification on what might happen once the Bill becomes an Act. Would it be possible for a firm employing fewer than 20 people to have an advertisement for recruits effectively saying that only able-bodied people should apply? Furthermore, would it be possible for a firm employing fewer than 20 people to advertise itself as employing only able-bodied people? What would be the implications and the effect of such an advertisement appearing in newspapers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-09_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   With regard to the question of my noble friend Lord Campbell about the American Act, the Act did allow for a reduction from 25 to 15 after two years, but, interestingly enough, it has no provision for going any further down than 15; whereas if future governments want to reduce the figure they can use the provisions of this Act. I am advised that the answer to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, is that a firm could do what he suggests.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-09_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   Just to back up my earlier statement that it might imply that disabled people were not particularly cost-effective or efficient, perhaps I may read briefly from the parliamentary brief given by the CBI. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"While all firms want their competitiveness safeguarded, few would wish to be seen to occupy a sector where discrimination is tolerated and where individual, talented disabled people might be deterred from employment".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-09_para5"></a>It seems that the CBI has the same idea that disabled people might well consider themselves not up to the job if this clause goes through in its present form.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-09_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   We have had quite a useful debate on this subject and I thank all those who have taken part. In his first intervention the noble Lord, Lord Rix, quite rightly said that I was trying to be of assistance to the Government. If my noble friend has the foresight to accept this group of three amendments he will not need to move his amendment; nor will he have all the hard work of consideration after four years, and presumably from time to time after that; quite apart from the cost to the taxpayer and everything else. The amendments would help over a number of years to produce a level playing field throughout the world of work.

<a name="50615-09_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monson, was worried about the current cost of employing a disabled person. In my view, that would have to be taken into consideration when the question of reasonableness was being considered: and what was reasonable for one small firm with a very large turnover and large profits might not be reasonable for a firm employing the same number of people with only a very low turnover and marginal profits. That was also brought out by the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, who pointed out that reasonableness would vary from case to case.

<a name="50615-09_para7"></a>An interesting intervention from the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, brought out the fact that each firm in a group was a separate employer. That means not that a firm would split itself up&#151;that would be totally impractical, as the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, suggested&#151;but that a firm wishing to expand would, under certain circumstances, set up separate firms under one group as separate employers. What would be the position during recession of a firm dropping below the 20 mark and then a few years later, or a few months later, going back over that figure?
<P>

<a name="50615-09_para8"></a>The Minister said that something would have to be borne in mind and&#151;I think I have got him right&#151;that it would be a difficult position. But that is in a totally different context from the present position of all employers in regard to the requirements of a fire officer. A new fire officer in an area may have different fads, but his instructions must be followed, whether one likes it or not, sometimes at costs considerably higher than the figures that have been mentioned in this short debate.
<P>

<a name="50615-09_para9"></a>I should like to reflect on what has been said, perhaps discuss the matter with my noble friend between the end of the Committee stage and Report, and possibly come back to the matter at Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
("(3) In this section&#151;
<br>
"anniversary" means the anniversary of the coming into force of this section; and

"review" means a review of the effect of this section.

(4) Where, before the fourth anniversary, the Secretary of State proposes to make an order under subsection (2), he shall, before doing so, conduct a review.

(6) Any review shall be completed within nine months.
<br>
(7) In conducting any review, the Secretary of State shall consult&#151;

(a) such organisations representing the interests of employers as he considers appropriate; and
<br>
(b) such organisations representing the interests of disabled persons in employment or seeking employment as he considers appropriate.

<br>
(a) summarising the results of the review; and

(b) giving the reasons for his decision.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-10_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: After an hour or so on the previous amendment we may well be able to find ourselves in agreement about this amendment. We have listened carefully to the arguments&#151;we have heard them again this afternoon&#151;calling for changes in this clause. I have this afternoon, as my colleagues did in another place, rebutted many of the suggested amendments but I hope that we have not been totally inflexible. Indeed, Clause 7 was amended in another place and that amendment removed the power to raise the threshold from the exemption above 20. In reaching that decision we recognised it was very unlikely that there would ever be a need to raise the threshold above the initial starting number.
<P>

<a name="50615-10_para1"></a>My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment, when announcing the change, gave an undertaking to bring forward a further amendment. That amendment, which is before your Lordships today as government Amendment No. 55, would require the Secretary of State to review the operation of the clause within five years of it coming into force and give Parliament the opportunity to debate the issue. We will be considering what research may be necessary for that review.
<P>

<a name="50615-10_para2"></a>Perhaps I may say to my noble friend Lord Swinfen, who seemed to wish to relieve me of some work in five years' time, that I would be more than happy to come to the Dispatch Box in five years' time and propose whatever changes are to be made in the Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   How can the noble Lord be so confident that he will be there in five years' time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My noble friend was clearly confident. I was just thanking him for his confidence. I am sure that the whole House, or at least half the House, will join me in hoping that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, will be speaking from the same Dispatch Box as he is today.
<P>

<a name="50615-10_para3"></a>I have made all my points about why we do not think that we should move now from 20. But I understand the arguments. What the amendment does is to ensure that enshrined in legislation there will be an obligation on the Government, four years from the anniversary of the Bill coming into force, to set up a review and, at the five-year point, to come to Parliament one way or another. I am quite sure, having listened to noble Lords who would certainly like me to go a great deal further than this, that the Committee will welcome this small step. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   In his last sentence the Minister anticipated with wonderful accuracy the position of the Opposition on this. Given the amendments that have so far been moved, we indeed wish that the Minister had gone further, but that takes nothing away from the fact <P>


<a name="column_1921"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1921</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that we welcome this amendment. We are grateful that the Minister in another place felt able to listen to the voices and representations that had been put to him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   The Minister began introducing the amendment by saying that he hoped that all Members of the Committee would agree with it. I find myself 99 per cent. in agreement with it, but I have one small quibble. Subsection (7) provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State shall consult&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) such organisations representing the interests of employers as he considers appropriate".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-10_para4"></a>I wonder why that is not further circumscribed by the insertion of the word "small" before the word "employers". As the Minister pointed out when speaking to a previous amendment, the membership of the CBI, and the interests of that membership, are not the same and do not always coincide with the membership of and the interests of the membership of the Federation of Small Businesses or the Institute of Directors. It seems appropriate that the Secretary of State should specifically consult organisations representing the interests of small employers&#151;that is, those employing fewer than 20 people&#151;rather than employers in general.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Monson, knows that a number of very large industries in the CBI are fed by very much smaller firms and would want to be happy that those smaller firms are operating efficiently and looking after disabled people properly. Having said that, I very much welcome the amendment although, in my view, my amendment would have been better&#151;but perhaps I am just being my normal big-headed self.
<P>

<a name="50615-10_para5"></a>Nevertheless, I am delighted that the amendment sets the Secretary of State a time limit within which the review must be completed. We so often see Bills provide for reviews to take place but without specifying a time limit, which means that the review drags on and on. I very much welcome that provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I have just one question. If at the end of that period of time the Secretary of State (after his due consultation with both small and large firms, disability organisations and disabled people themselves) decides totally to do away with the embargo of 15, 12 or whatever in relation to small firms, could he so do?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am not entirely sure. I would need time to read both the clause and the amendment. I am advised that the answer is "no", but I shall check and may be able to return to this point later.
<P>

<a name="50615-10_para6"></a>Perhaps I may advise the noble Lord, Lord Monson, that, by and large, we shall be talking to small employers. However, we shall also want to talk to those employers who are implementing the legislation because I imagine that decisions will have to be taken with a view to how the legislation is working and what difficulties have been encountered. We shall do that, as well as taking the views of small employers into account. As I said, I shall check the answer I gave to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, when I have had the opportunity to read both the amendment and the <P>


<a name="column_1922"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1922</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>original provisions. I am not sure whether I am all that good at reading on my feet, but I think that I have succeeded.
<P>

<a name="50615-10_para7"></a>Looking into the future, the legislation provides that the Secretary of State may make orders, but may only go as far as a reduction to firms with fewer than two employees. Perhaps I may describe that as the "irreducible minimum".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   Under Clause 7(2), the Secretary of State may substitute "a different number". Could he substitute zero?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I think that the problem&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   On the same subject, I do not understand why the figure "two" has been suggested. I should have thought that it should be "one"&#151;with one person employing one other, or employing himself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My noble friend has got in ahead of me. The "two" includes the employer. My noble friend correctly points out that if it were reduced to one&#151;namely, the employer&#151;there would no longer be an employee to come within the scope of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that answer and for busking till ready. Perhaps I may make the position absolutely clear from my point of view. If by experience, by lobbying, consultations, and all the other things that will take place over the next five years from the date of the enactment of the Bill, this whole provision in relation to employers with fewer than 20 employees could disappear from the Act, that offers us definite hope for the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-10_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   That is exactly what my amendment would allow. I am delighted to give the noble Lord that hope.

("( ) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to have regard to the needs of employers who have fewer than 20 employees and to make such financial provision by way of grants or loans as he deems appropriate to enable them to meet the obligations to disabled persons which they would have but for the exemption contained in this section.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-11_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: I tabled this amendment as a peg, coat-hanger or basis upon which to ask the Minister to place on the record, if he would be so kind, exactly what encouragement, arrangements and financial assistance he will give to small firms with fewer than 20 employees to bring them voluntarily within the law if the Bill is not amended in its passage through your Lordships' House. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The amendment gives rise to an interesting situation because some types of business&#151;I shall mention one in a moment&#151;would find it exceedingly difficult to employ a disabled person in any <P>


<a name="column_1923"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1923</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>capacity. I refer, for example, to the business of operating taxis. It would be very difficult if a number of disabled people applied for employment in a taxi business. Such a business comprises mainly drivers, with a mechanic or two, and it would be difficult for such a business to employ any disabled person. Therefore, it is right that the noble Baroness should have tabled an amendment stating that the Secretary of State is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to have regard to the needs of employers who have fewer than 20 employees".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para1"></a>I am glad that she has given me the opportunity to cite an example of where such a special case should be considered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   In the special case mentioned by my noble friend, it would be reasonable not to employ a disabled person.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I thank both my noble friends for their valid comments&#151;one in asking and the other in answering. However, as the noble Baroness used the process of moving the amendment simply to ask me a question&#151;I take it, therefore, that the amendment is about to be withdrawn&#151;perhaps I may concentrate on trying to help the noble Baroness on what we intend to do to try to encourage small firms&#151;although outside the ambit of this legislation&#151;to try to behave as we all want them to behave.
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para2"></a>I said earlier that my honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State for Employment made our position very clear in the other place. Of course, we want small firms to continue their good record of employing disabled people. We certainly do not want them to discriminate. We shall encourage them to follow a code of practice that we shall be drawing up. In drawing up that code of practice, which, as long as the Bill escapes unharmed from your Lordships' House in this regard, will apply legally only to firms with more than 20 employees, we shall think about and consult not only with such firms or their representative organisations, but also with firms of fewer than 20 employees and their representative organisations. That will mean that the new code of practice will apply not only to firms with more than 20 employees, to which the Act will apply, but that it will be equally applicable as a code of good practice to firms with fewer than 20 employees. I hope that that answer is helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That takes us part of the way. Perhaps the Minister could write to me because I should like to know what eligibility small firms will have for any grants or assistance that will be available, as of right, to firms with more than 20 employees. In other words, on the assumption, which I hope is false, that the figure of 20 remains in place when the Bill has passed through your Lordships' House, all of us will have a commitment to bring voluntarily within the framework of the law as many smaller companies with fewer than 20 employees as possible.
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para3"></a>The only way we might be able to do that is with a carrot, because there will be no stick. I was trying to discover from the Minister what would be the range of carrots to encourage small companies to come within the framework of the Bill. The Minister gave us an answer about codes of guidance and the like. Perhaps he will <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>write to me about the financial resources available to small firms so that we can see how they may be brought into the Act. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para5"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 7, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   I wish to oppose the Motion that Clause 7 stand part of the Bill on the simple ground that I have heard a great deal of talk about how important it is for small employers. We have heard a great deal about the concept of reasonableness. If making reasonable provision and not discriminating against anyone is the concept behind the Bill, surely it should apply to all employers. We have also heard that the concept of reasonableness will not apply as an absolute standard. It is something which applies to individual firms and cases. If that is a valid concept, surely it makes irrelevant the clause under which firms with fewer than a certain number of employees are exempt. If the Government's thinking is correct, the clause is not needed. On those grounds, I oppose the Motion that the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   I wish to make two comments and ask the Minister two questions. First, I am sorry to see the Minister clashing with his right honourable friend the Prime Minister, because the Prime Minister has assured us that small firms are at the heart of Britain's economic recovery. He says what wonderful people they are. They are enterprising and leading Britain out of economic despond. But the Minister implies that they are rather dim-witted people who cannot understand the problems involved in taking on one or two disabled workers. So firms with fewer than 20 workers are incompetent. They are helping Britain's recovery, but they are too dim to understand the problems caused by taking on one or two disabled workers. Can the Minister justify that objection and that reason for excluding from the Bill firms with fewer than 20 workers?
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para6"></a>Secondly, several people have mentioned the question of reasonableness being difficult. I see no problem. Many distinguished lawyers have been present and they know that the concept of reasonableness is something with which the courts have no problem. If it will cause such enormous problems, then those Conservative Back-Benchers who are complaining should ask the Government not to bring in the concept of reasonableness. I see no difficulty with it, but if they do they should talk to their Minister.
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para7"></a>I wish to ask the Minister two simple questions. I am concerned that he is evading my questions. I do not know whether it is because he does not hear me, in which case perhaps I should speak louder, or because he is the skilled politician that we all think he is and is learning to prevaricate and to answer just those questions he prefers to answer.
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para8"></a>My first question is partly a general question. I am not sure whether the Minister said that small firms cannot discriminate against disabled people. If he did say that, he is wrong, because clearly they can discriminate. Does he agree that if he did not say it, and if small firms can legally discriminate against disabled people, then that is unjustifiable and morally wrong?
<P>


<a name="column_1925"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1925</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para9"></a>Secondly, the Bill says that no unreasonable burdens should be imposed upon employers. It says in fact that the burden should be reasonable. Will the Minister tell us whether it will be legal or illegal to impose unreasonable burdens on firms when the Bill is enacted?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Addington, in opposing the Motion that Clause 7 stand part of the Bill. Although we must be careful of anecdotes, perhaps I may declare an interest. I am a director of a company with seven employees, of whom three are full-time and four are part-time. Of the seven, four are disabled. Our experience is interesting. With the small office that we occupy, the cost to us has been comparatively small. We have installed some moveable wooden ramps and moved the position of the electric light points so that those who use wheelchairs can reach them.
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para10"></a>For the landlord it is different. It is a building with 100 to 150 people going through it. The landlord has had to put in a ramp to ensure that our employees can gain proper access. He welcomed that, because he said he should have done it before, and he has received a grant for doing it. That is one example.
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para11"></a>Perhaps I may give a second one. It is one that I gave on Second Reading. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, mentioned his experience in America. A number of the states&#151;it is not federal law&#151;have had laws for a long time with low limits on the number of employees caught by the disability legislation. I said on Second Reading that in California it is six and in New York four. I asked the Minister to comment on that. His reply was 100 per cent. accurate. He said that we were not America. I did not think that the reply added greatly to the stock of human knowledge.
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para12"></a>Another interesting point is that, so long as it is not unreasonable, there is in the Bill no exclusion of small providers of goods and services, only small employers. Small providers of whatever size have to meet the Bill's requirements. The point about unreasonable costs was dealt with extremely ably by my noble friend Lady Hollis.
<P>

<a name="50615-11_para13"></a>I conclude by saying that if we think it through, the Government are producing a curious argument. They are saying that discrimination is unlawful, except in small firms. According to the Government's thinking, anti-discrimination cannot be an absolute value; it can only be of relative value, because the Government are making it relative to the size of firm. It seems that to the Government costs and inconvenience are more important than the absolute value of anti-discrimination, something in which all of us on this side of the Committee believe. I am pleased to support the noble Lord, Lord Addington. If he decides to divide the Committee, we shall be with him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Carter, mentioned small providers. A restaurant of course is a small provider. Under the terms of the Bill, it will have to make access provisions for its clients but not for any disabled member of staff. That is daft. The Bill would be greatly improved if it did not include this clause.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   I made it clear that I hope in due course that small firms will be included, but I do not believe that it would be a good thing at this stage of the Bill to take out the whole clause. So I shall be supporting the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   By this time we are all well aware of what the clause does. It was amended in the other place to ensure that the size of firms which are exempt can be changed, and can only be changed downwards. It was decided that we should start at 20. In answer to my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy, I have already pointed to the American experience. They started at 25. There was a power to lower the figure. They lowered it to 15, and that is where, so far as concerns primary legislation across the United States, it must stay.
<P>

<a name="50615-12_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, reminded me of my answer to him, that this is not the United States. I thought that that was a sensible parliamentary reply: it was absolutely true, and added nothing to the information we all had available.
<P>

<a name="50615-12_para1"></a>Of course we look at the experience in other countries, including the United States, but we ought not necessarily to follow them in a slavish manner. I have set out in detail the proper place to start with the boundary, of which the noble Lord, Lord Addington, does not approve. He would say that a firm with only one employee should immediately be covered by the Bill. I am afraid that I cannot agree with him and he will not be surprised to hear that. I have introduced, and the Committee has agreed, the commitment to enact a requirement to review the operation of the clause within five years. That will give us sufficient time to see how the Bill works in firms with 20 or more employees and to take the view of firms with fewer than 20 employees. At the end of the five-year period we shall be able to see where we should go.
<P>

<a name="50615-12_para2"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, that I shall not become irritated by his suggestion because that would not help either of us. I thought that he made a nice debating point by implying that I assumed dim-witted people run small companies. Not at all. I suppose that one can say that they are a cross-section of your Lordships' House&#151;and the Committee can come to its own conclusions on that.
<P>

<a name="50615-12_para3"></a>I was making the point that even the cleverest has a great deal to do in running a firm in which usually they take virtually all the management responsibilities and probably take part in some of the work that is undertaken. They are probably involved in finding the contracts, selling the products, chasing up the unpaid bills, watching the books and so forth. I am talking about adding to that burden.
<P>

<a name="50615-12_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, asked a question which I thought was a tinge like asking me whether I had stopped beating my wife. He asked whether small firms can discriminate. I would rather put it this way: of course, they will not fall within the scope of the Bill but, as I and others have pointed out, many of them employ disabled people. As I said to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, we wish to encourage them not only to continue to do so but to increase the number of disabled people whom they employ.
<P>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1927</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-12_para5"></a>I turn now to the imposition of reasonable burdens, although I have forgotten the precise question. I tried to explain that I was not founding my argument so much on the cost, although cost would be a consideration. The &#163;200 is an average cost, which means that some could be above that. However, I accept that if the average cost is &#163;200, the majority will be less than that.
<P>

<a name="50615-12_para6"></a>My noble friend Lord Inglewood usually manages to give the Committee legal lectures on the definition of "reasonable". I must rest my case on some of the explanations that he has given from his legal background. We understand what the reasonable costs would be, but I am concerned about the additional burden which I have mentioned.
<P>

<a name="50615-12_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, made the valid point, which I am happy to underline, that there may be few, if any, alterations that one needs to make in order to employ disabled people. If alterations are necessary there may be beneficial results. Perhaps building a ramp will encourage disabled customers to deal with one's small business. My noble friend Lord Swinfen is right in saying that the limitations that we are discussing relate only to employment and not to the next part of the Bill, which is the delivery of services. In that respect there is no such limitation.
<P>

<a name="50615-12_para8"></a>We have been over the argument. I have made it clear that we shall give every encouragement to small firms to follow in a voluntary manner the guidance in the code of practice on the fair treatment of disabled people. Any employer&#151;be it a large employer caught by the Bill or a small employer outside the scope of the Bill&#151;will be able to obtain from the Employment Service the help and advice that they require as regards employing disabled people.
<P>

<a name="50615-12_para9"></a>We believe that drawing the line at 20 employees is a sensible place to start. As I said, 80 per cent. of the employees in our country will be covered by this legislation. I hope that if the noble Lord decides to put the clause to the test of a Division, my noble friends will support me in retaining it as part of the Bill.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 7, line 22, leave out ("company") and insert ("firm").
The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment. I am not entirely clear why in Clause 9(5) the specification used is "company" or "companies". I have used the word "firm" which I admit is not perfect. However, there are many organisations besides companies&#151;connected persons, partnerships with a controlling partner, unincorporated associations and so on. The purpose of the amendment is to inquire why the Government feel that they must refer only to "companies". I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   As the noble Lord commented, Clause 9 performs the very important function of making void any term in a contract of agreement which seeks to limit the employment provisions of the Bill, including attempts to prevent a complaint being made to an industrial tribunal.
It is clearly right that in general employees should not be able to sign away their rights. However, there is an important and necessary exception made for certain agreements under which people agree not to start or continue with tribunal proceedings. The clause protects the complainant or potential complainant by providing that those agreements are valid only if an ACAS conciliation officer has been involved or the complainant has had independent advice from a qualified lawyer. It is that concept of independence, as the noble Lord, Lord Carter, pointed out, which is addressed in the amendments.
It is clearly unacceptable for the same lawyer to provide advice to both the complainant and the person against whom the complaint is made. Therefore, the clause provides that advice from the respondent's lawyer is not independent advice. It goes further by providing that advice given by a lawyer acting for a person connected with the respondent is also not independent.
Subsection (5) defines what is meant by "connected" where one of those involved is a company over which the other, directly or indirectly, has a control or both are companies in which a third person directly or indirectly has a control. That is a protection that exactly echoes those in other employment and discrimination legislation.
I understand the point which the noble Lord is trying to make. He is trying to make sure that no one slips through the net in that regard. He is trying to include not only <P>


<a name="column_1930"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1930</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>companies but partnerships and other bodies. The amendment as it stands does not hit that particular target because the word "firm" is too imprecise to be used in that context. The concept of control contained in the subsection is inappropriate to partnerships. I understand the noble Lord's anxiety and his wish to tighten up the existing provision. But, as I have said, the current drafting of the subsection is consistent with existing legislation and we have no evidence that the arrangements are not working satisfactorily or that the gap which the amendment seeks to fill exists in practice.
I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment but if he has evidence of real examples or problems, perhaps he will draw them to our attention and we shall try to address them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. He has answered my point. I was seeking to have on the record why there is the use of the word "company". I shall read what the Minister said and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
[Amendment No. 56C not moved.]
Clause 9 agreed to.
Clause 10 [Charities and support for particular groups of persons]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter </B>   moved Amendment No. 56D:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 7, line 29, after ("capacity") insert ("provided that such benefits are not granted by a charity which has an associated organisation which remits profits to persons who are not disabled").
The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to deal with a particular charity, Motability. However, I was advised when tabling the amendment that if I mentioned Motability and the amendment were accepted, that would make the Bill hybrid and I am sure that none of us wants that. However, I have informed the Minister's Private Office that I am dealing only with the charity Motability.
Motability is a charity and Motability Finance Limited is a private company. When the Motability organisation was set up in the mid-1970s, its aim was to provide disabled people with cars because the Government were phasing out the disabled person's "trike" or "invacar". The leasing scheme operates by the disabled person signing over a sum of social security benefit to Motability Finance Limited. That benefit is now called the disabled living allowance and used to be called the mobility allowance.
In return, for a three or four-year period, the disabled person leases a car which the manufacturer guarantees to service and keep on the road. The problem is that from the outset disabled people have had difficulties with the system. There is a mileage allowance which prohibits frequent use of the car and there are hidden costs. Moreover, only mildly disabled people are able to lease because the scheme does not allow significant adaptation of the car for the use of the severely disabled. Indeed, many disabled people argued that what the scheme was doing was taking a lot of money from disabled people who were then returning used cars in fabulous condition to be resold by the manufacturers.
The response was to introduce a hire purchase scheme which worked in a similar way. A disabled person signed over his benefit and, at the end of the hire purchase, he <P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1931"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1931</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>owned the car. But huge down payments were necessary before a disabled person could take out a hire purchase agreement because the mobility allowance&#151;now the disabled living allowance&#151;did not cover the cost of the repayments.
The other problem was that adaptations to the car meant another massive expense. Therefore, Motability, the charity, became involved in the adaptations. The charity absorbs practically every penny in the charity field in connection with disabled people and motoring. It was supposed to fill the gap and ensure that significantly disabled people became mobile. However, it has not worked out that way. There has been a level of complaint about the lack of service. Most people complained that all that Motability really did was to provide cars for the relatives of disabled people rather than the disabled people themselves.
The current financial position is that each year the Government pay Motability Finance Ltd.&#151;as I said, a private company&#151;&#163;360 million of disabled people's social security benefits. Motability Finance Ltd. is the only lender in the world to have no bad debts. The money is guaranteed by the Government because it is a social security benefit which is paid over. Yet the rates of interest it charges disabled people and its car leasing arrangements are not that advantageous. In addition to the &#163;360 million, the Government also pay Motability Finance and the charity &#163;5.5 million a year to cover their administrative costs.
Two years ago, a disabled person called Mr. Ralph Irwin Brown began to write to Motability, the Minister for Disabled People, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, asking dozens of questions. I have read much of that correspondence which seems to cross between, "You're giving disabled people a lousy deal" and "Who is making the profits?" and "Where are they going?"
In an interview, Mr. Simon Willis, a director of Motability, said that there was some money available for adaptations. It was significant that after saying that&#151;I am sure that there was no connection&#151;he was moved back to his position in the DSS within a few weeks. It was then said on the disabled grapevine that &#163;10 million was going from the finance company to the charity to help it pay for adaptations to vehicles. I should point out that that happened comparatively recently and not at the time when all the problems arose. The charity then announced that it was setting up a sub-committee of disabled people to look at the service being provided. For years the charity had refused to do so. Those concerned claimed that they were always doing as much as they could with limited resources.
We also know that two weeks ago Mr. Peter Lilley, Mr. William Hague, and relevant government Ministers&#151;in effect, the paymasters of the scheme&#151;decided to send in the National Audit Office. Last Friday, Motability's director of finance resigned. I understand that over the years a number of officials have been alerting the Government that the whole system has been riddled with minor fraud. Although it is not a minor fraud, the most obvious example of that is that certain car manufacturers have been excluded from the scheme&#151;for example, Honda and Renault&#151;while others, like Ford, have entire, <P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1932</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>very big, departments which are devoted to the work and which employ major advertising agents to handle their publicity.
People are now asking: how far will it go? How profitable is Motability Finance? And where do the profits from that company go? All of us in the disabled world have believed for a long time that if the corporate side of Motability made profits, the profits would go to Motability. But has that actually been happening? How much profit do the clearing banks make from financing the leasing of cars via Motability? It is a very big business for them. For example, 220,000 vehicles, about 5 per cent. of the new car market, are involved. One leasing expert commented that people with disabilities are paying about &#163;150 too much per car and that "surplus" profits made in that way amounted to &#163;12.5 million a year over the past few years.
The Daily Telegraph obtained accounts of the partnerships with banks set up by Motability to handle its finances&#151;namely, Barclays, Nat West, Midland, Lloyds, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland. Such accounts showed that in 1993 the operating profit from leasing cars was &#163;85.4 million on a turnover of &#163;375 million. Informed sources say that the operating profit last year stood at more than &#163;100 million.
There is also the Motability Tenth Anniversary Trust, formed as a company and a registered charity in April 1989. It appears to have no office or staff of its own, but the DSS contributed &#163;5 million to the trust and nominated two of its trustees. Can the Minister explain why that second charity was formed and why the &#163;5 million was donated to it and not to Motability? Will the noble Lord also confirm that the value of the trust's funds in April 1995 was over &#163;40 million? Further, will the Minister confirm that over &#163;35 million has been received from Motability Finance Ltd. or the banks being a proportion of the surpluses or profits which are generated from disabled people by their use of Motability HP and lease schemes? Is the Minister satisfied that the sole beneficiary of the trust is Motability, or is there another charity?
From all that I have said, it seems to me that Motability and its associated companies have proved to be a very nice big earner for someone on the back of disabled people. There are many questions that need to be answered. I beg to move.

<A NAME="50615-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I must begin by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Carter, on his ingenuity in tagging the point that he wanted to make on to the amendment. It is, of course, a matter of public interest with which I shall deal in a moment. However, perhaps I may actually talk for a few moments about the subject matter of the clause which I also believe to be most important.
As many Members of the Committee will be aware, there are a number of charities and organisations which help particular groups of disabled people in preference to other groups. Obvious examples are the RNIB, which concentrates its efforts on helping the visually impaired and the RNID which helps people with hearing impairments. Such organisations sometimes wish to employ people with those particular disabilities because of their experience or the techniques they have learned in coping with their specific impairment. They may also <P>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1933</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wish to encourage the employment of people with such disabilities by setting a personal example of doing so themselves. Clause 10(1) ensures that such activities would not become unlawful where they meant rejecting people with other kinds of disabilities.
As the noble Lord, Lord Carter, said, he advised my right honourable friend's private office that he wanted to talk about Motability. Perhaps I may just make a brief comment or two about Motability in general and some of the points that he made. We will respond in detail to the noble Lord in letter form. I should like to begin by stating that the Motability scheme has been a great success. During the past 17 years, around 500,000 disabled people have become mobile through the scheme. A good many of those people would be unlikely to become mobile without the vehicles obtained through the scheme. Indeed, the keys to the half-millionth vehicle will be handed over by Her Majesty the Queen at the end of July. Notwithstanding that success, we obviously realise that there is no room for any complacency.
Motability is an independent charity which was set up in 1976. It operates under a Royal charter whose governors are responsible for the operation of the scheme. They have a duty to ensure, through suppliers, that they are securing the best value for money for the disabled customer. The organisational and financial arrangements among the department, Motability and Motability Finance Ltd., have been reviewed to ensure that both disabled customers and taxpayers receive the best value for money.
The noble Lord, Lord Carter, referred to the involvement of the National Audit Office. I must emphasise that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State did not ask the NAO to undertake a study of Motability. The office decided over a year ago to look at payments to Motability as part of its programme of reviewing DSS grant-in-aid bodies. Of course, there is nothing unusual in that process. We welcome the study and are fully co-operating with the office.
The noble Lord also made reference to profit levels. While they are matters for which Motability has direct responsibility, I can assure Members of the Committee that there is no question of the banks making &#163;85 million profit. Motability annually reviews the agreed return taken by the banks. The figure quoted is not profit but includes items such as interest on borrowings which amounts to over &#163;1 billion.
The National Audit Office, which is obviously a fully independent organisation, is currently investigating the Motability scheme. We are co-operating fully with its inquiries. I hope that that sets the scene. As I said, I shall write to the noble Lord, Lord Carter, in answer to the very considerable number of detailed questions that he posed. I am sure that the noble Lord will understand why I have been unable to reply to him now with the detail that he seeks.

<a name="column_1934"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1934</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>situation which needs to be considered. I do not think it was just accident that the National Audit Office examined the charity at this time. I do not wish to refer to all the talk there has been of scandal, misfeasance and the rest of it, but there is much suspicion about what is happening with this charity. It is welcome that the position is being looked at and I hope that now it is in the public domain it will be looked at properly. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carter </B>   moved Amendment No. 56E:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 8, line 26, at end insert:
<br>
("( ) an employer has indicated that a successful application will depend on a medical testing or screening; or").
The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I wish to speak also to Amendment No. 56F. I am afraid that these two amendments go over some of the ground that we discussed on Tuesday. That discussion is recorded at columns 1705 and 1708 of Hansard. The matter concerns problems associated with medical testing, the screening requirements for certain jobs and the problems which can arise when, through an advertisement or otherwise, an employer indicates that a successful application will depend on medical testing or screening or indicates that non-symptomatic conditions which may lead to future disability will prevent employment.
Amendment No. 56F deals with a more subtle situation; HIV/AIDS is an obvious example. It might also apply to epilepsy or to multiple sclerosis in its early stages. One way to get round this problem as regards advertisements may be for prospective employers to state in their advertisements that their company is a disabled opportunity employer. However, of course all employers should be disabled opportunity employers and they should not need to spell that out. There is a problem here and we are not entirely sure how to deal with it. I am the first to admit that these amendments are not perfect. If the Government could accept the principle of the argument and recognise that there is a problem, perhaps after discussion either the Government or ourselves could return with a redraft of the provision.
The point is to ensure that the Government recognise the potential problem which could occur with advertising and interviews. We are not sure that the Bill goes far enough in this respect. It would be helpful if the Government could tell us whether they think it does go far enough and if so, how. I hope that when the Minister replies he will not say that people can apply to industrial tribunals. Of course they can, but it is a lengthy and offputting business.
The Bill is intended to end overt discrimination against disabled people but it will still be possible to discriminate against a disabled person at the early stages of a job placement, such as the advertising stage or later. The Bill's provisions depend upon the disabled person being aware that discrimination has taken place, but it will often not be possible for a disabled person to be aware of and to challenge this discrimination. An example of this is the research carried out by Scope in 1990 which showed that <P>

<FONT SIZE=2>people with cerebral palsy were often rejected at the application stage when they were as well qualified as their able-bodied counterpart.
I should make it clear that the amendment does not prevent the use of medical testing or screening but is intended to prevent the requirement that a successful application will depend on medical testing or screening. That is an important distinction. For example, I am advised that Texaco requires every prospective employee to take a medical examination but the employer&#151;that is the company&#151;is never advised by the medical unit of the reasons why a prospective employee failed a medical. There is a problem here. We touched on these matters on Tuesday at an earlier stage of the Bill. As I have said, I am the first to admit that this amendment is not perfect but it is an attempt to try to get round this problem. It would be extremely helpful if the Government could now tell us whether they recognise that there is a problem, and if so&#151;if these amendments are not the right way to deal with it&#151;whether they can make a suggestion. I beg to move.

<A NAME="50615-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   This amendment covers much of the ground that was covered under Amendment No. 23 which I moved on Tuesday. This amendment might constitute a better opportunity for including the provision in the Bill as it states what one should or should not be able to do when advertising a job. I hope that the Minister will give us more encouragement than we received on Tuesday, although we did not receive a totally unfriendly response. Does not the Minister consider that this is a good opportunity to give clear guidance on what is and is not acceptable in job advertisements?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   As the noble Lords, Lord Carter and Lord Addington, commented, to some extent we are going over ground which we covered on a previous occasion. On that occasion there was a clear difference between us on some aspects of the matter, and I sense things will be no different today. Having said that, I hope that I shall be able to throw some light on these provisions and that that will be of assistance to the Committee because, as always, I am here to try to be helpful.
The key to understanding Clause 11 is that it does not make it unlawful to mention health requirements in a job advertisement because the requirements may be entirely justifiable for the job in question. Employers can be entitled to reject applicants on health grounds. Indeed it may be a legal requirement in certain circumstances not to have a particular health problem in some jobs. Therefore it would be quite wrong to have a blanket ban on employers mentioning health requirements. What is important is to cover the problem of employers trying to dissuade disabled people from applying for jobs that they might be able to do&#151;perhaps with a reasonable adjustment&#151;or stating in advertisements that certain health requirements will be applied and claiming subsequently that the requirements were not applied in practice.
Amendment No. 56F would ensure that industrial tribunals must, in appropriate cases, assume a disability-based reason where advertisements suggest that the employer will not employ a person with a non-symptomatic potentially disabling condition. As we explained on previous occasions, a tribunal can only <P>


<a name="column_1936"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1936</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hear a case brought under the Bill by a person who has or had a disability. Non-symptomatic conditions are not a disability and there will be no cases to which this advertisement could be relevant. As I have already mentioned, we have debated a number of times the merits of covering people with conditions which have no symptoms or effects and we have made it quite clear that that does not fall within our definition of disability. I appreciate that that may not be what those on the Benches opposite want to hear, but at least I have been consistent with what I said before and that is the position of the Government. I do not want to rehearse those arguments again other than to remind the Committee once more that this is not a general anti-discrimination Bill. The Bill is about disablement and discrimination in regard of it.
Amendment No. 56E would ensure that industrial tribunals must assume a disability-based reason in the case of advertisements which suggest that the employer will decide whom to employ on the basis of medical testing or screening. I can see that the purpose of this amendment has more bearing on what we are seeking to do in the Bill. If an employer discriminates on the basis of evidence found from medical testing, that would be caught by the Bill as much as any other discrimination. But we are not seeking to ban medical testing or screening. There are legitimate uses which employers can make of these procedures, as we discussed on Tuesday when we discussed the amendment put down by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, which sought to limit the scope for employers making use of such tests quite considerably. The noble Lord referred to that amendment. However, that is not the same thing as saying that employers must not face certain consequences if they advertise in terms which indicate that applicants must undergo a medical test.
Clause 11 goes a long way&#151;perhaps all the way&#151;to meet the concerns addressed in this amendment. It applies where the terms of the advertisement might reasonably be understood as indicating that applications might be determined to any extent by reference to the successful applicant not having any disability, or not having a disability of the kind the complainant has. In particular I refer here to Clause 11(1) (e). It seems to us that Clause 11 already achieves the result which this amendment seeks. On that basis I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, may feel that his concern has been covered and that he can withdraw his amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   The Minister is absolutely right; he always tries to be helpful but the problem is that he has a varying success rate. His reply was extremely helpful. He has at least satisfied us on the point that he made at the end of his reply as regards what is caught by the clause. Obviously I wish to read what he has said. I think he has answered the problem that we thought we could perceive. In the meantime I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="50615-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Notice has been given of an intention to oppose that Question. I believe that the clause should stand part of the Bill. However, I shall be grateful for clarification because it is ambiguous in its meaning and effect.
Various circumstances are set out in subsection (1). One understands them. However, when it comes to subsection (2) we are told, assuming that a complaint has been made by a disabled person, that:
<P>
<br>

<P>

<a name="50615-14_para0"></a>When I read that I wondered what was to be the consequence of that finding by the tribunal. Was it to be regarded as an aggravation of the complaint or a defence of exemption from it?
I suggest that between now and Report stage the Government should ask the parliamentary draftsman to look at subsection (2) so as to make it abundantly plain and to remove ambiguity. It may be that in discussion of the two previous amendments my noble friend Lord Inglewood made the position absolutely plain. However, both he and the noble Lord, Lord Carter, speak so quickly that I am afraid that my still reasonably alert mind cannot take it in fast enough.

The noble Baroness said: I had expected Amendment No. 57 to be grouped with a subsequent amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, concerned with integration. Perhaps it was our mistake, but the amendments were not grouped. Given the number of significant debates, I shall not move the amendment and shall seek to make my points in the later debate.

However, they are not required to provide that transport.

<P>

<a name="50615-15_para1"></a>There have been a good many problems. The National Bureau for Students with Disabilities receives many calls every year regarding transport problems. It is ridiculous that there are students who are kept out of education because they are unable to get to college because of lack of transport.
<P>

<a name="50615-15_para2"></a>I can give one example. Liz is a wheelchair user. She cannot use public transport to get to college because it is not accessible. Neither the college nor the LEA will pay for appropriate transport for her. At the moment Liz is at home, trying to raise the money elsewhere to cover the costs of travelling to her course. That seems extremely unfortunate. I have details of other cases, but I shall not waste the time of the Committee by going into them. I can assure the Minister that a good many people have this problem, as the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities says.
<P>

<a name="50615-15_para3"></a>I hope that the Government can be sympathetic to this problem. One would not expect unreasonable costs to have to be met, but I am sure that something could be done that would be within the spirit of the 1992 Act. I know that during the passage of that Bill we were anxious about this situation. Clearly, our worries were justified because of the cases that we have heard about since. Therefore, I hope that we shall have a sympathetic hearing. I beg to move.

<A NAME="50615-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Darcy (de Knayth): </B>   Perhaps I may join the debate rather late and support the amendment, which I was supposed to move. I had a transport and access problem myself and I am afraid that I was not present to hear what the noble Baroness, Lady David, said. I am sure that she said everything that is necessary. I declare an interest in that I am president of Skill (the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities). That is probably the last time that I need to say that, not only today but for a week or a month because otherwise we shall all become sick of it. Skill receives many calls every year about transport problems. It is a real difficulty.
I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically on the amendment, or will at least say some encouraging words about how he might issue guidance or follow up individual instances of poor practice. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   As the noble Baroness, Lady David, explained, the problem is that the obligation to provide transport is unclear. There are obligations of a kind, or at least powers, under the Education Act 1944, extended by the 1992 Act, as the noble Baroness said. There are obligations or powers under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. The first is concerned with the duties of local education authorities and the second with social services departments. The result is that each authority is free to argue that responsibility lies with the other authority, and both are free to argue that they do not have the necessary funds.
Speaking from the point of view of MENCAP, having once agreed that people with severe learning disabilities should be able to go to college, and having heard the glowing testimonials of many young people in their late teens and early twenties who have been able to take <P>


<a name="column_1939"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1939</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>advantage of such facilities, it seems to me right and proper that provision should be made for getting them there when they need either special transport or financial help.
As with other amendments, the existing rules constitute a discriminatory hurdle. As I see it, this is not a hurdle which the otherwise very welcome government amendments remove.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-15_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   We on these Benches support the amendment. In speaking in support of the amendment I press the Minister to answer certain questions that need to be answered if the Government do not accept the amendment.
The questions surround the issue of students in further education who are of statutory school age and their entitlement to access to education appropriate to their age, abilities and so on. In many parts of the country, due to the development of tertiary college provision, it is further education institutions which offer the appropriate sixth-form level study. I ask the Minister to confirm that such provision would be required under existing legislation.
Secondly, I press the Minister to support the amendment. There are many courses which are not available to students of statutory school age within the school sector, such as technical education courses and various vocational courses.
I also press the Minister to include students above the age of statutory schooling. Tragically many, particularly but not solely, physically disabled students acquire their disabilities as a result of car or motorbike accidents which occur in their late teens. Therefore, that group of young people is debarred from continuing their education at the statutory school age.
Finally, I press the Minister to consider that denying access because of the difficulty of transport to the further education college may be an unwise financial decision for the Government to take because, through attending such courses, young people who are older students can acquire skills that will allow them to be fully economically active within the community, not only to their own benefit but to the economic benefit of the country. We support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I must apologise to the Committee for not being in my place when the amendment was moved, in particular since my name is on the list of those proposing it.
In order not to repeat what has already been said by other Members of the Committee, I simply state that I am strongly in favour of the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-15_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   I add my support for the amendment, particularly for students living in rural areas. Very often there is no suitable accommodation for them so they have to live at home and travel long distances.
In rural areas, too&#151;my own area of North Yorkshire being one&#151;there are no such schemes as taxi cards or Dial-a-ride. That can involve a tremendous extra expense for students who have to attend sixth-form colleges or colleges of further education.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-15_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Zouche of Haryngworth: </B>   I support the amendment. The inclusion of transport for students with learning difficulties and disabilities within the scope of Part III of the Bill will eliminate the present anomaly where opportunity is an accident of where an individual lives. The division of responsibility between local authorities and colleges can be clarified by regulation. However, the Bill provides an ideal opportunity to resolve a present difficulty: that is, to deprive a number of disabled young people of access to education and subsequent improved employment prospects. Access to education is a fundamental opportunity for those young people to gain an active role in society. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-15_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   Members of the Committee from all sides of the Chamber have put forward a useful amendment. The provision will be of benefit to a group which will gain skills and will therefore not require so much assistance in the future because those people will become employable. They will thus have cash and will be able to purchase services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-15_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Perhaps I may start by saying that I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth) managed to get here on time. I am not sure whether she was making a point by coming into the Chamber and pointing out to me so forcefully the problem of transport and access. If she were not, it was a reasonably well-accomplished accident, if I may say so.
I recognise the apparent attractions&#151;spelt out by a number of Members of the Committee&#151;of linking access to further education courses with arrangements for transport to those courses, as proposed in the amendment. However, that policy would involve separating the statutory arrangements for people with disabilities from those of their peers. I believe that that flies a little in the face of the principles of the Bill. It also threatens to dissipate what are limited resources.
Responsibilities for all home-to-college transport are already clear. Under Section 55(1) of the Education Act 1944 local education authorities have a duty to make arrangements for the provision of free transport where they judge that it is necessary in order to enable people to attend colleges of further education. The duty extends to students attending independent schools and colleges, including those for whom the FEFC has purchased provision. In reaching a judgment, local education authorities must look at the circumstances affecting the individual, such as his or her age and the route to the institution.
In addition, Section 55(2) enables local education authorities to pay the whole or a part of the reasonable travelling expenses of further education students for whom free transport is not thought necessary. I hope that that at least helps the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, regarding one of her questions.
Free transport can range from the provision of specialised coaches, with escorts, to the purchase of bus and train passes. Often the provision made under Section 55(1) is made alongside and indistinguishable from that made under Section 55(2). Additionally, local authorities are able to develop coherent and cost-effective arrangements not only encompassing <P>


<a name="column_1941"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1941</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>public transport, but also provision made by social services departments. For example, they may have a vehicle which they use to transport disabled people to day centres but which can also be used in the event of someone who is disabled needing such transport to attend an FE college.
On the point about keeping a coherent policy, when a person moves from school to college, there will be a continuity of responsibility for his or her transport. That was one of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton. The situation does not only involve moving from school to college. There are also circumstances nowadays in which people who are still at school attend colleges for part of the week for some of their courses. Therefore, I believe that there is a merit in trying to keep all the responsibilities where they are at present: namely, with local authorities.
The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, can be assured regarding pupils of school age. Regarding her first question, I believe that they are covered. I believe that I have answered the second question about pupils who are partly in college, partly in school, or moving between the two.
The arrangements that we have at present, and the associated economies of scale, would be lost were the funding to be transferred to individual colleges from local authorities. There would necessarily be an increased administrative burden which would further reduce the amount of funds available for the transport.
I understand what noble Lords are saying. In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady David, I certainly look sympathetically at the need for further guidance. I can assure her that I shall also ask the Department for Education to look into any individual cases to which she would like to draw my attention. She mentioned one in perhaps a little more detail. We could certainly look at it.
I do not believe that there is anything between us on what we wish to achieve. I think that it is unnecessary to go down the road proposed in the amendment. I believe that it would be a mistake to dismantle an integrated system and separate disabled students from their peers.
With that explanation, and the promise to consider any specific examples sent to me (which I shall pass on to the Department for Education) and with the fact that the department will look sympathetically at the need for further guidance, especially in the light of any examples, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.

There really are problems. I have another example involving an 18 year-old who had to change a course. She was partially blind and there was not the support at one college. She had to move to a college a little further away. The local authority would not pay travel costs <P>


<a name="column_1942"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1942</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because it was not the nearest college. Local authorities probably differ a little in their responses to cases of need.
I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will consider giving a little more guidance. That would be helpful. I am grateful, too, that if we have individual cases for consideration, he will consider them or send them to the Department for Education.
I am sure that we should all like to read what he said and hope that he will deal with the guidance problem. Granted that, for the moment I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
("( ) the provision of services includes the provision of services to a disabled person representing another person in their capacity of parent, guardian or carer;").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: I am well aware that the Government seek to confine the Bill to disabled people. However, the amendment seeks to extend the duty of service providers to provide access to goods, facilities and services to parents and carers.
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para1"></a>There will be, and have been, cases where an able-bodied person needs the assistance of parents or a carer. A perfect example is of a normal hearing young boy in a court of law, needing the assistance of his totally deaf parents. Because those parents did not have any interpretation, they were unable to help the boy, so we required help for the parents in order to help the boy. It is clear that, if we do not get help for people in that situation or in hospitals, then justice fails to be done. If parents have to give their consent or otherwise to an operation which may be necessary in a short time, then we are in trouble.
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para2"></a>The same principle applies to carers. There is a precedent for them because Section 3 of the 1986 Act on disabled persons&#151;a section which was never implemented by the Government&#151;provides that a disabled person has a right to communication support. Section 8 of the Act&#151;also not implemented&#151;extended that right to carers. It is all too easy for us in this House and another place, enjoying the debates and clashes of opinions and views, to be carried away with our words, phrases, speeches, theories, amendments and subsections and forget the realities. The reality behind the amendment is shown from the number of examples produced by the RNIB. The examples deny the pleasant advertising picture of carers being chubby, happy middle-aged ladies, getting a coffee for a smiling disabled person and patting the pillow. I will quote only one of the examples, because of lack of time. A man, Mr. M, is blind and is caring for his wife, who has multiple sclerosis. Imagine that kind of situation: he finds it difficult to obtain information about services for her in a form which is accessible to him.
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para3"></a>There are other examples which I have no time to read. They are special cases which require special provision. I know that special pleading is not popular in the House, but such people are in great need of help <P>

<P>
<A NAME="50615-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I have given a sympathetic hearing to the points made by the noble Lord and hope that I can allay his anxieties by trying to deal with the general point that he makes.
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para4"></a>First, the Bill will prevent discrimination against all disabled people to whom a service is being provided. It will not matter in what capacity a disabled person is acting when an alleged act of discrimination takes place. I will check because it is a serious point and I am trying to make almost a legal interpretation of what is in the Bill. I believe that the example quoted of the blind husband seeking information pertains more to the wife with multiple sclerosis. That would be encompassed by the sentence which I have just read from the brief.
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para5"></a>Where a service would normally be provided, for example, to a disabled parent, that service will have to be made accessible. We are content that, where a doctor is treating a young child, he not only provides a service to the child but to his parents as well. That would include such things as the provision of information about the child's illness and facilities for the parent to accompany the child.
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para6"></a>The Bill will therefore cover many of the situations with which the amendment is concerned, although I am conscious, from the previous remarks of the noble Lord, that he is concerned about education and the provision by schools to disabled parents of information about their children. It may be parents who are deaf and whose children go to school. The noble Lord wishes to be sure that the schools will be sympathetic to that case.
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para7"></a>All education is excluded from the general right of access provisions. However, I am pleased to be able to say that the Department for Education will be consulting on this important issue. Following the outcome, it proposes to revise existing regulations to provide for schools to make information available to parents in accessible formats.
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para8"></a>With those assurances and that clarification of what the Bill means, I hope that the position is acceptable to the noble Lord. Perhaps I may go one step further in order to clarify the matter. If we consider carers, if information is made available to other carers, then it must be available in an accessible format for disabled carers. That confirms what I said about the example that the noble Lord gave of the blind husband looking after the wife who has multiple sclerosis. If information is available to a husband who is totally healthy and normal&#151;using that word, I hope, in a positive sense&#151;then the blind husband also should be able to obtain it under the Bill. I hope that those explanations are helpful to the noble Lord and that he will not only be able to withdraw his amendment but will feel comfortable in doing so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   That explanation is helpful and much appreciated. Although it does not completely meet the points, it is constructive and I am happy to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Doctors owe a duty of care to all their patients, and each patient must be assessed individually and share in decisions about treatment options. Treatment offered must be based on clinical judgement and sound scientific evidence of likely benefit. It is unethical to refuse an available treatment to any patient who might benefit from it and who is willing to have it".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para10"></a>That is clear, although many of us have anxieties about the attitude of GP fundholders. We expressed that anxiety on proceedings on the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. I spoke from the Dispatch Box at that time about our concern that GP fundholders might start to discriminate between patients on the basis of their likely cost. At least the BMA has spelt out clearly that a doctor should not be able to discriminate against disabled patients.
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para11"></a>However, there are other areas of care: community care, nursing homes, residential homes, the whole area of healthcare and community care. We wish to be clear about whether all healthcare services, of whatever kind, are caught by the Bill. The BMA states that its interpretation is that those services are caught by Clause 12(3) (h):
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the services of any profession or trade, or any local or other public authority".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para12"></a>Amendment No. 64 covers the problem in a different place but it has the same intent. It is based on the fact that healthcare seems to be specifically excluded from the examples which are given in Clause 12(3). Is that exclusion deliberate or an oversight? Is the exclusion acceptable, since our concern is covered in another place in the Bill? The object of the two amendments is to clarify the position regarding possible discrimination in providing healthcare and to ensure that all healthcare services, of whatever kind, are included in the Bill. I beg to move.


<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Robertson of Oakridge: </B>   It is my intention to move Amendment No. 64, which aims to alert all who are concerned with health care and the provision of medical services to the changed situation that will result from the passing of this Bill into law.
My amendment, based on wording suggested by MENCAP, underlines that what is now largely a matter of medical ethics and codes of practice will come under a law that will make it an offence to discriminate against disabled people. Incidentally, I saw the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, only this afternoon. It seems to me to be a perfectly possible alternative to my amendment. However, I do not wish to comment on it any further at this stage.

<FONT SIZE=3>
One has to comb the Bill very closely to find any references to these subjects. However, Clause 12(3) (h) mentions,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the services of any profession or trade, or any local or other public authority".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para13"></a>The Minister of State advised me in a letter that this provision extends to include health care and medical treatment. I believe, however, that this is such an important area that there should be an explicit reference to it on the face of the Bill, putting the matter beyond any possible doubt. That is what my amendment is designed to achieve.
In order to inform myself, I wrote to about two dozen leading disability organisations, voluntary and professional bodies. The reactions I received ranged from that of the BMA, which felt that there were no problems of discrimination and was happy with the Bill as it stood, to that of RADAR, which felt that the issue was so big that a separate Bill might be necessary. The director general of one organisation wrote:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If you can, through the Disability Discrimination Bill, prevent medical practitioners discriminating merely on the grounds of disability as to whether they treat disabled people or not, you will have achieved a great deal and we applaud your initiative".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para14"></a>It is not my intention to make a judgment on the medical profession, nor am I qualified to do so. However, I should like to mention areas of concern that have been drawn to my attention. The first is medical treatment itself. Under the Bill&#151;and this will be absolutely clear if my amendment is accepted&#151;it will be unlawful for a medical practitioner to provide medical treatment to a disabled person other than in accordance with best medical practice solely because that person is disabled.
I have had some examples drawn to my attention of instances of disabled people having difficulty in receiving the same quality of medical treatment as others in society. There seems to be a particularly difficult problem in the case of Down's syndrome children. I have heard of several cases where there has apparently been a reluctance to give them the same treatment as other patients. ASBAH mentioned a young girl client with hydrocephalus and some learning difficulties who complained for some 18 months of pain in her shoulder but whose complaints went unheeded. The neurosurgeon who treated her said that there was nothing wrong. However, with ASBAH's assistance, another specialist identified a tumour in the shoulder which was then successfully removed. This story supports the concern of MENCAP that disabled people with lesser medical problems unrelated to their disability can have them ignored or played down by medical practitioners.
ASBAH also mentioned problems that were experienced by pregnant disabled women who had been denied access to a similar level of service and choice to that obtained by other pregnant women. Other groups, such as John Grooms and MENCAP, emphasise the difficulties of getting sufficient support for disabled people following medical treatment.
It would not be surprising if discrimination were to creep into the provision of health care. We are all prone to devalue disabled people, especially the elderly disabled. <P>


<a name="column_1946"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1946</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Moreover, there are times when it is perfectly proper for disabled people to be given different treatment tailored to their needs. But, as MENCAP put it to me in a letter,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"doctors cannot justify denying treatment or offering treatment poorer in quality as well as different in kind from that offered to people in like state without disability".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-16_para15"></a>In a nutshell, it is right to question the value of the treatment for the patient, but not right to question the value of the patient to receive the treatment. That is a complicated sentence. It reads like the old joke: whisky when you are well makes you ill; whisky makes you well when you are ill. If you try to say that quickly, you soon get into a muddle. I shall just say the sentence again. In a nutshell, it is right to question the value of the treatment for the patient but not right to question the value of the patient to receive the treatment. My amendment would put that beyond doubt.
My second area of concern is the availability of nursing care and services. To meet the requirements of the Bill, reinforced by my amendment, there will need to be an improvement in the provision of suitable equipment to meet the needs of disabled people. Examples are pressure relief mattresses, inaccessibility of breast screening apparatus and the lack of hoists in outpatients departments. It would give considerable encouragement to disabled people if the Government were to give a lead by ensuring that hospitals and surgeries were constructively encouraged to provide accessible lavatories, clear direction signs, including signs in Braille for the blind and partially sighted, and induction loops for people with hearing impairment.
My third area of concern is access to GP services. Three organisations mentioned problems that have recently emerged of GP fundholding practices not wishing to accept disabled people as patients because of the potential cost of their care and treatment. This Bill&#151;and again my amendment clarifies this point&#151;will make discrimination in this area unlawful. However, that will not necessarily make the problem go away. I hope that a way can be found to help GPs who are under this kind of pressure.
I hope that these observations are helpful to the Committee. While the problems may not be widespread at present, there is a real possibility that, as the number of elderly disabled people grows and medical science allows disabled people to live longer, the examples I have raised will become more prevalent. Although the amendment raises no new issues of principle, mentioning the matter explicitly on the face of the Bill would provide a clear marker for the future. I shall be interested to hear what other noble Lords and the Minister have to say in response.

<A NAME="50615-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I very much support the idea behind these amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Robertson of Oakridge, mentioned John Grooms association for disabled people, for which I work. Our experience suggests that discrimination can occur in relation to all services provided by the National Health Service, including general practitioners and therapists. When we opened a number of new homes in the Southend area, one large one and three quite small ones&#151;they were opened, I may say, over a number of years and spread quite widely <P>


<a name="column_1947"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1947</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>over the Southend area&#151;we had considerable difficulty in finding general medical practitioners who were willing to have the disabled people in our care on their lists. That appeared to be because they were under the misapprehension that because someone has a physical disability, he or she was likely to be ill more often and therefore to be a greater expense on the practice.
Residents in our Edgeware estate have also been denied community physiotherapy services and equipment, apparently because they live in a residential home. I understand that the local services claim that their budgets are insufficient to meet the costs of providing these services. Talks with other organisations indicate that this occurs in other homes as well. It thus appears to us that there is double discrimination: a disabled person is forced to live in a residential home while at the same time being denied the medical services that able-bodied people could easily obtain. I support the ideas behind these amendments. Whether the wording of either is exactly correct for the Bill, I am not qualified to say, but I believe that we should have, if not one of these amendments, then something similar on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   I have my name to Amendment No. 64 but I am just as interested in Amendment No. 59A. In fact, Amendment No. 59A may be the better of the two. The details could then be put in the regulations.
As the Bill stands, health care for disabled people is not adequately written in to indicate the vital need for medical personnel to understand the needs and problems of disabled people, which I am afraid that many do not. The problems seem to be getting worse. We have now before us an opportunity of highlighting some of the problems.
I believe that it will help educate hospital trusts, their non-executive members and the staff who work in the hospitals as well as medical personnel working in the community if the Bill, when it becomes an Act, has the word "health" written into it. I should like to include "dentists" too. Many severely disabled people, particularly those with learning difficulties, have problems finding dentists who will treat them. To illustrate what I mean, I shall give two examples. I hope that the Committee will understand how important is the problem of receiving adequate health care at present for disabled people.
First, I should like to tell the Committee that, as the Department of Health knows, I have been involved with the problem of pressure sores over the years. Last year the Department of Health held a very interesting seminar on the subject. The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, has answered one of my Questions on the matter in the past year. I am sure that she and I are of like mind over this problem.
Pressure sores cause untold misery to the individual and cost the National Health Service millions of pounds in extra expenses, sometimes as much as around &#163;100 million a year, in staff time, operations and medication. My first example is that of my personal friend, the noble Lord, Lord Crawshaw, who was in hospital at the time of the Second Reading of this debate, as I mentioned. The noble Lord has given me permission to tell the Committee what happened to him.
<P>


<a name="column_1948"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1948</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
The noble Lord was taken as an emergency patient to a large and well-known teaching hospital near his home in the Midlands. He was running a high temperature and had haemorrhaged. Some noble Lords may not know that the noble Lord, Lord Crawshaw, is a paraplegic who does not feel his paralysed parts. When ill, all paraplegics are very much at risk from pressure sores if they are not turned and given special attention&#151;even nursed on special mattresses, as the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, said. The noble Lord, Lord Crawshaw, developed a pressure sore while he was in hospital. It is ironic that he is a trustee of Smith's Charity which at this very moment is funding a research project on pressure sores. Having stayed extra time in hospital, where his pressure sore was not healed, the noble Lord is at home being looked after by the district nurse. But he may well have to go to a spinal unit to be cured. That is why he is not in the Chamber today. We miss him greatly on the Mobile Bench.
My other example concerns a paraplegic lady, living at home, who became very ill and weak last year. The local doctor did not send her to hospital. She developed persistent diarrhoea. When the community nurse visited, she said that she could only be given a bath every two weeks. She was living with her brother, an alcoholic who had had cancer. She needed constant help, which was not forthcoming. When her own doctor came back from three weeks' holiday, this patient was sent to hospital. She died the next day from an undiagnosed ulcer. The system had let her down.
I hope that the Committee will realise how important it is to have health care written in the Bill. I hope that the treatment of pressure sores will go into the regulations. I want to save the National Health Service money and help disabled people to a better quality of life. Having taken sisters away from hands-on work on the wards and given them administrative jobs has not helped patient care. I hope that the Minister will consult with his colleagues from the Department of Health. As the Committee knows, disability crosses all government departments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I wish that I had been able to put my name to either of these amendments. I crave the Committee's indulgence when I speak for a few moments on this matter of unfair discrimination. I do so from a personal standpoint. Some Members of the Committee may feel that, at least within the National Health Service, disabled people will already be protected from discrimination by a system designed particularly for their benefit and by staff who are likely to have their interests particularly at heart. Would that were so.
First, there is institutional discrimination. When I was Secretary-General of MENCAP from 1980 to 1987, a large number of people with learning disabilities were then in large hospitals. It was notorious that expenditure per head on food was a fraction of that spent in general hospitals. I could never discover any reason other than unfair discrimination which would explain the discrepancy. I can only hope that things changed when I became Chairman of MENCAP some years later.
Then there is blatant discrimination based on a sense of priorities which puts people with learning disabilities at the end of the queue. A sister on a paediatric ward to which a child with severe and multiple disabilities was admitted for treatment said, "We really do not have time <P>


<a name="column_1949"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1949</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to look after children like that when there are sick normal children to treat". The high level of untreated morbidity that was found every time that there was a survey of the health of people with severe learning disabilities is a commentary of "Why bother?" on this why-bother prejudice.
A third category of unfair discrimination is the unwillingness to provide the additional support that people with severe learning disabilities may need during treatment. As I said, I can speak from personal experience on this story and the next one that I shall tell the Committee. It concerned an eye operation&#151;she has had several&#151;on my daughter Shelley. It was the first that she was to have and took place some time ago. I was asked to provide the extra nursing cover needed during the recovery period. I had to pay for that. I am happy to say that eventually the health authority reimbursed me but it was after some degree of argument. I can cite other cases where parents have been told by a hospital that they ought to seek private treatment, or that extra nursing cover could not be made available, or that the parents themselves should come in to provide personal care and feeding.
As was touched on by my noble friend Lady Masham, dental problems too provide further occasions of unfairness and discrimination. Many people with severe learning disabilities&#151;my daughter is one of them&#151;cannot cope with dental treatment without a general anaesthetic. It has recently been brought to my attention that troubles with the change of responsibility for dentistry in Northamptonshire meant that general anaesthetics were available only for extractions. I hope that the problem has now been solved, but for some months people's teeth rotted until they had become so bad that they needed those extractions. Again, quoting my daughter's case, she is still awaiting the general anaesthetic at the hospital so that she can have her teeth looked at. That is the state of play that has been going on for some 18 months.
I hope that I have said enough to show why I would welcome assurances from the Minister that the Bill as it stands will prevent the kind of discrimination that I have described.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-17_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I believe that I am a lone voice on this matter. I feel that the amendment as tabled is probably unnecessary. I believe that the health service should now be doing everything and anything that it can do to help people. Certainly I look to the Minister to confirm that that is so. But so many issues have been raised which are bordering on clinical judgment that this is something about which we must think carefully. The medical profession in particular values its clinical freedom, and the dentists no less so. It is important that one should be able to decide what is best for one's patient. Certainly, more and more negligence claims are being filed as people decide that what the doctor chose was not best for them. If that could be proved, it would be a different matter. However, it is difficult to decide whether a person was discriminated against or whether it was simply that the doctor was a bad judge.
The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, quoted cases where I felt that someone was probably in the hands of a bad doctor. I hope that there is sufficient machinery <P>


<a name="column_1950"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1950</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>within the health service to deal with that. But I speak particularly because of the comments in relation to dentistry. Dentistry is a real problem. I know that because I have had personal experience of it. The point made regarding general anaesthetic not being available for someone who required it is absolutely right. In my surgery we could and did give general anaesthetic for fillings. I did many thousands of those for all types of people, some of whom had learning difficulties or other disability. They were not all suitable to be treated in an ordinary dental surgery because some required an expert to ensure that the patient did not suffer a heart attack. People with a secondary congenital heart condition had to be treated in a specialist centre.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for allowing me to interrupt. The case to which I referred concerns my daughter. She is awaiting admission to hospital to have general anaesthetic because of her general state of health.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199495/ldhansrd/vo950615/text/50615-18.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   That confirms what I am saying. Therefore, when the patient comes to the dentist, the dentist must decide whether or not the case is suitable for treatment in the surgery. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, was talking of dentists in general. I had a number of wheelchair-bound patients. I could not treat them unless I borrowed a surgery which was on the ground floor so that the patient could get into it. My surgery was on the first floor. I had one patient who was almost blind and wore heavy leg calipers. She came to my surgery for years and managed to get to the first floor. We treated her all the time and I have nothing but great admiration for how well she coped with double disabilities when most of us would find it impossible to cope with one.
It is a specific problem because National Health Service dentists, particularly in the cities, can only afford first-floor premises, ground-floor premises being much more expensive. An answer may lie in community dental services providing services of that type. I hope therefore that my noble friend will assure me that this is fully covered and that the National Health Service has such obligations already. I certainly would not want to see discrimination against people with disabilities.

<A NAME="50615-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   We have had an interesting debate. I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendments and the problems which have been brought to our attention. The amendments appear to have the effect of making it illegal to discriminate against disabled people in the provision of health services. This is an extremely difficult and sensitive area and I can understand the Committee's concern, though my concern changed at one stage during the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Robertson of Oakridge, when he suggested that we may need another Bill. My heart sank at the possibility and perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, shared my sinking feeling. We do not need another Bill, nor do we need the amendments. I hope to be able, not just to persuade your Lordships, but also place on record what the position is.
<P>


<a name="column_1951"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1951</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
In relation to the specific examples quoted, it is true that, given the size and complexity of our National Health Service, mistakes will be made. That is a human failing. It happens to the disabled and the non-disabled alike, rather like the rain falling on the just and the unjust. It is not therefore a specific problem for disabled people, though I understand the points being made that may particularly affect them. I shall certainly draw the attention of my noble friend Lady Cumberlege to the examples brought to my attention today.
I said that I felt the amendments were not necessary. As we have consistently emphasised, there are no exceptions to the fundamental principle that the National Health Service is there to provide services for everybody on the basis of clinical need&#151;a point made by my noble friend Lady Gardner. We categorically spelt out in the Patient's Charter the right of every citizen to receive healthcare on the basis of clinical need and not on any other factor. Indeed, the National Health Service Executive produced the Patient's Charter in a number of versions&#151;audio cassettes, Braille, large print, video and British sign language, and in signs and symbols for people with learning difficulties. The charter sets out the standards which people can expect of the NHS, including that the NHS will make it easy for everyone to use its services, including children, elderly people or people with mental or physical disabilities. Since the Patient's Charter was first launched in 1991, considerable progress has been made by the NHS in making services more accessible for disabled people.
The Government have specified the improvement of the performance of the NHS for disabled people as a priority in the priorities and planning guidance for the NHS for 1995-96. There have been great improvements in healthcare over the past 20 years or so and disabled people can now benefit from a variety of interventions. Procedures such as hip replacements, which vastly improve quality of life, are commonplace.
These amendments are inappropriate because questions of medical ethics are matters for the General Medical Council and the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) respectively which are independent statutory bodies. The Medical Act 1983 gives powers to the General Medical Council to provide,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such manner as the Council thinks fit, advice for members of the medical profession on standards of professional conduct or on medical ethics",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-18_para0"></a>while the UKCC's powers under the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979 include that of
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"providing in such a manner as it thinks fit advice for nurses, midwives and health visitors on standards of professional conduct".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-18_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, quoted the BMA, perhaps underlining the point that there ought not to be discrimination in the health service. I shall go further and quote the General Medical Council, which issued advice on medical ethics in its Blue Book Professional Conduct and Discipline: Fitness to Practise. This states, under the heading, "Principles governing decisions about access to medical care" that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A doctor should always seek to give priority to the investigation and treatment of patients solely on the basis of clinical need".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>


<a name="column_1952"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1952</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>

<a name="50615-18_para2"></a>That advice was revised on 23rd May 1995 and approved by the GMC council. Its new guidance is called Good Medical Practice which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You must not allow your views about a patient's lifestyle, culture, beliefs, race, colour, sex, sexuality, age, social status, or perceived economic worth"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-18_para3"></a>a point alluded to once or twice&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to prejudice the treatment you give or arrange".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-18_para4"></a>And,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You must not abuse your patient's trust. You must not, for example deliberately withhold appropriate investigation, treatment or referral".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-18_para5"></a>It continues,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You should always seek to give priority to the investigation and treatment of patients solely on the basis of clinical need".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-18_para6"></a>For nurses, midwives and health visitors, the UKCC in its code of professional conduct, issued in 1992, recommended:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As a registered nurse, midwife or health visitor, you are personally accountable for your practice and, in the exercise of your professional accountability, must ... recognise and respect the uniqueness and dignity of each patient and client, and respond to their need for care, irrespective of their ethnic origin, religious beliefs, personal attributes, the nature of their health problems or any other factor",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-18_para7"></a>and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"report to an appropriate person or authority any circumstances in which safe and appropriate care for patients and clients can not be provided."</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-18_para8"></a>This code of professional conduct is issued to all registered nurses, midwives and health visitors by the UKCC. The council is the regulatory body responsible for the standards of these professions and it requires members of the professions to practise and conduct themselves within the standards and framework provided by the code.
Maintaining and defending the highest professional standards in the public interest is a complex and difficult job which goes to the heart of the self-regulatory role which Parliament has already entrusted to the statutory bodies. I do not believe that duplicating that role in another context would of itself add to the consideration that patients are entitled to expect from the practitioners who serve them.
The noble Lord, Lord Robertson of Oakridge, and other noble Lords asked whether GP fund-holders would be able to refuse disabled patients. The noble Lord is correct in thinking that GPs, fund holding or otherwise, will not be able to refuse disabled people because they are disabled. We shall bear in mind the points he raised when we come to issue codes of practice and guidance on the new rights of access.
Perhaps I may sum up my speech by saying that the question which has been raised by a number of noble Lords can be encapsulated as: are all medical services covered in the Bill? Noble Lords may say that I should have answered that question at the beginning and then I need not have spoken for so long. But this is an important issue and I wanted to put a number of things on the record so that the position is clear. To answer the simple question, "Are all medical services covered by the Bill?", the answer is yes. But we believe there is no need to have this on the face of the Bill because we cannot list every possible service in that way. My assurance that the Bill covers all health services given to disabled people is now on the record. I am grateful <P>


<a name="column_1953"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1953</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to noble Lords for giving me the opportunity to make the position absolutely clear. With that explanation and assurance I hope that the noble Lord will be able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   The Minister mentioned the Patient's Charter. What legal value do charters have? Are they not just words? That is the reason why we want "health" written on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Of course they are words. So are all the remarks I make. But the point is that they are words that are backed up, first, by the powerful guidance given to the professionals involved in the health service. That is the first very important point. They are also backed up by various aspects of legislation, including the assurance I have just given that medical services are covered by the Bill. I do not think we need necessarily add one because we could add a number of things which are not specifically on the face of the Bill. We could debate at least until the end of the evening on different issues which people would like to see on the face of the Bill. The Patient's Charter helps to guide patients and tells them what their rights are and those rights are underlined and underwritten so far as concerns this Bill and so far as concerns disabled people by my assurance that all medical services are indeed covered by the Bill.

<A NAME="50615-19_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parks: </B>   Perhaps the Committee will allow me at this very late moment to add that the Patient's Charter is very strictly enforced through the National Health Service Executive and, at the moment, the regional health authorities which keep monitoring the results all the time.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Robertson of Oakridge: </B>   I thank all Members of the Committee who have spoken in the debate for their interesting contributions. I am grateful to the Minister for his contribution. Perhaps I may pick up one point which he made early in his speech. He said that the two amendments would bring the medical treatment under the law. That is not quite right. The Bill brings the medical treatment under the law. The amendments merely make it clear that the Bill has done that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this extremely helpful debate. Their contributions have underlined the need for the discussion we have had and the need for the ministerial assurance that we received. I know I speak for all noble Lords when I say that we are extremely grateful to the Minister for the very full reply he gave and for the assurance that we needed. He referred to medical services. We are talking about health care services, including community care and the whole range. I think it is clear now that our concerns have been allayed and that there is no need for the amendment. However, we needed to have the debate to make sure that it was not needed. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME="50615-19_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office   (Baroness Denton of Wakefield) </B>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 18th May be approved [21st Report from the Joint Committee].
The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the emergency provisions Act contains most of the legal powers necessary to counter the paramilitary threat in Northern Ireland. It provides modifications to the criminal justice system, including the mode of trial for terrorist-type offences; arrest, search and seizure powers for the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Army; and certain specific offences such as belonging to a proscribed organisation. It also provides valuable powers directed against terrorist finances. It contains significant safeguards for those who may be affected by the special provisions.
Seeking its renewal for a further year is not simply a reflex action on the part of the Government. It is a carefully considered decision having regard to the advice of our security advisers and also the admirably thorough and dispassionate report of Mr. J.J. Rowe Q.C., to whom we are all indebted. He concludes that renewal for a further year is indeed necessary. We, regretfully, endorse his conclusion.
I should like to explain why that is our view. We have, for the first time in very many years, a situation in which the terrorist organisations on both sides are not killing people and destroying property. That is to be much welcomed, and the benefits are already apparent. Northern Ireland is now a confident place; there are increased business opportunities and less unemployment. There is an atmosphere of hope which has been sadly lacking in the past. We have a wonderful opportunity to build on this, to look to the future and draw a line under the past 25 years of suffering.
The Government have recognised the ceasefires in many important ways. I shall quote just a few. Military activity has been greatly reduced and two major Army units have been relocated from Northern Ireland. All the roads which link Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic are being reopened. Many security installations have been removed; and it is no longer necessary for police officers and soldiers to operate the vehicle checkpoints which used to cause such disruption to people seeking to go about their business. We are glad to have been able to take these steps and, as the ceasefires continue to hold, more will be possible.
But we have no confirmation of the peace. The paramilitary organisations on both sides remain in being and they retain the capacity for violence. Not a single weapon or item of equipment has been voluntarily given up. The terrorists are still recruiting new members, developing new methods of operation and gathering <P>


<a name="column_1955"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1955</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information on potential targets. They still engage in the most brutal forms of intimidation; savage beatings remain commonplace as they seek to enforce their own brand of discipline; and let it not be forgotten that not all the groupings have called a ceasefire.
The powers we are debating today provide a deterrent against this kind of activity and a means of countering it. They are also a reassurance that the Government are determined to see a permanent end to terrorism. They are being used much less frequently than before, and we all wish to see the trend continue, but our judgment is that they should remain in existence for the time being.
But we do not wish to keep them in place for ever. The Government have always looked forward to the day when they will no longer be necessary. Section 69 of the Act provides a mechanism whereby specific provisions can be suspended and brought back into force by order if necessary. Section 34&#151;the power of executive detention&#151;is already subject to suspension. We hope that it will prove possible for further provisions to be moved into the same category, and we will keep this matter continually under review in the light of developments. This is another recommendation from Mr. Rowe which we are entirely happy to accept.
Let me look still further ahead. It is only right that there should be a wide-ranging look at all the options for permanent counter-terrorism legislation once a lasting peace is established in Northern Ireland. I can now say that the process will include a fully independent review of the continuing need for this Act and the Prevention of Terrorism Act. It is, however, a matter for judgment when it would be right to start this. I have already explained why we have to be careful. It is likely that we shall have to conclude that it will be premature to mount such a review in time for the legislation which will be necessary to replace the current Act when it expires completely in August 1996. If that is the case, next Session's Bill will be explicitly time-limited pending the introduction of entirely new legislation to deal with any residual terrorist threat to the United Kingdom.
This Government are therefore absolutely committed to overhauling the emergency legislation when circumstances permit and a lasting peace has been confirmed. The only question in our minds is when it will be safe and sensible to begin the process. The answer to that question is, sadly, "Not yet".
In the meantime, I should like to place on record my unstinting admiration for the work of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Army and the other security agencies over the years. Many have paid the ultimate price; and many others, and their families, will continue to suffer in years to come. We hope that their task of upholding democracy is very nearly over and that the police force can continue to develop in the service of the whole community.
I should like now to say something about the holding centres at Castlereagh and elsewhere which have played such a central role over the years. The Government have been keen to eliminate the controversy which has sometimes surrounded them. We have in place an independent commissioner, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, who has now produced two annual reports. We have codes of practice concerning the detention and <P>


<a name="column_1956"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1956</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>questioning of suspects. From the beginning of this year, Sir Louis has been able, subject to certain conditions, to sit in on actual interviews.
We can now go further. Having consulted the Royal Ulster Constabulary, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced in another place earlier this week that he was prepared to introduce, in the Bill to replace the present Act, and if the security situation still rendered it necessary, a scheme to enable interviews to be electronically recorded. We all hope that by then such a scheme will no longer be necessary and that procedures will suffice for all suspects; but if recording in the holding centres is still appropriate, it will be introduced.
Northern Ireland has changed remarkably over the past year. I believe that among most people there is a will to consolidate the existing situation and to secure a lasting political settlement. All our efforts are bent towards that end.
But I have to tell the House today that in our considered judgment the powers contained in the emergency provisions Act must remain in existence for the time being. I do not say it with pleasure and I trust the time will soon come when it is safe to dispense with the Act. I hope and pray that terrorism has had its day, but until we can be certain that the threat has been entirely lifted it would be utterly irresponsible of us to drop our guard and this Government will not do that. I beg to move.
Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 18th May be approved [21st Report from the Joint Committee].&#151;(Baroness Denton of Wakefield.)

<A NAME="50615-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cooke of Islandreagh: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for the comprehensive and lucid way in which she introduced the renewal of the order. The order comes up for consideration this evening when the situation in Northern Ireland is quite different from what it was in previous years when such orders were debated. All of us in Northern Ireland have now enjoyed a ceasefire for almost 10 months, and we earnestly hope that it will be permanent and irreversible.
The ceasefire was fully taken into account by Mr. Rowe QC in his interesting and detailed report on the operation of the emergency provisions in 1994. In his report, he faced up to the realities of the situation in Northern Ireland, and I can understand and agree with his recommendations. I wish to support the renewal of the order for one more year. In my view, there is no other way.
As I have said, we have enjoyed a ceasefire for 10 months, but it has been marred by two murders and a continuation of the bestial and brutal punishment beatings which have been perpetrated by both sets of paramilitaries and in which 131 people (mostly young men) have had their limbs bashed with concrete blocks and bars and have been seriously injured. Unfortunately, that is only one indication of the determination of the paramilitaries to maintain control over what they regard as their areas. Everyone hopes that the ceasefire will be permanent but, as yet, there is no general feeling of confidence that it will be.
<P>


<a name="column_1957"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
As the Minister said, the paramilitaries, and in particular the IRA, have not been stood down. In certain areas, they are actively continuing to target individuals, who find that their movements are being watched and, on occasions, that they have been followed on their journeys home. The recruiting and training of the IRA is continuing. Weapons are being moved about. All that is generally known, and is mentioned by Mr. Rowe in paragraph 13. In addition, some groups are stepping up their racketeering and there is evidence of involvement in drug pushing which is becoming very serious. In the Republic of Ireland, there has been a spate of kidnappings of wealthy business people, ransoms have been paid, and a figure of &#163;1 million has been mentioned. There has been little publicity, but it is clear that the IRA is determined to keep its cash boxes full.
On the wider front, Sinn Fein has been conducting a high level and clever campaign demanding to be fully recognised as a constitutional political party. It has been redefining words and phrases. For it, "demilitarisation" means removal of the Army, disarming and disbanding the Royal Ulster Constabulary but not giving up any of its own explosives and arms. In the name of "democracy", it requires Brits out; it does not recognise the wish of the majority in Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Its "democratic" objective is for the island of Ireland to be governed from Dublin by a government of its choice. It blames everyone else and in particular our government for holding up what it calls the "peace process". It has obtained concession after concession. It is now talking to Ministers. They have shaken hands all round, but there is no suggestion that the IRA will surrender arms or explosives.
There is widespread feeling in Northern Ireland&#151;I can say an almost universal feeling&#151;that Sinn Fein and the IRA have had concessions enough. They must now deliver if they are to be treated seriously. If they are sincere about peace, they should at once give up all their semtex.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-20_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Longford: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may interrupt the noble Lord and ask a question. Does he agree that similar pressure should be exerted upon the Protestant paramilitaries?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cooke of Islandreagh: </B>   My Lords, I agree. That applies to all paramilitaries. The semtex is particularly dangerous. It should at least be given up as a starter in the disarming process.
It is easy to understand that Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness are in difficult positions. They have now to persuade the IRA brigade commanders that they must give up explosives and weapons. The Government have been sympathetic to their position. They have shown by action that they wish to help towards peace. All the roads have been reopened. The Army has been reduced, and security has been very obviously relaxed. To make further concessions without receiving anything substantial in return will lose the Secretary of State and the NIO all credibility in Northern Ireland.
In Northern Ireland generally, we now need time as well as peace in which to build intercommunity relationships and mutual confidence. I am glad to say <P>


<a name="column_1958"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1958</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that there is already evidence of such work. The security forces are supporting it and giving all the help that they can. Great efforts are being made to avoid confrontation and aggression. Police divisional reports show that they are moving as fast as circumstances will allow towards assisting intercommunity activities, and they are moving to concentrate upon racketeering and drug trafficking. It is sad and reprehensible that the chairman of the police authority, a salaried government appointee, should condemn publicly the Chief Constable's report before it was even made public. If the allegations have foundation, there are much better ways of handling such matters.
The Minister paid tribute to the work of the police. In the past few days pressure in Northern Ireland has been rising to bursting point. I would say that the Province could explode, because word has been passed down that the widows of the police, Army and intelligence officers who were killed in that crash on the Mull of Kintyre more than a year ago will be entitled to only &#163;100,000 compensation because those officers were not on duty at the time, and the helicopter could be regarded as a common carrier. Therefore under the Geneva Convention &#163;100,000 is the limit.
That is outrageous. I have never felt such a general sense of outrage. I was glad to hear that there has been some change of heart on that during the day. I hope that is true and will be acted upon quickly. The only way to deal fairly with those poor people is to treat each individual in accordance with her needs. Some have more young children than others, greater educational needs, and so on.
The Secretary of State's announcement that he will review the emergency provisions is welcome and important, but I suggest that he should commence the review now when the need, the problems and the difficulties are fresh in everyone's mind. I trust that the Secretary of State will not make the mistake of importing solely experts from outside who come over for a short time and tell us what we should have. It is vital that we have some local people on the review body, and there are many engaged in community work who are well placed to give advice from ground level.
It would be wonderful if in one year's time we were to find that the emergency provisions were not necessary. But, even if it becomes clear that we should be free of terrorist violence, it must be recognised that there are tightly run, well-organised, and technically proficient organisations on both sides which will not go away. They will involve themselves in every racket and money generating scheme, including drugs, that they can think of. They can be expected to continue to pressurise witnesses and to pervert the course of justice in every possible way. It is certain that at least some of the emergency provisions will continue to be necessary for some years so that the police and the courts can put those evil gangs out of business. I am sorry to mention that, but it is the situation on the ground. I am sure that such people will not go away just because there is peace.
In the coming months, it will not be easy. There are various pressures afoot, but the ceasefire must hold without the Government giving any more concessions. The new sense of hope throughout Northern Ireland can <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>be felt. Of the many good things happening, one is the drive to increase employment opportunities, something in which most of industry and the interested bodies are involved. The work to increase employment and the opportunities for employment is being enthusiastically and competently led by the Minister responsible for the economy, the noble Baroness, Lady Denton. Her work has been widely commended and appreciated.
What we need is time for everyone to understand the benefits which peace can bring so that, although we may suffer from some terrorist activity, the terrorists will have no support whatsoever and no safe houses.

<A NAME="50615-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, after that admirable speech I hesitate to speak, but I shall. It is now 18 months since the Joint Declaration, and some 10 months since the IRA declared a ceasefire; qualified, however, by Gerry Adams a month later in September when he said that the violence might be resumed,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"two or three years up the road".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-20_para0"></a>On 9th December last year an exploratory dialogue began between NIO officials and representatives of Sinn Fein. One of the objects of those talks was to examine the practical consequences of the ending of violence.
I think the public expected that such discussions would lead to practical arrangements to enable the IRA, as well of course as the Loyalist paramilitaries, to hand over its arms, and, above all, the large quantities of semtex explosive and such weapons as rocket launchers, neither of which could be considered defensive weapons needed to protect the brave soldiers of the IRA against, for instance, the police.
Such arrangements were, and are, all the more urgent since it is universally accepted that Sinn Fein cannot take part in the necessary dialogue with the other political parties and with the Government, which forms part of the democratic process, until they can come to the table without an Armalite held behind their backs.
On 10th May this year negotiations took another step with the initiation of exploratory talks between Sinn Fein and a Government Minister, Mr. Ancram, and in May also the Secretary of State found himself shaking Mr. Gerry Adams by the hand in the US and, according to Mr. Adams yesterday, had a useful meeting.
What has been achieved since August last year by the British Government, Sinn Fein and the IRA? The great and undeniable blessing, for which every man, woman and child in Northern Ireland and their friends everywhere give thanks, is of course 10 months without a bomb or a killing, apart from two murders by the IRA. It will be said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-20_para1"></a>but there are limitations to that. For what have Sinn Fein and the IRA achieved, and let no one accept the pretence that they are not one body?
The record of all but one of the Sinn Fein negotiating delegation demonstrates an active IRA past. I wonder how Tony Lake would feel if he had to negotiate as a British Minister with a man who openly regretted that his attempt to blow up a British Prime Minister had failed.

<FONT SIZE=3>
Sinn Fein has secured powerful US support, despite the fact that it represents only one-third of the nationalist vote in the North and a derisory 3 per cent. in the South. But it wishes to create and dominate a united Ireland in its image. It is widely compared with the ANC in South Africa. I personally believe that it is an insult to Nelson Mandela to put Gerry Adams on the same plane. It is as though we were to receive and f&#234;te in this country Louis Farakan, or the leader of the Conservative Party in New York state, as serious political contestants for the US presidency.
Sinn Fein now has an office in Washington and the right to raise funds. It has now opened another office in Brussels whose stated aim is to inform the European Union and to persuade it to play a greater role not just in financing the peace process&#151;perhaps, in passing, I may remind the House that we are one of the two net contributors to the EU&#151;but in the political search for a just solution. Meanwhile, we are dismantling checkpoints, withdrawing troops and allowing Sinn Fein to move further and further into negotiation. We are publicly examining the role of the RUC in the knowledge that Sinn Fein's declared objective is to replace it with a people's militia of the IRA's choice. I do not know what effect that must have on police morale.
We are accepting the continuing punishment beatings by paramilitaries on both sides. We know that the IRA continues to recruit and target future candidates for killing. It was said in the debate on this measure in another place that there is reason to believe that the IRA is accessing computer records in the Housing Executive and the Inland Revenue. I refer your Lordships to col. 528 of Hansard of 12th June.
Strangest of all, we are taking, it seems to me, very little trouble to use that useful weapon, the truth. Gerry Adams has said publicly that the question of decommissioning was never raised with him in his talks at the White House. President Clinton said that it was. Is President Clinton indeed going to come to Northern Ireland this autumn to rejoice in his contribution to the peace process? That would be a vintage exercise in cynicism and on a par with the Irish Government's many equally helpful intrusions into our affairs. Lately we do not seem to have heard much about Clauses 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution, nor about Dublin's careful retention of the Offences Against the State Act while urging us to give up the measure that is before us tonight.
Yet, for all this assiduous diplomacy from the US and from Dublin, and no doubt soon from Brussels, not one ounce of semtex has been handed over and Mr. Adams is now claiming that we are jeopardising the peace process by our unreasonable demands. The unionists are, of course, said to be cast with us as the villains of the piece, responsible in their bigotry and their unreasonable dinosaur attitudes for the breakdown of the peace process once the IRA and Sinn Fein have extracted the maximum advantage in terms of concessions by us, which are not reciprocated. Yet it is the unionists who actually made proposals in February this year for an international commission to work out ways of handing in illegal arms.

<FONT SIZE=3>
I presume that that was never taken further by the Government because today's Times reports that Sir John Wheeler is saying,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Government would find ways of helping paramilitaries to decommission their weapons within the law".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-20_para2"></a>The same item reported Gerry Adams as saying that the IRA would not hand over weapons before a political settlement. He also said in the Irish Times this week that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Even a symbolic gesture of decommissioning arms would symbolise an IRA surrender and is hardly a reasonable or justifiable demand by the British".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-20_para3"></a>In heaven's name, what have the Government been talking to Sinn Fein about since 9th December last year? Did Gerry Adams tell President Clinton that the IRA would not lay down its arms until after a political settlement? And if he did not, what precisely does President Clinton believe that he did to advance the peace process by choosing to believe and to give freedom to raise funds to a man who would not know the truth if it hit him in the face? On second thoughts, he said one truth in yesterday's article to the Irish Times. He said that Sinn Fein cannot deliver an IRA surrender.
Why, therefore, are we wasting time talking to Sinn Fein if it cannot deliver. Why, incidentally, do we allow the word "decommissioning" to be used about the surrender of illegal arms? Its use makes it easy for the IRA and its supporters to create a false parallel by demanding decommissioning from the British Army; in other words, withdrawal from a part of the United Kingdom. There is no parallel between the legitimate Armed Forces and the illegal arsenal of the IRA, just as there is no parallel between Private Clegg doing his military duty and the IRA killing for choice.
I recognise the fact that negotiations cannot be successfully conducted in public and that the Government cannot be expected to show their hand. However, I believe that it is high time that we had a debate in this House on an issue of such paramount national importance as Northern Ireland and its future before Gerry Adams' description of it as a six-counties statelet under colonial rule becomes accepted terminology in the White House and elsewhere.
So far, Sinn Fein and the IRA have outmanoeuvred us over and over again in securing international support and in edging their way into the political process without making one single concession. They have not even given to the grieving families the details of where those they have murdered lie buried. And now they are on the offensive again, blaming us for the stalling of the peace process. Already an Irish Times leader is speaking of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"worrying rumours that elements of the provisional IRA in South Armagh and in Fermanagh, South Tyrone, have begun to grow restless at a perceived lack of progress".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-20_para4"></a>Next there will be an incident which Sinn Fein, totally divorced as it claims to be from the IRA, will greet with pained regret and attribute to the intransigence of the British.
<P>


<a name="column_1962"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1962</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Moreover, Sinn Fein continues to persuade the world that it is the only authentic voice of all the nationalists in the North when it is not. I doubt whether any of those Catholics would wish to see a united Ireland run by Sinn Fein and the IRA.
I may be thought to have painted too black a picture. I do not wish not to recognise the courage and good will which the Government have shown and their patience and wisdom in being seen to consider and entertain all points of view and reject none. That has been noted in America, at least outside Tony Lake's office, where the Oklahoma bomb has made people think rather differently about men who make their point with bombs.
But there comes a time when justice must also be done to the legitimate wish of the whole population of Northern Ireland to see a permanent end to violence so that a political solution can be found. The condition that the Government have made is not a whim but a reasonable condition. That is why we must continue to insist that the IRA gives up its semtex. Meanwhile, we must maintain the proper safeguards afforded by the measure before us tonight. We have a right and a duty to protect the peace.

<A NAME="50615-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   My Lords, in 1966, when I was first elected as Member of Parliament for West Belfast, Northern Ireland saw its first sectarian murder. It was carried out by a loyalist paramilitary organisation, the UVF. A young barman, Peter Ward, was shot and killed.
During the 30 years which have elapsed since then, Northern Ireland has seen more than 3,500 terrible murders. I urge the noble Baroness in any discussions that the Government may have with Loyalist paramilitaries or IRA paramilitaries not to forget the deep feelings of hurt which still exist in Northern Ireland among the relatives of those people who were most foully murdered. I am in touch with many of those people. Indeed, some of my closest friends were murdered. The relatives find it most distressing&#151;I know that I do&#151;to see people who served a sentence in prison as convicted murderers now in their pinstripe suits walking up to the Northern Ireland Office and shaking hands with British Government Ministers. Many people in Northern Ireland resent bitterly the place which is now being given to the loyalist paramilitaries and the Sinn Fein IRA paramilitaries.
They have claimed the credit for bringing about the peace and ceasefire in Northern Ireland. They are not entitled to it. The people who are really entitled to the credit for showing great resolution and courage are the vast majority of the people in Northern Ireland. If anybody is to win a Nobel peace prize, it should be awarded to the population of Northern Ireland and not to any single individual, because it was those people who suffered so greatly.
Since I arrived in this House, this is the first time that there has been peace in Northern Ireland. I certainly reinforce what has been said by the noble Baroness in relation to the security forces. The police, the army and other members of the security forces are entitled to a great deal of credit for the present circumstances. It was <P>


<a name="column_1963"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1963</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because of their actions and the support which they received from the overwhelming majority of the population in Northern Ireland that the paramilitaries eventually decided that for however long they wished to carry on their campaign and however many more murders they committed, they were never going to win. That was an extremely telling factor in the paramilitary organisations calling a ceasefire.
Although there has been peace to a certain extent&#151;policemen and members of the security forces have not been murdered&#151;there is still no great peace in Northern Ireland. Guns have not been fired but 131 very brutal, vicious beatings have been carried out by both sets of paramilitaries. The victims of those brutal attacks do not see any peace in Northern Ireland.
When I was a young boy, I remember going to Russia on a convoy and we were issued with balaclavas. It was the first time that I saw a balaclava. We wore them to protect us against the weather on those convoys. Little did I know that I would live to see the day when a balaclava would mean something entirely different; that it would be worn by murderers, both loyalists and the IRA, to hide their faces from justice. The same may be said of baseball bats. As a country, Northern Ireland is not well-known for playing baseball and I do not know from where the people obtain the bats. But again, I never thought that I would see a baseball bat being used as a weapon of war. That is a weapon which is used now to intimidate anyone who does not agree with the loyalist or republican paramilitaries.
In any discussions that the Government have with the paramilitaries, I urge them to insist that the beatings must stop. There can be no peace or involvement with the paramilitaries while they are still supporting such activities in Northern Ireland.
I was extremely concerned to see the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic trying to establish a link between the Private Clegg case and that of the paramilitaries. There is absolutely no link. I do not defend Private Clegg here. He has received massive support, particularly from British Army personnel. But it may well be that they are not aware fully of all the circumstances which existed on that night when that young girl was killed.
It was not an entirely innocent operation carried out by the paratroopers that night. That car was driving away when the shots were fired. When the paratroopers realised that they had made a mistake and that they should not have shot at the car because it was driving away from the scene, one of the soldiers laid down and his comrade broke his leg so that he would be able to say that the car sped past him and they thought that it contained terrorists. Therefore, that was a deliberate cover-up of an incident which should never have taken place. The Clegg case should be treated on its own merits. In reading all the newspapers which have been demanding Private Clegg's release, the British public should be made aware of the circumstances in which that murder was carried out and in which that young girl was killed. They should be made aware of the feelings of distress which exist among her parents, relatives and the people of Northern Ireland. However, any attempt to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>bring about a link between that case and the loyalist and republican paramilitaries who are now demanding release should be resisted bitterly by this Government.
There have been reports in the Irish newspapers of terrorists in prison who wish to be released in conjunction with moves that are taken on the Clegg case. One of the IRA prisoners is a Brendan McFarlane, who blew up the Bayardo bar in the Shankill Road some years ago. Three women shoppers passed by the pub when it was blown up and he used a machine gun on them and killed them. Five people were killed in that incident. The IRA wants to link that case with that of Private Clegg. There is absolutely no comparison.
Another prisoner, Doherty, is also supposed to have a link with the Private Clegg case in seeking remission. He killed Captain Herbert Westmacott and when the army surrounded him after he had killed Captain Westmacott, the very, very brave IRA soldier demanded that a Catholic priest should come to get him out of his difficulty, and the priest was sent for. There is nothing very soldierly or courageous about that.
Another loyalist prisoner is seeking release in the same connection. He brutally and foully murdered a number of people purely and simply because they were Catholics. Those people should not be linked in any way with the Private Clegg case. I urge the Government to resist any attempts to do so. Moreover, it should be noted that if a policeman or a Garda is killed in the Republic and is sentenced to imprisonment, the killer is not given any remission. He stays there and is not released on humanitarian or compassionate grounds.
Therefore, I suggest to the Government that, in any dealings that they have with the republican or loyalist paramilitaries, in particular the IRA, they should demand something from them before they make any further concessions. They should be demanding the return of the bodies of the people whom the IRA have murdered over a period of years. Their relatives have been seeking desperately to find out where the bodies may be so that they can begin the grieving process.
After all, if the IRA or loyalist paramilitaries are asking for a transfer or release of prisoners on humanitarian or compassionate grounds, what could be more humanitarian or compassionate than the return of the bodies of those people who were murdered so foully by those paramilitary organisations? That is one point on which I feel extremely strongly and I urge the Government not to make any further concessions to paramilitary organisations until they see the return of those bodies and the paramilitary punishments stopped.
The second thing that I should like to bring about has been referred to already by the noble Lord, Lord Cooke. I know that it is not a matter strictly for the Minister but it is in relation to the Chinook widows, as they have become known. Thirty nine members of the security forces, who laboured all their professional lives to bring about peace in Northern Ireland, were killed in that terrible accident in the Mull of Kintyre. They had devoted their whole life to trying to stop the activities of murderers' organisations in Northern Ireland. They lost their lives. Many of them left wives and young children. Some weeks ago there was a leaked report from somewhere&#151;and I know not where&#151;that the <P>


<a name="column_1965"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1965</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ministry of Defence had decided to limit the amount of compensation which would be paid to them. In accordance with a provision in the Warsaw Convention, the ministry had decided that it was a civilian rather than a military plane. Where did that come from? That caused great disquiet among everyone in Northern Ireland that the ministry would be so vindictive as to attempt to limit the amount of compensation. Today we are informed by way of a parliamentary Written Answer&#151;and that is not the best way to give information&#151;that there may be a change in the situation.
I talked to one of those young widows, who has three young children. She asked, "Gerry, do you think it is fair that, while my husband was a chief inspector and earned &#163;30,000 a year, the only compensation that I can get is three years of his salary?". If that is the attitude of the Government, it would be a total and absolute disgrace that would never be accepted by the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland. I only hope that the reply in today's Written Answer is indicative of the fact that the Government will be far more generous in treating the dependants of those people who spent all their professional lives trying to bring peace to Northern Ireland.
In that respect, the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland recently made a speech in which he said that, since the cease-fire had come about&#151;which was brought about in no small way by the activities of those who lost their lives&#151;the Government were saving &#163;1 million a month. I believe that the Government should be prepared to be very generous to the widows and orphans of those men who lost their lives in such tragic circumstances.
At present, we have an atmosphere of peace in Northern Ireland. Indeed, I was there last week and I was delighted to experience it. I hope that it will continue. In fact, it has enabled a book to be written entitled Peace in Ireland. It has been written by David Bleakley, who was a former Northern Ireland MP and served with me in Stormont. He has analysed the reasons why there is a cease-fire and why peace will be an ongoing process. I urge my noble friends in this House to read that book. It is written by a man who lived in Northern Ireland, who understands the politics of the Province and understands the feelings of both communities. I was absolutely delighted when I saw the book for the first time at last to realise just how close we are to maintaining peace in Northern Ireland.
I should like to repeat the three points that I made this evening. First, a very generous attitude should be shown by the Government towards the widows and orphans of the Chinook helicopter disaster; and, secondly, no linkage whatever should be made between the Clegg case and the release of paramilitaries. Thirdly, the Government should insist, before any concession whatever is made to loyalist paramilitaries or republican paramilitaries, that the punishment beatings should be stopped, and that those responsible must identify the places where the bodies of murder victims lie and ensure that the bodies can be returned to their relatives.

<A NAME="50615-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McConnell: </B>   My Lords, I support the Minister in her introduction of the measure. The noble Baroness made a very lucid speech that included many points with which I entirely agree. However, I should first like to make two points. I want to see a lasting and enduring peace in Northern Ireland, and I condemn all terrorists no matter what ideology they pretend to be serving.
The situation is now greatly improved. But, as previous speakers said, there is still terrorist activity and those concerned are getting money from robbery, from intimidation and from drug trafficking. In another place the Secretary of State said that from 31st August to the end of May there were 131 horrific so-called "punishment" attacks. I believe it is time that people realised that we are not dealing with a few idealistic people; we are dealing with a determined Mafia which is prepared to go to any lengths.
The threat to civil liberties does not come from the measure we are considering; it comes from terrorism itself, the structure and organisation of which appears still to be largely intact. I am glad to see the continuation of the Diplock courts which, as noble Lords know, are courts where a judge sits alone without a jury in certain criminal cases. I believe that that is important, not merely to ensure that justice is done but also because it would be most unfair to jurors at the present time to be brought in to try cases of that nature. I have in mind ordinary men and women, members of the public, who are selected at random and asked to perform a public duty. To expose them to intimidation and threats would be most unjust.
I support what has been said tonight about the accident at the Mull of Kintyre. I do not know the exact position. However, I have read the leaks and I simply hope they are not true. I say that because I do not believe that this House would wish to see the relatives of such men who were performing a valuable service shoddily treated. When one looks at the damages that some receive for defamation and then at what might well be offered to the widows and children of those men, it seems pretty unbalanced.
There has also been an agitation led by Mr. Gerry Adams to release those who are euphemistically termed "politically motivated prisoners"; in other words, men who have committed crimes of the foulest kind and have been rightly sent to prison. All this is at a time when the IRA and other such organisations are still retaining arms. The idea of letting out men who previously used arms and who might well return to use them again when they become available is an affront to common sense. We have already made too many concessions of that type. It is time that it stopped. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, made a very valid point when he said that we must remember the relatives of those who have been murdered and what their feelings would be if those murderers were let out on to the streets.
I do not believe that it would be any service to the community if we were to remove such measures of protection. Indeed, we would not be performing our duty to the people of Northern Ireland if we did so. Let us remember that most of the measures will not be used if <P>

<A NAME="50615-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clifford of Chudleigh: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may briefly make a statement about the very good speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Cooke, and the excellent steps taken by the Government to continue with the prevention of terrorism Act. I do not believe that there should be any time limit at all on it. The noble Lord, Lord Cooke, said "one year". I do not believe that it is in the favour of the whole of the British Isles to have any time limit.
It should be remembered that we all appreciate how many people have died in Northern Ireland. We have not heard a single mention of how many people died here; how many people were blown up outside Knightsbridge barracks. It is essential for all of us to understand that here in England, we have had people from Northern Ireland coming to the mainland and blowing the blazes out of us. I would say to the Conservative Party, "Remember Brighton". We must not have any limit on this measure. We understand that Mr. Adams is in Northern Ireland and also in the United States regularly. Let the United States understand, by the terrible thing that happened in Oklahoma, that it is not fair on any nation that the IRA or any form of terrorism is given any leeway. A penny from the United States seeped into this country in one way or another brings in arms. We must continue with this Prevention of Terrorism Act.

<A NAME="50615-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   My Lords, this debate has inevitably aroused extremely strong emotions. We have heard some eloquent and moving speeches tonight. I thank the noble Baroness for her introduction of the order. All those of us who work with her know what a consistently constructive role she plays in the affairs of Northern Ireland.
We have heard much about the need to be careful and to be cautious. As will become apparent, I share those views but I think it is probably right from these Benches to be clear about one thing. Anyone who cares, as I certainly do, about fundamental freedoms and basic human rights, or even anyone who places himself or herself in the long and honourable tradition of British civil liberty, will find many of the measures in the EPA intrinsically objectionable.
We are all much indebted to Mr. Rowe for his report. He himself states that the EPA cuts down some civil rights which the ordinary law provides. Such provisions as searches of people's homes, searches in the street, the absence of trial by jury, and other emergency provisions can only be justified, as the title of the Act itself suggests, by an emergency; otherwise they cannot be justified. Therefore the test is whether they are now necessary to protect the safety and the liberty of the citizens of Northern Ireland against an armed terrorist minority who threaten their safety and deny their liberty. That is not an easy question to answer definitively in the new situation.

<FONT SIZE=3>
On the one hand, as many noble Lords have said, there is a blessed ceasefire which begins to look increasingly permanent and there is some political progress, albeit horribly slow and grudging. On the other hand there has yet to be, as the noble Baroness, Lady Park, said, either a symbolic or a substantial surrender of arms of any sort by the former terrorists. There is a continuing and nauseating series of so-called punishment beatings, to which the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, in his habitually eloquent remarks, referred. There have been 131 since the ceasefire; 69 of them republican and 62 loyalist.
On the positive side again, military activity to assist the RUC is now running at only 25 per cent. of its pre-ceasefire levels. On 12th June the Government were able to announce that the first border checkpoint was demolished. Yet again, as other noble Lords have said, on the negative side of the equation there is still&#151;some would argue there is even more&#151;extortion, racketeering and criminality to raise money. Therefore, there is a difficult balance to strike and I have a great deal of sympathy with government Ministers who have to make these decisions. My own judgment is that the situation is still extremely fragile and dangerous and will remain so. However, day-by-day, I do not believe we are any longer looking at a full-blown emergency. We should ask ourselves this question. Faced with the situation today as if it had just come about rather than being the product of 25 bloody years, would we really be introducing today such draconian legislation? The answer is, "Probably not". On the other hand, we do not start with a clean sheet. We have to start, as so often in life, from where we are.
In the circumstances we on these Benches will support the Government tonight for two reasons. First, we believe that change should run just behind the security situation rather than running well ahead of it. Secondly, we think that these powers should be reviewed independently, comprehensively and objectively rather than being suddenly removed by this House or by Parliament in a political spasm which would neither be prudent nor give the right signals. On the question of the right signals I would say to the noble Baroness that we believe it would be the greatest possible folly to allow any of these powers to become bargaining counters in a so-called negotiation with Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness, or for that matter with the former loyalist paramilitaries. They are either objectively needed or they are not. We would much rather see a comprehensive and independent review ending in a substantial reduction of special powers in the new situation and perhaps consolidation with a much reduced Prevention of Terrorism Act than any piecemeal series of ad hoc bargains. The noble Lord who spoke before me referred to the question of timing, as did the noble Lord, Lord Cooke. I say that the review should start sooner, say on the anniversary of the ceasefire, in time to influence the 1996 legislation. I hope that when the noble Baroness responds she can give us some idea of timing and of whether we have to wait until 1996 for the start of a review.
I wish to raise one or two specific points about the order. I welcome the fact that, as Mr. Rowe recommended, and as the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, before him recommended&#151;as the noble Baroness will know, I have consistently pressed for this in the House&#151;<P>


<a name="column_1969"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1969</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we are now going to have taping of terrorist suspect interviews. I wonder whether the noble Baroness can tell me whether the term "electronic recording" includes video as well as audio. Why cannot this start right away rather than when the current Act is replaced?
I move on to the question of internment. I am slightly confused here because Mr. Rowe, in his previous report, called for an entirely new EPA which would combine the current EPA and the PTA without powers for internment whereas in his latest report&#151;the one we have before us now&#151;he is calling for the Act to be renewed as it stands (as we know) but for internment powers to remain lapsed. I would say from these Benches that we believe that internment powers in Northern Ireland are, and have been proved to be, counter-productive and that they should not remain on the statute book.
There is the question of the so-called Diplock courts, to which several noble Lords have referred. I am quite clear that the time has not yet come for the trial of scheduled offences by jury. However, there continues to be considerable public disquiet in Northern Ireland about Diplock courts as they are currently constituted. We on these Benches have consistently called for three judges to sit, not one. I believe that there are now compelling reasons why that system should be introduced. Mr. Rowe, in his report, argues that a move to a three-judge Diplock court would result in three times the number of interjections, and that consequently with the weight of business the courts could not cope. But, of course, since the ceasefire, the weight of business has fallen considerably. There are now 130 scheduled cases awaiting trial whereas there were 382 in September 1994. I myself believe that interjections in cases of such considerable gravity are not necessarily a bad thing; after all, that is what judges are for. However, I wonder whether the Attorney-General might not decide, perhaps with the onus on him to explain, which cases need Diplock trials rather than those which do not.
Turning to the question of terrorist funding, I believe this to be an exceptionally serious issue. I wonder whether the Government will consider the consolidation of all legislation dealing with terrorist funding. As the noble Baroness will know, since August 1994 nearly &#163;1.5 million has been stolen during armed robberies on behalf of proscribed organisations and there have been vicious attacks, to which noble Lords have referred, directly related to loyalist and republican racketeering activities. Therefore, when Parts I, II and III of the emergency provisions are no longer needed there is likely still to be, sadly, large-scale financial crime in Northern Ireland. We must have adequate legal measures to combat that. While Sections 82 and 83 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 go some way towards strengthening anti-racketeering powers, we believe that current legislation needs to be consolidated.
I move on to the question of custody time limits, which I have raised previously in this House and with the noble Baroness. Mr. Rowe suggested in his February report that if a time limit were to be introduced from the time of remand to committal it should be reduced from 38 weeks to 10 weeks, in line with the rest of the United Kingdom. With the time spent in custody on remand decreasing now <P>


<a name="column_1970"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1970</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that there is a lighter burden of cases in Northern Ireland, would it not now be practical to have normal custody time limits? As a matter of information, the number of suspects being questioned about offences connected with terrorism has reduced by two-thirds since the ceasefire.
I turn now to the question of remission. The question of prisoners is one of the most sensitive of all. I should be very surprised if it is not more important for the former terrorists to deliver results in terms of prisoners&#151;their core constituency&#151;than in any other respect. I do not believe that there can be any question of a general amnesty, for the reasons of hurt which several noble Lords have described. However, that should not stop us bringing the treatment of prisoners in Northern Ireland more into line with the rest of the United Kingdom. I warmly welcome the extension of compassionate leave by the Secretary of State, which is apparently contemplated as the first of a number of measures to deal with prisoners in Northern Ireland.
Would it be possible to address the question of a pre-release programme? Currently prisoners get pre-release parole in the last year of their sentence. Could that be extended to allow prisoners to be eligible in the last 18 or 24 months of their sentences? The current Christmas and summer release schemes which allow prisoners home for fixed periods could be extended. I believe that that is an area in which the Government could show humanity without in any way condoning the actions of people who are in gaol for horrendous offences.
Finally, like other noble Lords I should like to mention the role of the RUC. The RUC is responding to the ceasefire in a most impressive way. It is worth noting that the percentage of Catholics now applying for jobs in the RUC has risen from 12.2 per cent. to 21.5 per cent. That is a notable step forward in commanding the support of the whole community for the RUC and making it what the IRA does not want it to be, the police force of the whole community. The RUC is having to respond to major changes in its role and deployment, which is difficult for any organisation, in a most constructive way. It is rising well to the challenge. It is appropriate, and I wish to join with other noble Lords, to express appreciation of what the RUC has achieved.
It is Parliament's duty to assist a very difficult, step-by-step return to a decent civil society in Northern Ireland. That is certainly something that the long-suffering people in Northern Ireland deserve. It will require both imagination and prudence. I hope that the Government continue to exhibit both.

<FONT SIZE=3>
A long time ago, in 1992, the Secretary of State made his notable Coleraine speech:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the event of a genuine and established cessation of violence ... the emergency legislation would have served its purpose. Normality could return".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-20_para5"></a>The philosophy behind that speech must be that the present provisions are a distortion of legal and political activity. They distort political life. They can be justified only on the basis of proved and demonstrated state necessity. The real question is whether that proved necessity still remains in that form.
In his report, to which I pay tribute, Mr. Rowe indicated that any new EPA should not contain the power of internment. Is that the Government's view? Sir Louis Blom-Cooper has further recommended the electronic recording of interviews with suspects under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Mr. Rowe agrees. Is that to be put in hand?
Will the review, which is so urgently needed, be fully comprehensive? I urge the Government to take at least three steps in that regard: first&#151;and I respectfully concur with what the noble Lord, Lord Cooke of Islandreagh, said&#151;to announce that the review is to commence in the immediate future, as there is no time to be lost and no useful purpose to be served in putting it off; secondly, to entrust that inquiry or review to a senior judge, not a senior lawyer; and, thirdly, to consider carefully whether the assistance of at least one assessor with intimate knowledge of Northern Ireland should be obtained so that that assessor could sit with the judge to assist in the work of sifting evidence and coming to a conclusion.
There has been a significant but not complete fall in terrorist violence. There are serious questions as to whether the full continuation of this legislation is causing serious wounds to political and judicial life. There is no sensible reason for believing that the Diplock courts could be done away with overnight. I have spoken to no one who has any knowledge or sensible regard for the administration of law who believes that. But doing away with Diplock courts must be the terminus of our endeavours.
Bearing in mind the general good will and the support that we have given to the Government on the general conduct of business in Northern Ireland, we should avoid the tendency to put off the general review of the PTA and EPA. We would end up yet again with legislation which was not properly considered and, more to the point, not justified or necessary.
I mean no disrespect to the importance of this occasion, but we have discussed these matters in similar circumstances on many previous occasions. The rule should be that no infringement of a citizen's liberties, no impeachment of anyone's civil rights should be tolerated by this House without clear, demonstrable reasons for retaining all the sections or re-enacting them in due time.
I believe that there is general agreement that the review needs to start immediately. It does no service to the people of Northern Ireland to put it off until 1996.

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1972</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Northern Ireland, perhaps I may say that in this House we compensate for our limited numbers by the quality of the contributions made by each and every noble Lord on this issue. Like the noble Lord, Lord Williams, I am conscious of the business which follows, but I also recognise that this is a crucial issue for Northern Ireland.
I shall seek to address many of the points raised. I shall read carefully the Official Report. If I have missed any points, I shall write to your Lordships.
Many major issues were raised. I thank noble Lords for recognising that the decision that we have taken is not one that any of us welcomes having to take, but is a necessary decision. Perhaps I may assure the noble Lord, Lord Cooke, that we are not in the business of making concessions. We are reacting to a new climate. We are reacting to a change which those of us who live in Northern Ireland can so easily experience now. I was delighted to hear that that was what the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, found on a recent visit. However, no action that has been taken is irreversible. Decisions have been taken from the point of view of security, not on political grounds.
Noble Lords have great concern about the timing of the review. It is important. It must be independent. The nature of its constitution&#151;obviously the views expressed tonight will be taken into account&#151;is an important issue. If your Lordships wish to add to those views, we shall be happy to hear them.
However, if we were to start now the process would involve "if" and "as" and "when". It is important in considering the value of the review that we should be in a more stable situation. The moment the time is considered right, decisions on the review can be taken.
That applies to many of the points raised tonight. The noble Lord, Lord Cooke, recognised the privilege of my job in Northern Ireland. Jobs are the best cement for peace. We continue to use every effort we can to cement that peace.
I can well understand the frustrations expressed by my noble friend Lady Park. Perhaps I may assure her and noble Lords on the other side of the House that we do not accept punishment beatings. We and the police work tirelessly to try to bring those to an end. They must come to an end. I find it terrible that the noble Lord, Lord Holme, can actually quote a league table of beatings. It is totally unacceptable.
Whatever my noble friend's frustration, arguments with words are infinitely better than killings. We have constantly to be aware of that. I understand her frustration when our European money is being used to support an office for Sinn Fein in Brussels. My own personal frustration is that, as Sinn Fein travels the world fund-raising, I wish that it would seek to persuade its "friends" to look at inward investment in Northern Ireland. If Sinn Fein could attract people to invest and create employment in Northern Ireland, we should see some evidence of value; there is no such evidence at present. However, we were grateful to President Clinton for his insistence at the Washington Conference that decommissioning is important.
I am sure that my colleagues will be equally pleased to hear of the recognition of the work being done by the RUC. Continuing peace will require the police service to <P>


<a name="column_1973"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1973</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adapt to new circumstances. The chief constable, the police authority and the Government welcome the opportunity that that will provide, and the way in which there is already response from the RUC. The noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, rightly draws attention to the importance of the fact that more Catholics are applying to join the force. We need to make progress.
I say this categorically to the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, on the issue of Private Clegg. That matter will be treated independently according to the requirement of the law. There can be no question of the outcome being bartered, balanced against or whatever. Everyone in Northern Ireland is subject to rule of law. There are no exceptions. Nor can exceptions be made in any circumstances. I hope that that will reassure the noble Lord.
Perhaps I may take up another point which many noble Lords raised: the reflection of the enormous concern in the Province for the position of the widows of those people so tragically killed in the Chinook disaster. I am sure that I express the view of every single person in this House in sympathising very greatly with those incredibly brave women and their families. I had the privilege to attend the memorial service. I have rarely seen such courage and strength as was displayed on that occasion.
I am delighted to say that the story which caused so much concern is, like so many leaks, half a story. The legal advice to government was that the Government's liability in respect of passengers is limited by the Carriage by Air Act Order 1967. I can assure your Lordships that the Government's view is that the limits set out in the order are too low. Therefore MoD will consider compensation claims in excess of the Act's provision. Therefore the story was not as presented.
Perhaps I may also point out that the Prime Minster has pledged to take a personal interest in the Chinook widows' compensation claim and has said that he will set out in writing the thinking behind any compensation made to the widows of those who died in the helicopter crash. I hope and believe that that should totally reassure your Lordships on that issue.
My noble friend and others questioned the negotiation on decommissioning of arms. We are pressing to achieve three aims: a willingness in principle to disarm progressively; a common practical understanding of the modalities&#151;that is to say, what decommissioning would actually entail; and, in order to test the practical arrangements and to demonstrate good faith, the actual decommissioning of some arms as a tangible confidence-building measure and to signal the start of a process. That is essential, it is important, and there can be no going back from it.
The noble Lord, Lord Fitt, said, so accurately, that the peace belongs to the people. The noble Lord, Lord McConnell, joined with him in pointing out how deep is the pain of so many people in Northern Ireland. There can be no hurrying of the time that it will take for those wounds to heal and for forgiveness to enter into thoughts. It is not for us to try to speed that up; it is for individuals. But perhaps I may agree with the view expressed tonight that the return of the bodies in situations where families are not aware of the resting place of their loved ones would help greatly in the process.

I should like to assure the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, too, that the savings made&#151;I may question the figure he quoted&#151;are being used in Northern Ireland. I am pleased that some of that fund is being used to build a community work programme for the long-term unemployed. That is a commitment that we have made.
The Government are delighted that this House recognises the risk that would probably extend to juries in the current climate. We would not wish that risk to continue. I stress that there are no political prisoners in Northern Ireland, only criminals.
I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, for pointing out that the pain is not limited to Northern Ireland: many in the United Kingdom have suffered just as grievously. That should not be forgotten and their contribution and that of their families towards showing that violence is no answer to any question is evidence of how far we have gone. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Holme, that innocent people have human rights too. When we consider the situation, the protection of the innocent is not always taken into account.

<A NAME="50615-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Baroness cares to study the early part of my remarks, she will find that I made that very point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, I apologise if I missed it. The point is important and I am delighted to know that the noble Lord said that. It is important that we consider the needs of the majority in Northern Ireland and that the powers should exist but only be used in an emergency. There is every evidence that that has happened. We would not expect to bargain in any situation, we would look to react to the facts and the climate. We would not wish to act in a piecemeal fashion on any issues and I believe that that is the answer to the questions raised by the noble Lord about needs in specific areas.
I shall look more closely at the issues raised and will write in detail if there is a need. I believe that we should consider the whole issue, examine the future for Northern Ireland and then bring forward the opportunities. The issue of electronic recording still has to be examined, but it requires legal action and then legislation. There is a timetable for it, which is why it is not easily possible now.
I have concentrated tonight on explaining why we consider the Act still to be necessary and outlining our future intentions. As noble Lords have confirmed tonight, there is still a strong latent threat from terrorism and while that remains we shall retain the appropriate powers to deal with it. As has been the case over the years, those powers will continue to be exercised with sensitivity and with due regard to all the safeguards which are so necessary in a democratic society. We keep under consideration the possibility of suspending them and, at the appropriate time, there will be a wide ranging and totally independent review of the need for the Act and for the Prevention of Terrorism Act which is, of course, the responsibility of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary.
I hope that tonight has made it clear that our response to the cease-fires has not been in any way grudging or tardy. We have made many welcome and some quite <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>major adjustments to our security profile. We all hope that continuing action in the area to the benefit of the normal way of life for the people of Northern Ireland is possible. But for the time being the emergency provisions Act must remain in existence as an insurance against the resumption of violence and as a deterrent against those who are still involved in paramilitary activity. We owe the people of Northern Ireland no less. I commend the order to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, perhaps I may trespass on the time of the House for a second. As the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, said, there are widows waiting in darkened houses wanting to know their position. Will he be able to telephone them tonight to say that they will be compensated on the full basis of civil liability?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord understands and as I hope I made clear, the story which distressed not only the widows but every person in Northern Ireland, that there would be a limit of &#163;100,000 on their compensation, is not true. The issue of compensation is a matter now between the MoD and the widows and their representatives. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, can give comfort to the widows tonight. I commend the order.
On Question, Motion agreed to.

<a name="50615-21_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: I wish to move Amendment No. 60 and in doing so to speak to Amendment No. 68. Their purpose is to simplify and clarify the wording of parts of Clause 12.
<P>

<a name="50615-21_para2"></a>Amendment No. 60 removes from Clause 12(3)&#151;the list of examples of services covered by Part III&#151;the words "subject to any regulations". The provision is superfluous and might be read as creating a power to make regulations affecting the examples. The Government have no intention of making such regulations and the amendment clears up any potential for confusion.
<P>

<a name="50615-21_para3"></a>Amendment No. 68 seeks to make clear that there is a regulation-making power in subsection (5) which can be used to narrow the exemptions for education, transport vehicles and, should further exceptions prove necessary, other services. The amendments improve the wording of the Bill and I trust that the Committee will support them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-21_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham </B>   moved Amendment No. 65:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 9, leave out lines 26 to 28 and insert:
<br>
("( ) For the purposes of this Part, references to a service provider who discriminates against a disabled person shall include references to a service provider who&#151;
<br>
(a) treats a person who has a physical or mental impairment that does not have a substantial and long term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day to day activities, as having a substantial and long term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day to day activities;
<br>
(b) treats a person who does not have a physical or mental impairment as having a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day to day activities.").
The noble Baroness said: I should like to explore this amendment even at this late hour because it raises an issue on the first section of the Bill. It concerns perceived effects. In the Bill the Government have such a tough definition of disability in terms of substantial adverse long-term effects that many people will experience discrimination because of their partial disability or because of a perception of disability but they will not be protected in the field of goods and services.
We argue that if a person had a major disability&#151;for example, an impairment which had a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out daily activities&#151;and because of it he would experience discrimination, he would be protected under the law. However, if a person had a minor disability which did not substantially affect his daily activity but the employer falsely believed it would, that person could experience discrimination and would not be protected under the Bill. Worst of all, if a person had no such disability but had a reputation for it&#151;for example, a mental health problem or a perception about HIV&#151;and experienced discrimination, that person would have no protection under the law. I suggest that if there is one thing worse than being discriminated against because a person has a severe disability, it is to be discriminated against when a person is thought to have a severe disability but does not.
In Committee on Tuesday we discussed this problem largely in relationship to employment. Many Members of the Committee on all sides of this Chamber recognised that there was a problem, even if the amendment perhaps did not appropriately or entirely respond to it. The Minister argued on the one hand then that employers were entitled to exercise judgment or discretion. On the other, he argued that he could not in any case enter into the field of perception. That was his argument for asking the Committee not to take the amendment further.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1977"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1977</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
We did not accept then that the Minister's response was valid in the field of employment. We shall return to it. We believe that it is even less valid in relation to the provision of goods and services. In employment, at least the situation is competitive. A judgment has to be made as to which one out of four or 40 people may get a job. We recognise that an issue of judgment and discretion is more likely to come into play. However, with goods and services the question of competition seldom arises. People do not have to choose one person over another and exercise judgment which makes it difficult to challenge perception. Goods and services are for general consumption. We are talking about access to public buildings, accommodation, employment agencies, places of recreation and the like.
There can surely be no justification for discriminating on grounds that judgment be exercised in this field. Whether someone has a substantial impairment, a minor impairment, or merely a false reputation for having an impairment, in none of those cases should discrimination be experienced in the field of goods and services. For those reasons, I beg to move this amendment.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   I support this amendment for the many reasons that the noble Baroness stated. If you are providing a service and you fail to serve a customer, you deny that person something absolutely. As the noble Baroness said, there is no chance of being able to come back on this matter on grounds of competence. It is usually a snap decision. Examples are: providing a hotel room, serving somebody from behind a shop counter or something of that type. If a person is denied, he or she has no recompense and their life can be destroyed.
If we put the provisions of this amendment, or something very like it, on the face of the Bill, it would stop people being able to discriminate against a person carrying out the most mundane parts of their life. We are not talking of a job, where there is a structure that can be returned to. It is almost inconceivable to take legal action against everybody who refuses to serve you in a shop. If your local shop refuses to serve you and you take legal action against it, first, the shop may not be there at the end of it and certainly you may have to walk further to get your groceries. This is the type of nasty, petty discrimination that we are dealing with here. I certainly hope that the Government will be able to respond favourably to this amendment.

<A NAME="50615-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I do not intend to repeat at length the remarks made that I made on Tuesday when the noble Baroness sought to extend the coverage of the whole Bill to people who are only perceived to have a disability. Noble Lords will remember that I pointed out that the Government are determined to keep the definition of disability as close as possible to the commonsense view of what constitutes a disabled person. It would be extremely difficult to establish legally what was in the mind of the service provider who is accused of having "perceived" a disability. Any such change would confuse an already complex definition and leave it totally unclear as to who is and who is not covered by the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_1978"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1978</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
As I mentioned on a number of occasions on Tuesday, this is not a general anti-discrimination Bill. In my view, these arguments are every bit as valid for service providers in Part III as they are for employers in Part II. I do not accept the argument that suggests that it is more important to consider what a service provider thinks on the grounds that, unlike an employer, he is unlikely to have details of his customer's impairment, or lack of one. In my view, the fact that he will nearly always be acting on first impressions makes it more important, not less, that we have a commonly understood definition. The absence of material evidence about a person's impairment, or lack of one, would leave service providers more vulnerable to spurious actions brought by people who claimed to have been perceived as disabled. In any case, the very fact that a service provider will usually be acting on the evidence of his eyes will mean that people who have a minor impairment but who are not disabled for the purposes of this Bill, and of course people who have no disability at all, are generally unlikely to be treated any differently than any other member of the public.
Finally, the noble Baroness's amendment would seek to remove the subsection that confirms that the provision in Clause 28 which enables people to bring actions where they have been victimised applies to able-bodied people and disabled people alike. The prohibition of victimisation against those who have, for example, given evidence in court in support of a disabled person who had previously been discriminated against is an important element in the Bill and corresponds to a similar provision in race and sex legislation. In fact one could argue that the provision is all the more necessary in disability discrimination legislation because the victims will often be among the most vulnerable in society.
I do not suppose that I have surprised the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and the noble Baroness by indicating that they have failed to convince me on this issue, just as they failed to convince me on the related issue of employment. I hope, having explained the position and in particular pointed out what I suspect is one of the unintended consequences of the amendment, that the noble Baroness with withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The Minister will not be surprised that again I am disappointed. I thought that with goods and services we had moved into a different area from employment, one where judgment and choice in a competitive situation did not apply. I thought that the Minister would be more supportive of the amendment in this context.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para0"></a>The Minister said that this is not a general anti-discrimination Bill. I agree. But we are trying to make it a general anti-discrimination Bill in the context of discrimination against those with a disability, whether the disability is substantial or moderate, or whether it is merely the perception of disability, in the field of goods and services. I am very unhappy with the Minister's response. I wish to seek the opinion of the Committee.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-22_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 70, 90, 91 and 92. Amendment No. 150 does not need much speaking to.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para6"></a>The purpose of Amendments Nos. 69 and 70 is to bring further and higher education into the Bill. Without these amendments it would be quite legal to discriminate unreasonably on grounds of disability in the field of education, unlike employment and other services.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para7"></a>I should like to say at once that this is a probing amendment to promote discussion and consider why we believe that it is necessary, what is "reasonable" in the field of education and how we could contain costs. That is why I was initially reluctant to group these amendments with the government amendments. However, I agreed, and I shall keep my remarks separate. I hope that they do not seem too muddled or too lengthy.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para8"></a>Skill, whose 21st birthday occurs this year, had the opportunity to look back and see what progress had been made over those years. It believes that there has been huge progress and that colleges and universities should not feel too concerned about bringing further and higher education into the Bill. Skill has had letters from further education colleges wanting further education to be included in the Bill. There are many good institutions of further and higher education which make overall long-term strategic plans and meanwhile respond to the needs of individual students. But some other institutions are less good. The government amendments are welcome and go a good deal of the way to cover strategic planning. Amendments Nos. 69 and 70 are needed to help individual students who encounter problems before and after entering college.

<FONT SIZE=3>falling off and holes developing in the pockets. We need both amendments. I can give the Committee examples of the problems that occur for students in higher education and the reasons why I feel the amendments are necessary.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para10"></a>In further education students are still turned away unnecessarily from local colleges because of their disability. Sometimes the colleges are unwilling to make small changes to buildings and there are examples of students not receiving the support when they enter that they were originally promised. In relation to higher education, one medical school has a policy not to admit dyslexic students. One applicant who did not disclose her dyslexia on admission was accepted but was refused modifications to her exams. Those are the sorts of modification that would have been allowed on any other course in the institution. Is the medical school acting unreasonably in those cases? Its blanket policy of discrimination is unreasonable. There are effective and successful dyslexic doctors&#151;that may explain their writing&#151;but that is not the point. The individual student is also experiencing unreasonable discrimination in that she will not be able to prove her worth if she is not given the wherewithal to complete her exam.

<a name="50615-22_para11"></a>Many problems are to do with exam time, the difficulty in papers being produced in large print or on coloured backgrounds for people with dyslexia, and separate rooms and an extra invigilator not being made available. If one is given extra time to do an exam, it is disrupting if everyone else leaves half an hour before the end. After five minutes of disruption it is often difficult for the student to settle down again.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para12"></a>Everyone is worried about costs. But we must remember that it is only unreasonable discrimination that will be illegal. Only reasonable steps, for example, would be necessary on overall access and, similarly, it would only be reasonable responses to the specific student that were necessary. For example, if a college had just spent a lot of money on strategic accommodation, it may not be unreasonable to refuse entry to an individual student who had high cost requirements. On the other hand, it may be unreasonable to refuse a student who did not require much accommodation. "Reasonableness" must be to do with common sense.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para13"></a>I am cheered that the Minister is creating a new Part IIIA, called "Education". It gives us the opportunity to draw up a new definition of "reasonableness" applicable to that part of the Bill and regulations, which could include a scale of additional costs. For example, one may not be required to spend more than a certain amount per student and on not more than a certain number of students per school year. That is something which should be discussed; it may vary with the size of the college, the access and so forth.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para14"></a>I turn to the Government's amendments. I welcome the new Part IIIA. To begin with, I welcome the heading because it brings education into the Bill. It is a little move towards what we wanted. Have the Government had any further thoughts on including a more positive, though perhaps still declaratory, statement in the Bill in relation to education? Amendment No. 90 on schools is extremely welcome. It will mainly help people without statements but perhaps we can take this opportunity to do something <P>


<a name="column_1982"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1982</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for those pupils with statements as well. That is perhaps a conversation for another day before the next stage. I welcome also the amendment in relation to the teacher training agency. That is something we were trying to introduce during the Education Act 1994&#151;I see the noble Lord, Lord Peston, is nodding in agreement.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para15"></a>Amendments Nos. 91 and 92, covering further and higher education, will make strategic changes, as I said. They will not provide direct protection for individual students and that is why I feel our amendments are necessary. The amendment requiring the FEFCs to make annual reports is welcome if it means that positive attention is paid to students who have previously been overlooked or seen as unimportant. The amendment requiring colleges to make clear statements about the facilities they offer is welcome because it means that students will be clear about what is on offer. However, it will not prevent colleges from saying that they do not intend to do very much. I would welcome the Minister's assurance that that is not the case.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para16"></a>The amendment requiring higher education funding councils to have regard to the needs of disabled students is welcome. It will mean that they have a duty that parallels that of the further education funding councils. Those duties have been seen as important influences by students and teachers since they were introduced. The amendment will also require universities to declare what they will offer disabled students. This amendment, like the equivalent for further education, is welcome, but again it will not guarantee that universities will necessarily improve opportunities. I should like an assurance about that from the Minister as well.
<P>

<a name="50615-22_para17"></a>I have said quite enough. The amendments are very welcome in as far as they go but they do not go quite as far as I should like. I look forward to a full discussion about how we really could contain the cost. People are worried that it will escalate. I very much hope that we can continue the discussion, perhaps outside the Chamber. If the Minister would indicate at the end of the debate whether he is willing to do that, I should be very grateful. I beg to move.

All I want to say at this moment is that I very much support her amendments. We are grateful that the Government have produced their amendments and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   I only wish to say in a very brief intervention that I very much welcome what the Government have done in going so far to try to meet the concerns that we all have. I also very much support what the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth), has said. We need both her amendments and the Government's central proposal. I hope it will be agreed that if there is a very big difference between giving people encouragement to do something and requiring them to do something that will make a big difference to what happens to students. From what I have heard it seems that the cost would not be unreasonable. I hope that that is true. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   We have moved a long way in a short time in that we can now be debating discrimination within further education against students with a severe learning disability. It therefore seems not unreasonable that, having got this far, we should want to go further.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para0"></a>The remit given to the further education funding council under the 1992 Act is to fund what I might call basic courses where such courses are specifically designed to lead on to further things. That causes difficulties in the case of someone with severe learning disabilities whose current need is to build on the incomplete basic education provided by school and who may or may not be able to move on to other things as other students are. A great deal of energy and imagination has been invested in designing basic courses which come within the terms of Schedule 2. The energy can be much better invested in concentrating on the needs of the students and the ability of the teaching staff to deliver what the students need. The unfair discrimination lies in putting in hurdles under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 which impede students with severe learning disabilities and do not impede students without severe learning disabilities. The Government's amendments do not resolve this problem because they do not override a barrier which is written in statute.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-23_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I should like to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth), on the way she has moved the amendment. The cases she has recited cause concern inside universities as well as outside. Something must be done to make sure that we do not get too many of these cases turning up in future.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para1"></a>In anything involving higher education I must declare an interest. I am concerned here particularly with government Amendment No. 91 and particularly with subsection (6) of that amendment. We are offered these amendments on the understanding that they are two competing amendments. It really rather seems to put me in the position of Paris; but I may say that in that contest the Minister is at a disadvantage for whatever his many and great virtues he is undoubtedly not a goddess.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para2"></a>There is something of a history which I am afraid that I shall have to tell the Committee in some of its detail. There is as much concern in the universities as anywhere else to try to do things to help people with disabilities. We are quite used to the idea that academic freedom is subject to the law of the land. It has been that way in cases of racial discrimination and of sexual discrimination. I have never heard any academic voice argue that it should not be so. I hope that that point is <P>


<a name="column_1984"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1984</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clear. However, what tends to cause us concern is any intervention by outside authority in matters of specific curriculum and academic content. I am not talking only of the Government. There are many things in matters relating to the curriculum that I would not alter on the demand of my own college principal unless he happened to be in my subject, and on at least one occasion I have had to tell him so and he has accepted it.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para3"></a>Universities rely heavily on Section 68(3) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, which was carried in the Lobbies on the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Beloff. It lays down that terms and conditions imposed by the Secretary of State:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may not be framed by reference to particular courses of study or programmes of research (including the contents of such courses or programmes and the manner in which they are taught, supervised or assessed) or to the criteria for the selection and appointment of academic staff and for the admission of students".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para4"></a>I hope that your Lordships understand why that is crucial. We were extremely grateful to hear it reaffirmed in pretty well the same words by Mr. Boswell speaking in another place on the 7th of this month. It therefore caused us some concern that initially the wording of the government amendment involved an amendment to Section 68(3). That has disappeared and we are extremely grateful for that, but because we do not understand, and have never understood, why it was there in the first place, we inevitably look the amendment slightly more carefully in the mouth than we would do otherwise. I think that that is understood and accepted.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para5"></a>I am extremely grateful to both Ministers, the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and through them to their officials, for a great deal of consultation over the past week which has produced a great deal of improvement. If the final stage of that consultation&#151;or what I hope is the final stage&#151;is taking place on the Floor of that Chamber, I am afraid that that is because we started a little late. On 4th April we gave a warning to Mr. Boswell that there was a problem, and serious consultation began on 5th June, after which we had three different forms of amendment within four days. No wonder we have not quite kept up with each other, although I know that we have all tried extremely hard, for which I am grateful.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para6"></a>I want to ask, with the case of Pepper v. Hart in mind, a few detailed questions about the meaning of the disability statements. First, what is meant in new subsection (4B) by,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"information of a specified description"?</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para7"></a>What is meant by "the provision of facilities"? There are two ways in which one could understand that. One could understand that it means information which is crucial to people with disabilities, such as that relating to ramps, lifts, induction loops for the deaf and the provision of braille facilities. All of those things cause no problems. If policy statements on those are wanted, that is entirely agreeable and entirely right and proper. What would concern us more would be if policy statements asked how far each individual course was suitable for disabled students because, of course, we all understand that there is no such thing as a course which is suitable for disabled students, fullstop. It depends on the nature of the course and the nature of the disability&#151;
<P>


<a name="column_1985"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   And the student.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-23_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Yes, as my noble friend Lord Addington reminds me, no doubt on the nature of the student too. But that I think is beside the purposes of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para8"></a>For example, one might be entirely happy about a deaf student working with sulphuric acid. One might not be quite so happy about a blind student doing the same. So, if what is being asked for is a list of which courses are suitable for disabled students, the vice-chancellor will have to list 100 courses, cross-referenced to 100 disabilities, and he will forget at least 100 other disabilities. Because we all know every time we go through a list of briefs on disability in every one we pick up several disabilities which we had never previously imagined; we had never heard of them. So that by itself would be a considerable body of work.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para9"></a>But when we get into the curriculum and specific courses, especially specific courses, there is a rather bigger problem. We of course understand, and we accept, the assurances given by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, writing to me on 8th June:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not the intention that the higher education amendments will have the effect of compelling institutions to make changes. Institutions will continue to decide themselves what provision they wish and are able to offer".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para10"></a>I thank him for those words. We understand them. We accept them.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para11"></a>But of course there is inevitably a pressure. What concerns me is the possibility that the pressure which does, and ought to, exist to make courses more accessible to students with specific disabilities when we can do so might blend with the pressure which is there all the time to reduce costs. For example, if one discusses field trips for geologists, it might be argued, very much in the way medieval history suffers in the politically correct climate of California, that these things should be cut out because they are not quite suited to the people to whom they are to be offered.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para12"></a>If we get into that sort of territory, that will cause inside the universities considerable anxiety. If we do not get into the territory of exhaustive paperwork or the territory of pressure on curriculum content, then, if there is any curriculum element in these disability statements, I should like to know what it is for because I do not see it.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para13"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Baroness raise different sorts of questions. If I may&#151;I have given her notice of this&#151;I should like to ask her a few questions about what is the effect of the amendments. If she cannot answer them instantly, if she says to me, like a Minister, that she will write to the noble Earl, that will be entirely acceptable to me.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para14"></a>First, there is no problem about our being subject in universities to the law of the land. When I wrote a book on academic freedom I put in a whole section arguing that that was the case. One of the reviewers asked whether I really needed to say it. It seemed that I did. Also, there is no problem about being subject to the courts, because the courts do not have an education policy. So that much is all right. But the question of costs, the noble Baroness herself said, is crucial. It is right that universities should be under pressure to spend money&#151;we are under pressure internally whatever happens externally&#151;on better facilities for the disabled.
<P>


<a name="column_1986"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para15"></a>When we talk about access, we hope that we mean access in the physical sense rather than in the wider intellectual sense. The problem is one of priorities. If I could say what I think in equity ought to be the case, I would be glad to know whether it is the effect of the Bill that it will become the case. Let us take together four possible causes for spending money. First, there is asbestos in the roof; secondly, financial hardship: one has &#163;2,000 and one might save four students from being unable to do their degree work properly. Thirdly, there is the library: 30 per cent. of students unable to complete essays because they cannot get the books; and, fourthly, a need for access by ramps to the main lecture theatre.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para16"></a>What I believe should in equity be the case is that the asbestos should come first on grounds of medical necessity and that the other three factors should count equally. Would it be the effect of coming within the Bill that those three factors would count equally and that they would have to work on the system of Buggins' turn or, by force of law, would one necessarily come above the others? If it is the first, that seems to me to be entirely reasonable and acceptable. If it is the second, that might be a little more worrying and would raise the question of who decides what is reasonable. Two of those three factors are in areas where the Department for Education tends to see no evil. So the question of who judges what is reasonable might be crucial.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para17"></a>Finally&#151;and I am sorry to have taken so much of the Committee's time&#151;I must ask the noble Baroness the same questions that I have asked the Government. Can she give an undertaking that coming within the Bill would not create any pressure to change the content of courses? There will be places where the content of courses may and should be changed in order to make the courses more accessible to disabled students. But that is a decision that must be taken by people qualified in the subject. It cannot be taken by anyone else either inside or outside the university.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para18"></a>If the noble Baroness can assure me that coming within the Bill would not threaten that principle, that would weigh very materially with me and I should feel happy with it.

<A NAME="50615-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   The Committee will be interested to hear the Government's response to the seminar. We look forward to hearing the Minister's views. I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth) on the splendid way in which she introduced the amendments. I was convinced by them and I am certain that the Minister too will be convinced. He was listening to her so carefully.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para19"></a>I wish to focus on Amendments Nos. 69 and 70, which bring education into the scope of the Bill. The importance of the amendments relates to and reflects the importance of further and higher education. It is all too easy to overlook that. Of course, education is crucial because it enables people to develop their capabilities and to obtain jobs. That is important for the person and for the economy. However, we cannot afford to waste the talents of disabled people. The theme of all the political parties is <P>


<a name="column_1987"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1987</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>training and it is especially important that disabled people, because of their physical limitations, train their minds.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para20"></a>Information technology is most significant for the future. There is little that disabled people cannot do in the field of information technology. We now have computers which can literally be controlled with the blinking of an eye. We see disabled people doing that; that is, winking at computers and having them open doors, operate typewriters and so forth. All that is incredible and it represents the kind of world into which we are moving.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para21"></a>But disabled people will require training if they are to take advantage of the great opportunities. They need specialist training in the same way as everyone else. However, despite those facts, education is omitted from the Bill. We know that discrimination is widespread in both further and higher education.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para22"></a>A few universities such as Staffordshire, in which I have declared an interest, have sparkling voluntary initiatives. Other universities such as Durham, Bristol and the Open University have special arrangements such as access schemes for deaf people. But that is patchwork provision throughout the country. Perhaps I may give one example. Deaf students are very under-represented in British universities; there are only 300 deaf students in higher education. Now that figure speaks volumes about the amount of unwitting or deliberate discrimination in British universities, because no one can convince me&#151;and I hope that the Minister cannot be convinced&#151;that all the other deaf people do not have the capacity for higher learning and are not good enough to go to university. Because of discrimination, there are only 300 deaf students in our universities. I hope that the Minister will address his mind to that.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para23"></a>The government amendments tabled by the Minister are merely inching forward at the speed of snails and are totally inadequate. We really need robust and radical change. That is not spelt out yet by the Government. We need to provide disabled people and disabled students especially with the protection of the law.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para24"></a>The universities which are concerned and considerate need appropriate funding. I know from my discussions with various officials of universities that currently they are so badly squeezed that making provision for disabled students is very difficult. No one suggests that there should be a massive investment programme overnight, and I am sure that the Minister is glad to hear that, but we are hoping for massive investment in due course and the sooner the Government can begin, the better. There is no difficulty about over-burdening the universities&#151;I am sure that someone will raise that point&#151;because colleges and universities are well protected by the "reasonable" clauses of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50615-23_para25"></a>I conclude by saying that, unless we include education in this Bill, gifted disabled students will suffer discrimination on the same monumental scale that they have been suffering for past decades. They will be denied the opportunities to which they have as much right as any other people.

<a name="column_1988"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1988</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>universities are able to offer flexibility to disabled students because those establishments have academic freedom. Many higher education establishments have proved to be extremely flexible because they have that ability. When establishments grant their own degrees they can make their own rules and, therefore, disabled students can be accommodated. The higher education sector has certainly shown a great deal of goodwill in that regard&#151;and certainly for many dyslexics. Indeed, that flexibility was shown to me. We should bear that in mind when considering these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   From these Benches, we too congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth) on her presentation of the amendments and the way in which she has probed the Government on their intentions in this area.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para0"></a>Many of the points which need to be made have been made already by previous speakers. In particular, I wish to support the points made by my noble friend Lord Ashley. It is extremely important to recognise that the first hurdle is by far the greatest hurdle for students with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para1"></a>All human beings tend to under-achieve their maximum potential. But the ability of those with severe disabilities, many of whom have been denied access to mainstream education, to achieve degree-level status in the courses which they follow once they reach university has been proven time and time again.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para2"></a>In speaking to these amendments, in particular I should like to endorse the reference made by the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth) to non-statemented special needs. That is a category of special needs which has often been overlooked and which is unprotected by the statementing procedure. Among that group of potential students there are many who are falling far short of the opportunity to achieve their full potential.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para3"></a>From these Benches, we welcome the new Part IIIA, which puts education on the face of the Bill. But we still have a deep anxiety that the fundamental civil rights of those seeking the right not to be discriminated against in the provision of education are not being addressed by the Government. It would be churlish not to recognise that the Government have moved their position. However, we shall read extremely carefully the Minister's justification for not including education in full as a service.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para4"></a>I have heard the Minister speak on several occasions about the difficulties and the costs. I can do little more than echo the words used in a previous debate by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy. He said that the whole content of the Bill deals with and stresses the fact that the justification is that reasonable action is taken and that reasonable decisions are made. The principle of the Bill, based as it is upon that concept of what is reasonable, surely cannot be denied in relation to such an important route to full participation in life as the access to education.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para5"></a>As I said, we believe that the Government have moved. We hope that they will move further. We look forward to hearing and reading in detail the Minister's response. But we may perhaps return to the matter on Report.

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1989</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Stoke. Like the noble Lord, I was distressed by his figures regarding the number of deaf students in universities. But, of course, universities can only admit those who actually apply. In disability, as in race, one always has to ask whether the winnowing process may be going on lower down. The only quantitative measure of discrimination is to take the percentage of applicants and the percentage admitted. With disability, both of those are identical within two decimal points, at 2.7 per cent. Therefore, there are many factors to blame. I do not think that it is lack of goodwill; at least, I hope that it is not. If the noble Lord can show me any case where it is, I will be happy to take the matter further in any way that I can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am sorry that the audience appears to have vanished from the Chamber. Indeed, I was rather looking forward to performing to a full Chamber for the next half hour or so. But, there we are, I shall have to make do with the season ticket holders, if I can so describe those Members of the Committee who are usually with me during the long hours on the Bill. I am delighted to see that the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, has returned to the Chamber. I was somewhat worried because I was deprived of the chance of responding to him on his previous amendments. I thought that we had, perhaps, lost him overboard. However, I am delighted to see that the noble Lord is back in his place and pushing me as hard as he can.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para6"></a>Unfortunately for the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, my attention was drawn to an interview that he gave in the BBC's, "See, Hear" programme earlier this year, when he spoke to a Canadian MP, who I believe was deaf. I suspect that the noble Lord gave the game away on that occasion. However, the noble Lord allows me to look at and listen to his speeches and they give me a slight feeling that he is trying to push me further than he expects, or even wants, me to go. The noble Lord said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I believe in demanding everything and letting Ministers try to knock you down. Then you reach something satisfactory for the people concerned".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para7"></a>Therefore, in future, when the noble Lord tries to appeal to my conscience and I knock him down, I shall not feel as guilty, because I shall realise that that is not just what he expects but that he will probably think that the position we arrive at is a reasonable one.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para8"></a>I should say first of all that I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth), for agreeing that her two amendments and mine should be in the same group. I think&#151;especially given the hour&#151;that that prevents our having two debates reasonably close together where we would have covered almost the same ground. I hope she will accept my thanks because if this had not happened I would then have had to make two long speeches. That is all right for me but the Committee might have found the sound of my voice a little wearing by the end of the evening.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para9"></a>We have considered carefully the arguments both in this Chamber and in another place, and indeed the discussions which have gone on outwith either Chamber, for including further and higher education within the scope of Part III of the Bill. I reassure the Committee that we place a high priority on widening access, but we must consider the practical effect of including further and <P>


<a name="column_1990"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1990</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>higher education in the Bill. The inclusion would at a stroke undermine the strategic role that the councils play. Each institution would have to consider adaptations without any regard to provision elsewhere. That would inevitably lead to piecemeal arrangements and a dissipation of scarce resources. It is not a result which I believe the Committee would wish to see.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para10"></a>I recognise of course the appeal of an argument which cites the difficulties experienced by some individuals under the current arrangements and suggests that were further and higher education to be included within Part III of the Bill these might be overcome at a modest cost. First, while the cost of some alterations may be modest, in aggregate they will be significant and will consume resources which might be spent to even greater effect as part of a coherent programme. Certainly, it would be a delusion to believe that resources will be available to fund both approaches. And the view that such changes may be contained in regulations, perhaps under Clause 14(4) or 15(6), is mistaken. Those regulation-making powers refer to circumstances in which a provider of services is to be taken to be justified in treating a disabled person less favourably or to circumstances in which it is not reasonable for a provider of services to have to take steps. How is one to describe such circumstances, given the diversity of curricula and practices, the range of resources available to institutions, and the current state of adaptation of buildings? The regulation-making powers reflect, rightly, a different approach and are not intended to cover the situation where the funding councils play a strategic role.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para11"></a>I know there is an argument that the threat of court action will ensure that laggard institutions will become more responsive to the needs of disabled people. If the aim is to secure access, the existing complaints procedures in FE, strengthened by the government amendments, will give the further education funding councils the power to ensure that colleges make available adequate information and the provision set out in them. The councils' planning and reporting arrangements, also strengthened by the government amendments, provide a complementary security at national level.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para12"></a>In proposing her amendments the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth), asked for reassurance about the disability statements in FE. FE colleges and the councils already demonstrate the progressive improvement in facilities. I anticipate that statements on the part of the colleges will show further improvements. I wish to emphasise to the noble Baroness that FEFC annual reports are not just retrospective, they are also prospective; in other words, they look at the plans for the future. Before I leave the amendments I should say that some of the points the noble Lord, Lord Rix, made are perhaps more relevant to Amendment No. 149 which is not to be taken today and will be discussed on 27th June. However, I shall certainly bear in mind the points he made.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para13"></a>Against the background that I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendments in the name of the noble Baroness, I wish to explain our proposals for addressing what we accept is a problem to which we should attempt to find a solution. Therefore, I should like to explain the thinking behind the government amendments and the way in which they build rationally upon existing provisions.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para14"></a>The Further and Higher Education Act 1992 set out the framework for further education for students with learning difficulties and disabilities, which I am assured is referred to as SLDD. As I remember from my sojourn in it, the world of education is littered with acronyms. The Act requires the further education funding councils to act in a strategic manner to secure sufficient and adequate provision of further education, taking due account of the needs of the population in terms of location, equipment, aptitudes and abilities. They have particular responsibilities in respect of students with learning difficulties and disabilities.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para15"></a>The FEFCE has set in place three complementary mechanisms for discharging that comprehensive legislative duty. First, it requires colleges to submit strategic plans, including analyses of local needs. Secondly, the council's funding methodology has been designed to take into account the particular needs of students with disabilities. Thirdly, the FEFCE's inspectorate includes a specialist team with specific responsibilities for reporting on the quality of provision for disabled students in FE sector colleges and also that funded by the FEFCE in the independent sector.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para16"></a>Of course, we recognise that these mechanisms are still bedding in: but the FEFCE is not complacent. It has demonstrated its responsiveness by adjustments to the recurrent funding methodology for the next academic year so that colleges will be able to claim up to &#163;8,800 per student (and more in some cases) to cover a wide range of additional costs arising from the education of students requiring extra support.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para17"></a>The council has conscientiously tried to plan for the longer term through its committee on learning difficulties and/or disabilities. That committee, chaired by Professor Tomlinson of Warwick University, has been assiduous in collecting evidence from all with an interest in education and disability issues, in seeking the views of disabled students and in trying to map the true extent of need.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para18"></a>The FEFCE's commitment to the needs of students with learning difficulties and disabilities is clear. It builds rationally on the legislation to secure the most effective use of resources which, as we all&#151;or at least some of us&#151;acknowledge, are finite. We all wish to see them used to secure real gains for students with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para19"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 91. Subsections (1) to (3) would place a duty on the funding councils to require individual colleges to produce, as a condition of grant, information on their facilities for education for students with disabilities. We envisage further consultation with the councils prior to prescribing the frequency and content of the statements in regulations. Information is likely to include physical access, the provision of specialist equipment, facilities which may help students with particular disabilities, admission policies, counselling and welfare arrangements.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para20"></a>I envisage that that amendment will highlight the good practice already in existence in many colleges in the sector and encourage other institutions to emulate it. It will also help students with disabilities to make informed choices about further education. Moreover, not only will they know what they are entitled to expect, they will also be able to seek redress from the councils on the rare occasions when provision fails to meet expectations <P>


<a name="column_1992"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1992</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>raised by the information. Where other measures fail, the councils will have the power to demand repayment of grant from colleges which fail to meet the new legislative requirements.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para21"></a>Subsection (4) of Amendment No. 91 builds upon the strategic role of the further education funding councils. This will place a duty on the councils to produce an annual report to the Secretary of State on the progress made during the year in the provision of further education for students with disabilities and the councils' plans for future provision. We envisage the FEFCE drawing on existing review and planning mechanisms as well as the new information generated by the first amendment and the work of the Tomlinson Committee.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para22"></a>My noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy asked me about the position of Scotland. Indeed, he noted that the amendments apply only to England and Wales. As regards further education in Scotland, colleges are already required by statute to submit development plans which include information on the provision made for students with learning difficulties and disabilities. This information is used by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State in preparing his annual report to Parliament. Ministers propose in future to make it a condition of grant-in-aid that information on such provisions for students on special programmes and students receiving extended learning support be included in the annual reports that colleges are required to produce.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para23"></a>Although no one asked me, I am sure that Members of the Committee will be interested in the structures and funding mechanisms for further education in Northern Ireland. It means that the changes proposed in England and Wales cannot be applied directly in Northern Ireland. Ministers will, however, consider the proposed further education amendments when detailed legislation is being prepared for the incorporation of further education colleges in Northern Ireland. The FE and HE charters for Northern Ireland, which will be published later this year, will contain a requirement for colleges to make available information on disabled access. Existing powers will permit the Secretary of State to attach conditions to the payment of grant, and it is his intention to do so. I hope that that answers my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para24"></a>In the case of higher education, subsection (5) of Amendment No. 91&#151;and its parallel in Amendment No. 92 in the case of Scotland&#151;strengthens, by putting a duty on the funding councils, the present position which is that the Secretaries of State give guidance to the funding councils that they should have regard to the needs of disabled students. In responding to that guidance, the funding councils have undertaken various initiatives which have been welcomed by the sector. Subsection (6) of Amendment No. 91 ensures that disabled persons and the funding councils have access to information about what provision is available.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para25"></a>In respect of subsections (5) and (6) of Amendment No. 91, and the points made particularly at Second Reading by my noble friend Lord Beloff, I can assure Members of the Committee that we have taken very seriously the commitment we gave to consult higher education representative bodies.
<P>


<a name="column_1993"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para26"></a>Those bodies saw no difficulty with subsection (5). However, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, explained to us, both today and at Second Reading, the ideas underlying subsection (6) caused some difficulty. It was indicated in another place that it was originally intended to give the Secretary of State an unambiguous power to require the funding councils to require disability statements. That generated much discussion.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para27"></a>In order for the originally intended power to be unambiguous, we concluded then that it would be necessary to qualify Section 68(3) of the Further and Higher Education Act. That is because Ministers are barred by that section from framing terms and conditions of grant with reference to courses, staff and admissions, and it might be held that requiring information about provision for disabled persons would fall foul of that. However, the representative bodies, supported eloquently by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, argued strongly that Section 68(3) should remain untouched. I gather that some Members of Committee have a special affection for that section, as I suspect that my colleague at the time suffered the same fate at the Dispatch Box as I suffered a little while ago. I appreciate that noble Lords are sensitive about their victories over Government when there are suggestions that the Government might make changes in their previous victories. Therefore we sought an alternative route.
<P>

<a name="50615-24_para28"></a>I am grateful to the noble Earl for expressing his thanks to my noble friend Lord Lucan.

<P>

<a name="50615-25_para0"></a>I am grateful to the noble Earl for expressing his thanks to my noble friend Lord Lucas, and the officials at the department as well as my honourable friend Tim Boswell, the Minister responsible for higher education matters at the department. We sought an alternative route and considered an amendment to Section 65 to achieve an equivalent effect through the funding councils' own powers to impose conditions of grant. We consulted further about the drafting of an amendment to Section 65, and subsection (6) of the amendment now tabled takes into account further discussions with representative bodies, as the noble Earl recognised.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para1"></a>The representative bodies have also sought clarification of the intended scope of the information in the statements. The noble Earl asked me about that. The intention is that the statements would assist disabled students and funding councils generally in understanding the provision available for education and research in the particular institution. The drafting of the amendment is designed to secure that. The statements would thus go wider than simply including information about physical facilities. It will be a matter for the funding councils, in consultation, to determine how to specify the information needed in the statements to achieve that in a viable and <P>


<a name="column_1994"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1994</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cost-effective way. I should stress that the provision of information will not ipso facto require any changes in the nature of the facilities offered by the institution.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para2"></a>I hope that the Committee will support these higher education amendments and the associated amendment relating to the teachers' training agency. They offer an alternative, flexible and preferable approach to including further and higher education within the ambit of Part III of the Bill rather than the amendments put down by the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth).
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para3"></a>Perhaps I may turn to Amendment No. 90, which I also tabled. It amends the Education Act 1993. The Government seek to build substantially on a measure which has already been widely acclaimed&#151;the requirement on all schools to make plain their policies towards pupils with special educational needs.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para4"></a>One of the major themes in the Education Act 1993 was that mainstream schools should play their full part in providing for pupils with special needs at every stage; and that a school's duties should be clarified through the code of practice for the identification and assessment of such children. That has been achieved and your Lordships have received and ratified that code. Local accountability is ensured through the requirement on schools to formulate and publish information about their policy for children with special needs, keeping parents and prospective parents informed. The publication of SEN policies will help to prevent the possibility that parents could feel inclined to send their child to a special school on the basis that they did not know enough about the SEN provision in local mainstream schools.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para5"></a>We now want to extend and strengthen that very successful initiative. In another place, the Government listened carefully to concern about the appeals arrangements for pupils with SEN. Some appeared to feel that although the 1993 Act provided a specific appeals structure for pupils with statements it did not provide a similar safety net for those pupils without statements. I should like to make it absolutely clear at this point that the 1993 Act contains significant measures for pupils without statements. Only about 2 per cent. of children require statements of special educational need, though about 20 per cent. of children have SEN at some time. The code of practice covers all pupils with SEN, not just those with statements.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para6"></a>However, we have looked closely at the appeals mechanism for pupils without statements and are satisfied that we can improve the situation for those pupils and their parents through the amendment. We aim to place a duty on the face of the Bill for governors to publish information about, first, the arrangements for the admission of disabled pupils; secondly, the steps taken to prevent disabled pupils from being treated less favourably than other pupils in the school; and, thirdly, the facilities provided by the school to assist access for disabled pupils.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para7"></a>While we stand firm in maintaining the exclusion of education and protecting the recent legislation, we recognise the strength of feeling displayed during debates which has called for an acknowledgment that unjustifiable discrimination cannot be condoned in schools. That is why we have taken the step of making this amendment in primary legislation.
<P>


<a name="column_1995"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1995</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para8"></a>Schools which are inaccessible to disabled pupils will have to admit it. The need to do so will be a spur for them to consider how they might become accessible cost effectively. We have already advised them that they may be able to do that, perhaps through flexibility in their own budgets or, if they are grant-maintained schools, by direct application for capital grant to the funding authority. Now, of course, the new schools access initiative will be able to make improvements and assist the general accessibility of all schools. The Government published a consultation paper on the initiative on 29th March and propose to make &#163;10 million available in 1996-97 to fund imaginative and cost-effective projects to increase both physical and curriculum access to mainstream schools. It will be invaluable in helping to consolidate our recent measures in special education, including the code of practice.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para9"></a>Amendment No. 90 will also provide practical strengthening of parents' rights. Once a school has specified under this formulation the arrangements it has in place to avoid discrimination against disabled pupils a dissatisfied parent could make the school's non-compliance with its stated policy a central issue under the existing appeals arrangements whose autonomy and independence is ensured by the recent codes of practice and the addition of a lay member.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para10"></a>Amendment No. 90 will also specifically require schools to set out their policies of non-discrimination against pupils with disabilities. Schools should not merely pay lip service to the integration of disabled pupils; rather they should do everything they can to achieve genuine and full integration. I am convinced that this measure will encourage such integration, underpinned by the statutory duty to integrate pupils within mainstream schools as far as is possible.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para11"></a>The Committee will, I am sure, see that these are very significant measures which, without creating large burdens on schools and authorities, will do a great deal to focus creative thinking in our schools, promote a better deal for many disabled children and accelerate further the trend to greater integration in mainstream schools.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para12"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 150 is simply to make the entry for the repeals schedule which is needed as a result of Amendment No. 90.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para13"></a>I apologise for having spoken at some length but as these are important new clauses the Committee would rightly expect me to explain them in some detail. Also, of course, it will enable Members of the Committee to read in Hansard exactly what I said, thereby allaying, I hope, any fears. I trust that the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth), will accept that while I am not going for what I described to her as the "belt and braces" solution&#151;I am not sure whether mine is the belt or the braces&#151;I very much hope that, whichever it is, the solution is sensible and realistic in all the circumstances. I hope that she will withdraw her amendment. If perchance&#151;who knows?&#151;it is put to the vote, I hope that my noble friends will support me against it and that subsequently they will support me when I put my amendments to the Committee. I am pretty certain, however, that my amendments will be widely and warmly welcomed by the Committee, and I commend them.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I wish to press the Minister on one aspect of his comments on his Amendment No. 90. I seek an explanation, if not tonight then at some other time, as to why, unlike all other parts of capital funding of school building projects, it is proposed in the draft setting out for consultation the expenditure of &#163;10 million capital grant for 1996-97 that matching funding should be sought from a non-statutory source. It strikes one as unfair that funding for building needs should be met only in those schools that are able to raise funds from voluntary contributions or voluntary organisations. That does not seem equitable.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para14"></a>On access and the whole issue of higher and further education, I ask the Minister to consider, within presumably the coherent programme the Government seek, as opposed to what the Minister described as the piecemeal approach&#151;I understood, though perhaps I got it wrong, that he was talking about a coherent programme&#151;perhaps developing different facilities at different universities to allow student choice. That is fine for students who are able to leave home and students who are of standard entry age. However, an increasing percentage of students are mature students or students who have physical problems which do not allow them to leave home. Therefore it is important that all higher education institutions are adapted as quickly as possible to take the widest range.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para15"></a>Also, our universities and colleges are an access point for many local employers. Again, it is critically important because employers will not send people to go on short training as readily as they will send them to the local facility.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para16"></a>Finally, perhaps I may ask the Government to consider the fact that, by treating this area of capital funding separately from credit approvals in the normal education budget allocations that are made at budget time, they are still ducking the issue of the local priority that is given to credit approval expenditure. Current government levels for education building spending only allow basic need in the overwhelming majority of cases, and basic need is the highest priority.
<P>

<a name="50615-25_para17"></a>But surely the situation is that for each student or pupil who is denied access it is 100 per cent. denial of access for that individual. We are not dealing with a marginal effect. For those students and pupils, the resources ought to be as available as though there were no place available for them physically within the school, because literally that is the position. Therefore, the roof over their head must include the ramp to the door as being equal and not inferior in terms of government priorities when allocating funds for school building.

I hope that I shall not be taken to be ungracious if I press him just a little further. There are questions to which I would very much like the answers but I have not yet heard them.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para0"></a>First, I should like to know what is meant by the word "facilities" referred to in Amendment No. 91 (new Section (6)). Could the Minister answer that with the case of Pepper v. Hart in mind? We have no argument about physical provisions for access. That has been clear <P>


<a name="column_1997"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 1997</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>throughout the debate. But the Minister said that the Government want further information beyond that. The heart of my concern throughout has been that I have wanted to know what further information the Government want beyond that point. That is the crucial question for determining whether this will involve any intrusion&#151;or indeed serious intrusion&#151;into areas of academic judgment.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para1"></a>I must confess that I simply did not understand what the Minister said on that point. He said that the Government wanted information on physical facilities and on provision for education and research for disabled people. I believe that those were his exact words. But I cannot work out what those words mean. In putting on a course, one does not provide facilities for disabled people "full stop". One may be able to provide facilities for one kind of disabled people in one course and for another kind of disabled people in another course. One needs to know the specific course and the specific disability. Is the Minister in fact asking us to match course to disability across the field of every single course taught in every university? If he is saying that, does he realise what a burden of work he is setting for us? If he is asking something else, I should like to know what and I should like to know why.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para2"></a>I should also like to know what the word "research" is doing in the amendment. In my subject, the university does not provide facilities for research. The facilities for research are the British Library, the Public Record Office and the County Record Office, all provided by other authorities. Therefore one cannot require universities to provide facilities for research, least of all before one knows what research is wanted. I do not understand what the word "research" is doing in the amendment. I am sure that the Minister could put my fears to rest very quickly if he could make clear what he wants. If he can do that, there will be a great effort on our part, if we can, to give him what he wants. But we need to know what it is first.

<A NAME="50615-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   It may be helpful for me to respond to the two interventions asking about some of the detail on the points I made. I can begin with the noble Earl, Lord Russell. Being reminded by the noble Earl about the case of Pepper v. Hart, I shall be a little cautious. I shall certainly make sure that I read the exchange we have had. If there is anything I feel I can add, I shall write to him and I have no doubt that the noble Earl will approach me if he thinks there is anything, on reflection, that is not quite right.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para3"></a>I may be repeating myself, but it is the best I can do. The intention is that the statement would assist disabled students and funding councils generally to understand the provision available for education and research in a specific institution. I imagine&#151;I will check that I am right about this&#151;that if a student is looking for a Ph.D course or postgraduate degree, he will need to research where it is available. That is the research we are talking about. It relates to the availability of a course in a university to a disabled student.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para4"></a>In relation to the statement, I was asked about my remark that it would go wider than simply including information in relation to physical facilities. I said very clearly that it would be a matter for funding councils in consultation with the universities to decide together what facilities they are referring to. It will not be up to the Government. We are asking the funding councils to do that and are not expecting to do it ourselves. I am advised that the education research I quoted&#151;perhaps I was wrong in my definition of it&#151;comes from the existing Act. I shall check on that and write to the noble Earl if he does not mind.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para5"></a>Turning to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, we want the &#163;10 million to buy as much as possible. The schools access initiative proposes that schools should harness community involvement, in part through funding, but also through co-operation in partnership. However, the consultation paper makes clear that additional funding is not essential. I hope that that helps the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para6"></a>I hope that we will have a coherent programme; that is the object of my amendment. While at some point in the future it may be possible to reach the position where every course is available in every institution of higher education, the reality is that it will take some time to reach that situation. While I appreciate that some students are a long way from any university, the increased number of universities throughout the country&#151;thanks to the policies of this Government&#151;means that there will be a number of universities within easy reach of the great majority of potential students. That does not mean all of them, but the chances are that, if they have to leave home to go to university, then they will have the full range of universities to look at to find the one that most suits them from the point of view of their disability, the courses provided, and so forth.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para7"></a>With the increasing number of universities we have around, I do not actually think that that will be a huge problem, although I appreciate that it could be a difficult problem in certain instances. But I think we have to, dare I say, walk before we can run. I am not sure whether the noble Baroness was inviting me to contemplate that whatever is demanded will be paid for. The reality of government is that that commitment can never be given. I very much hope that the higher education council, the FEFC, the schools and the &#163;10 million will be able to progress this matter&#151;we all want to see it progressed&#151;as quickly as they possibly can, using the resources, which are always tight, in the most efficient manner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-26_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I must press the Minister slightly further on this. If the Government's assumption is that this category of need is different in kind from others so that this one ought to attract community involvement, it really is unjustifiable and actually makes the case for this being a right that is included among the services rather than tacked on to the end. I was certainly not suggesting that the Government should meet all need in all ways. But it is the case that the Government accept that there is a statutory requirement to provide a roof over every child's head in order that they can have education. It must be the case, therefore, that if education were included as of right to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>be free from discrimination on grounds of disability the Government would have to accept that a large start could be made for little in excess of &#163;10 million. Surely that is not too much to ask for a basic civil right for people with disabilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-26_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I must confess to being extremely disappointed by the Minister's answer on the word "facilities". I entirely take his point that what information is asked for will be decided by the funding council. But he is here conferring vires on the funding council. He is giving it power to do something. When one creates a power one must understand what the scope of that power is so that one can say what is within it and what is beyond it. If the Minister is really telling me that he is creating vires without understanding their meaning, when we meet again on Monday I shall be questioning the vires he creates in that Bill with a great deal more care than I intended to do yesterday.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I shall try again. The word "facilities" was prefaced by the word "physical". Perhaps I missed out the word "physical" in my second attempt to help the noble Earl but in my first attempt to help him I hope I said "physical facilities". On the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, I am not entirely sure where she is coming to me from. If we are talking about the &#163;10 million, perhaps I may say to her that I shall reflect on what she said and bring the matter to the attention of my colleagues at the Department for Education and ask them to write to her. It would be foolish if we made any suggestion to the outside world that somehow we can have unlimited resources. I am afraid we cannot. If the noble Baroness talks to her honourable friend Gordon Brown he will tell her that that is now the name of the new Labour Party.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-26_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I must come back on one point. If it is reasonable to provide a legal requirement on employers in the private sector, it might possibly be a case of what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander&#151;for the Government to accept their own liability when it comes to the provision of resources for education.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-26_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I trust that I shall not be misunderstood if I thank the Minister warmly for getting "physical".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-26_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Darcy (de Knayth): </B>   I thank all noble Lords for contributing to this useful debate and for having given such serious consideration to my amendments. I am grateful for the strong support that I have received from all sides of the House. Although that support was particularly strong from some sides, I shall not single out any particular noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para8"></a>However, as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, gave me a priority shopping list, perhaps I may briefly answer a few of his points. He gave the examples of asbestos, financial hardship, the library and ramps. I agree absolutely that asbestos would probably be the most important. The noble Earl said that he would be happy if the other three were regarded as equal. I might be a little harder and say that the library might be more important. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, is disapproving because of the answer that I gave the other <P>


<a name="column_2000"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2000</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>day about reasonable accommodation in the Chamber. If a library was in jeopardy, I would deal with that before turning to ramps. We must remember that disabled students are students and need to read, to eat, and to have lodgings.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para9"></a>Who decides what is "reasonable"? We shall have to work out the answer to that. The noble Earl asked for an undertaking that nothing in the Bill would pressurise a university to change the content of a course. I should think that such a decision would be entirely for the university. However, it might be legitimate to ask a university to ask itself whether there was another way of arriving at the same course with the same content and of the same standard. We could ask universities to think about that.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para10"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Park, for whose support I am extremely grateful, said that what I was asking for did not seem too expensive. She hoped that it would not be too expensive. There are about 50,000 disabled students in higher education at the moment, with about 100,000 in further education. Those figures are guesses which may be on the high side, but we have made great progress and much has been done. We cannot predict demand, but my point is that we can contain the cost. We must do that.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para11"></a>The Minister will not be at all surprised that I found his reply disappointing, although I am grateful for the time that he spent on it. He said that, at a stroke, the amendments would undermine the strategic role. That is not the case. The Minister said that he was not sure whether he had applied the belt, the braces or both. I ask him to look to his buttons, seams and pockets.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para12"></a>The Minister was rather disparaging when I said that we could do this by regulations and by a definition of "reasonableness". He wondered whether that could be done in Clauses 13 and 14 in relation to goods and services. My point is that the Minister has created Part IIIA (on education), which gives us a whole new set of regulations and definitions. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, said that there has never been any trouble with the Sex Discrimination Act or the Race Relations Act in that regard. That is true. Both the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality say that the educational provisions are much more tightly drawn than others and that there has not been any trouble. I suggest that the fact that the Minister has created provisions on education now presents us with an opportunity.
<P>

<a name="50615-26_para13"></a>The Minister has not given me anything like an open door, but I ask him whether he will not open the door a chink. I know that I said that this was a probing amendment, but perhaps it could be regarded as a prodding or a nudging amendment. Can we have a little open chink of door so that we can continue this discussion seriously outwith the Committee?

<A NAME="50615-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monkswell </B>   moved Amendment No. 71:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
After Clause 12, insert the following new clause:
<center><b>("Access to polling station</B></center><br>
.&#151;(1) In exercise of his functions under paragraph 25 of Schedule 1 to the principal Act, the returning officer shall have particular regard to the accessibility of polling stations to disabled persons.
<br>
(2) The returning officer shall carry out an annual accessibility audit of each polling station, and shall consult thereon such organisations as appear to him to be representative of disabled persons in his area.
<br>
(3) Following the audit pursuant to subsection (2) above, the returning officer shall designate such polling stations as appear to him suitable for use by disabled persons and shall publish, in at least two newspapers circulating widely in the constituency, a local radio station and otherwise as he considers fit, a list of his designations.
<br>
(4) A polling station shall not be so designated unless the returning officer intends to provide at least one wheelchair-accessible polling booth, with a ballot box being placed at a height that a person in a wheelchair can reach unaided; and it shall be the duty of the returning officer to make such provision at each designated polling station.
<br>
(5) The returning officer shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that&#151;
<br>
(a) at least half of the polling stations for which he is responsible shall be so designated within two years of the passing of this Act; and
<br>
(b) all polling stations shall be so designated within five years of the passing of this Act.
<br>
(6) Details of the designated status (or otherwise) of a polling station shall be provided by the returning officer on all official poll cards.
<br>
(7) The Secretary of State shall by regulations require each returning officer annually to report to him the results of the review of polling districts and the suitability of access for disabled persons to polling stations made pursuant to subsection (2) above, and shall lay before Parliament a summary report of all such reviews.
<br>
(8) The Secretary of State shall by regulations provide for returning officers to provide equipment to facilitate access by disabled persons to designated polling stations, but no equipment shall be provided under this subsection which requires any permanent modification to the structure or fittings of the polling station without the consent of the owner or any lessee of the building.
<br>
(9) Any costs incurred under subsection (1) above shall constitute expenses incurred by a returning officer for the purposes of section 29 of the principal Act.
<br>
(10) A registered disabled person may apply to the returning officer to vote at a designated polling station not less than one week before the election and, on receipt of such an application, the returning officer shall allot that person to the nearest designated polling station in that constituency to the address at which that person is registered.

"registration officer" and "returning officer" have the same meanings as in the principal Act;

"accessibility audit" means an assessment of the practicability and convenience of access and use, with particular emphasis on access and use by those who have physical or mental disabilities;
<br>
"the principal Act" means the Representation of the People Act 1983.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-27_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I apologise to the Committee and to the Minister for not being in my place when Amendment No. 63A was scheduled to take place. One of the glories of the Chamber is that we cannot predetermine the time when matters come up. That inevitably leads to some minor disasters on all sides.
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para4"></a>This is very much a probing amendment to try to ascertain the Government's views on the subject. The amendment would ensure that polling stations were made accessible to disabled people. It would require access audits to be carried out and the designation of those polling stations which are fully accessible, and to publicise the fact. It would also ensure that a phase-in for full accessibility was planned: half to be accessible within two years and all to be accessible within five years.
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para5"></a>The right to vote is a fundamental expression of citizenship within a democracy. The act of voting is among the most potent expressions of the right to self-determination and freedom to choose that an individual has. However, in a country that prides itself on its democratic system, many disabled people are excluded from the democratic process, primarily because of the inaccessibility of polling stations.
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para6"></a>Physical and other access problems are widespread. That has been highlighted by the findings of Polls Apart, which was a survey of access to polling stations conducted during the l992 general election by the Spastics Society. The Spastics Society is now called Scope. Most polling stations are situated in public buildings such as schools, community centres and public halls. Yet the overwhelming majority proved to be inaccessible to people with mobility difficulties.
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para7"></a>Disabled people have the right to vote, but the Bill does not help to make that right a practical reality. Polling stations are supposed to be sited, where practicable, in accessible venues; yet only 12 per cent. of polling stations were fully accessible at the last general election. Furthermore, the provisions in Part III to ensure access would not necessarily apply, because Clause 15(2) provides that adjustments have to be made or service providers can:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"provide a reasonable alternative method of making the service in question available to disabled persons".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para8"></a>The Government will argue that there is an alternative to voting in person which overcomes the problems of lack of access, and that is the postal or proxy vote. However, disabled people do not view postal or proxy votes as a reasonable alternative. Disabled people feel that it is important to vote in person, and that elections are an opportunity to participate in an important public activity. They want to cast their votes at the polling station and experience the excitement and sense of commitment that that involves.
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para9"></a>Disabled people do not like the impersonal aspect of postal or proxy votes and, most important, believe that it represents yet another way in which disabled people are excluded from the mainstream of political life.
<P>


<a name="column_2003"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2003</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para10"></a>The Government provide grants towards the cost of temporary ramps to be used at parliamentary and European parliamentary elections, but not local elections. Grants are not available towards the cost of permanent ramps. It seems shortsighted to encourage the provision of temporary ramps when permanent ramps work out cheaper in the long run. There would, for example, be no storage problems between elections, and it would further our goal of providing an environment which is accessible to disabled people.
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para11"></a>In the White Paper the Government stressed that the elimination of discrimination against disabled people cannot be realised overnight. Disabled people recognise that they must move forward with a realistic timetable and practical measures to tackle discrimination. The amendment accepts that approach. I recognise that not all polling stations can be made accessible overnight, and for that reason there is a phase-in of designated polling stations. That should be viewed as a temporary measure. The aim is to ensure full accessibility where disabled people can vote at the local polling station alongside everyone else.
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para12"></a>The first step is to establish the number of polling stations which are accessible. That audit should be done in conjunction with disability organisations, which will be able to give practical advice about the problems which disabled people face. On the basis of that audit, the returning officer will be better placed to remedy the access problems.
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para13"></a>Disabled access to polling stations would also prevent discrimination against disabled candidates for election. Having been a candidate, as have a number of Members of the Committee, I know that it is important to be able to go into the polling station, talk to the polling clerks, find out whether they have any problems and try to ensure that they are solved. It also reassures one's supporters that the election is being conducted fairly and everything is open and above board. Both disabled candidates and disabled electors would be helped by the measure.
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para14"></a>Perhaps I may give an example of how the physical situation of the polling station can have a significant effect. I was a candidate in a local council ward in Manchester. After my election I noticed that at one of the polling stations the turnout was significantly less than expected. Although the polling station was situated in the middle of the area, it was on the fringe of the residential area. On the other side of that area was a Tesco's superstore and no one was living there. For some people living on the estate, voting entailed a significant walk down a difficult, dark track. Obviously that put people off going to the polling station to vote.
<P>

<a name="50615-27_para15"></a>Following my intervention at the town hall, a polling station was sited in the middle of the estate rather than on the edge. The result was that in the subsequent election the turnout increased dramatically. I am not sure what effect that had on the result but I know that it enabled more people to contribute and be part of the electoral process. We should welcome the idea that more people can take part in the process and, on that basis, I beg to move.

<A NAME="50615-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   I understand that this is a probing amendment and that its purpose and results would be helpful on the days of parliamentary and local elections, which occur about once every two years. But I must say at the outset that I disagree with the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para0"></a>As a disabled person who was a Member of Parliament, I consider that postal voting is the answer for disabled people. My experience is that it has been extremely satisfactory. It also caters&#151;I hope that there is not going to be laughter about a very serious subject.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me. The joke, or the line, which immediately crossed our minds was the way in which the votes had been cast for the noble Lord and the governments who have followed. It was in no sense a reflection on the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   I do not follow what the noble Baroness says, but I shall expand on the matter. Of course, it was more than 21 years ago that I was in the other place but my experience goes back 50 years. I was just saying that postal voting caters for the very severely disabled&#151;those who cannot even use wheelchairs or be carried into a polling station. I am particularly concerned about those who are paralysed or completely incapacitated.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para1"></a>Postal voting brings the polling booth into your home. You really cannot do better than that. I can speak from personal experience because, as I said, I have been disabled for the past 50 years. That has been to different degrees. For the early part I was in a wheelchair; later, I graduated to crutches and then sticks. I had to go back to a wheelchair at times. Therefore, I have experienced the different forms of locomotion. I have always used postal voting.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para2"></a>I am glad to say that during the four years when I was Secretary of State for Scotland I was encouraging all the disabled people north of the Border to use postal voting as their way of voting in elections. Certainly, my constituents were glad of the advice I gave them because they knew perfectly well that I was disabled.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para3"></a>The important factor is whether the system of postal voting is working efficiently. In its early years&#151;I am talking about the late 1940s and the 1950s&#151;it did not work well but it should now be a very good system. I recommend it to disabled people.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para4"></a>The principle of goods and services is that if it is difficult or impossible for a disabled person to go to the normal place where they are provided they should be delivered to his dwelling. That happens now in the United States under the American legislation. That is what happens with postal voting. The voting procedure can be followed in the disabled person's own home.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para5"></a>In general, I urge other disabled person to concentrate on the real and implacable ways in which they are disadvantaged. I advise them not to give much time to areas where there is an adequate alternative. In this regard, there is an adequate alternative.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para6"></a>While I speak for myself, I believe that I speak also for other disabled people when I say that we have to plan in advance our daily lives. I have to do that every single day. For example, we must think about what we <P>


<a name="column_2005"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2005</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are expected to do; what we can do; and whether there will be help to put on our appliances and shoes and socks when dressing, or whether we shall need to bring with us the special devices we have for doing those things. The programme for the whole day or week must be examined. Because I am especially concerned about severely disabled people, I hope that we shall concentrate on areas where adequate alternatives do not already exist. There are a great many other fields in which we should be trying to help disabled people because there are not alternatives. But, certainly in my experience, the voting system provides an adequate alternative which, despite laughter from the Opposition Front Bench, has proved extremely satisfactory.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para7"></a>I accept that this is a probing amendment and that the noble Lord moved it in order to obtain a response. I have made my response absolutely clear; there will be no doubt about that. But the amendment might send&#151;fortunately, I do not believe that it will do so at this late hour of night&#151;the wrong message to disabled people and give them the impression that postal voting is not a satisfactory alternative. I would absolutely deplore that because in recent years it has been the basis of enabling people to vote who are extremely disabled; for example, those who could not get through the door of a polling station even if there were a ramp. It also helps others because I have not found a single disabled person who has been refused a postal vote. The system covers a whole range of disabilities. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the subject will not be pursued because there are many other matters of far more importance to disabled people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-28_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I support everything said by my noble friend. However, the point should also be made that voting has been made even easier for disabled people by virtue of the introduction of the continual or running proxy postal vote. It means that, at every election, you do not have to go back and request a postal vote thus going through the palaver of getting forms. Such forms automatically come to you through the post.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para8"></a>If my noble friend the Minister has any influence, will he please try to make that service more well known? For six years I have had to organise postal votes for my husband who is very seriously disabled. It was only during the last council election that someone tipped me off that there was such a running vote, provided that you get signed confirmation from your doctor. It is joy indeed; from now on I shall not have to do any more of that. I shall just have to make sure that the vote is sent off in the post. It is not something that is well known, but I believe that it should be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-28_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Darcy (de Knayth): </B>   I entirely understand what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, is saying; namely, that for those people who cannot get out of their homes, or for whom transport is so difficult that they have to rely on other people, the postal vote is very valuable. However, I prefer voting in person. Last year I went to a nearby primary school. It was inaccessible because it had railings and there was a step into the school. There was a form in that respect and we filled it in. In fact, <P>


<a name="column_2006"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2006</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they were delighted. I am ashamed to admit that I did not get back to vote this time, so I have not checked on the situation. But I shall do so.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para9"></a>Very often, voting does take place in schools; indeed, it is quite a good idea to install a permanent ramp in such buildings. Again, it is reasonable accommodation. Some places may just need a wooden, temporary ramp which can be removed but which will serve its purpose at times&#151;and not just for voting&#151;when people seek to use those facilities. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   As we have just dealt with an education amendment I thought for a moment or two that, if we had still been at school, I might have given the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, 100 lines for being late when the amendment was called in its proper position. I would have told him that he could not have the "sweeties" of my words of wisdom having come late to the sport. Of course, I am well aware of why he was late&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I should just like to point out that the amendment has been called in its proper position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I believe that it was grouped with a previous amendment, which, for some mysterious reason&#151;which I shall probably be up all night trying to work out&#151;was withdrawn. So we are back to dealing with it.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para10"></a>The noble Lord's proposal is for things like an annual accessibility audit, reports to the Secretary of State, newspapers and radio adverts; and, indeed, the provision of wheelchair-accessible polling booths in every polling station, no matter how remote a possibility it might be that a wheelchair user would want the use of such facilities. The noble Lord is really asking us to take steps which are both unreasonable and unnecessary. His requirements overlook the fact that local authorities are already under a statutory duty under the Representation of the People Act 1983 to keep polling places under regular review. One of the factors that they must consider is the question of accessibility for disabled people.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para11"></a>I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth) mentioned schools. Of course, polling stations are not the buildings themselves; indeed, they can be an area within the building where voting takes place. For example, a school may be designated as a polling place but the polling station may be a classroom within the school. The Spastic Society's report entitled, Polls Apart, provided an extremely valuable and critical survey of the problems faced by many disabled voters at the 1992 election. Following that report, the Home Office held a number of meetings with the Spastic Society (now Scope) and provided revised guidance to returning officers on the particular needs of disabled electors and on how to reduce the problems that they face when voting. The success of that revised guidance is apparent in the increased take-up of grants towards the purchase of temporary ramps.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para12"></a>The requirements of the new clause apparently ignore the statutory responsibility already placed on councils to keep under review the designation of polling places and the advice given to returning officers as to accessibility factors to be taken into account. Those factors are <P>


<a name="column_2007"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2007</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>detailed and were drawn up in association with Scope. It is surely right that the review is carried out at local authority level and reported to the local council. It is at local level that people are best placed to consider how provisions for disabled people can most effectively be made and how discussions with interested groups can best inform that process. I can only reiterate what my noble friend Lady Blatch said in a recent debate on electoral registration initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, when she said that the Government take very seriously their responsibility towards disabled voters. We will continue to support councils and local administrators with the necessary funds, advice and guidance to meet the needs of disabled voters.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para13"></a>I do not believe that the new clause is in the least necessary. I want to underline the point made by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy about the importance of postal votes. Disabled people, of course, have the right to vote and that right to vote is now accommodated via the postal vote which is an extremely useful means of getting people the vote. The idea that people are deprived of the vote because they cannot get to the polling station is, frankly, cloud cuckoo land. I certainly hope that that is not the message that goes out from this Chamber. We want to encourage people who are unable to attend a polling station on the day of a vote for any reason to vote by post and to apply for that.
<P>

<a name="50615-28_para14"></a>I have a postal vote for those elections I am allowed to vote in because I am here and not in Glasgow. I never feel I have been deprived of my vote just because I vote for the candidate of my choice a day or two before polling day. I also have never found any difficulty in deciding who I should vote for a day or two before polling day. Having been given the opportunity to make this commercial, I am happy to say that I was among perhaps a small band of Conservative voters at the previous local government election who voted for a candidate who won a seat on the new Glasgow unitary authority.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Of course I cherish it, and I look forward to retaining my excellent councillor for many years to come. Therefore I have no great difficulty about postal votes. I think they are a good thing. They are the way for some people to vote. I underline what my noble friend Lady O'Cathain said about what I think she described as rolling postal votes. I shall certainly bring to the attention of our noble friend Lady Blatch the points she made about the need to make the availability of that service more widely known. For all these reasons I do not believe that this is a sensible amendment. I hope the noble Lord will withdraw it. Just in case he is tempted to have another little walk down the Lobbies, I trust my noble friends will support me.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Take 100 lines!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   I can appreciate the comment about 100 lines. There was many an occasion at school when I had to take 100 lines, but it did not seem to change my response to things. That may say something about the Government's views on crime and punishment. I thank those Members of the Committee who have contributed to the discussion. I wish to make a few comments in response. First, I accept entirely the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy. Postal and proxy votes are essential for those people who cannot get out of their own homes. As the Minister said, the extension of postal voting to a wider circle enables people who are away from home on business or holiday also to have a postal vote.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para1"></a>I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, that he found them entirely satisfactory&#151;no doubt having won elections on the basis that a majority of his electors saw fit to vote for him and he has ensured that he has a vote that is reasonable. But we need also to be aware of the wider generality of the problems of disabled people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I would not wish him to misunderstand me. I did not say that the result was satisfactory. When I was Secretary of State for Scotland I did for disabled people what it has just been suggested the Home Office might do more of in England and Wales. Over 21 years ago there were four years in which I was able to ensure that almost all disabled people in Scotland knew that they could have a postal vote and could get a continuing one. I did not mind which way they voted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   I shall believe the noble Lord, even though few Members of the Committee on this side of the House believe him.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para2"></a>The case that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, raised obviously has our sympathy. I was also very glad to hear the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth), and I thank her for them.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para3"></a>Turning to the Minister's response, I was flabbergasted when he seemed to suggest that it was not necessary for service providers to make provision for the prevention of discrimination against disabled people unless they knew that such provision was needed. If one extended that philosophy right through the Bill there could be a very powerful argument for nothing to be done at all, because every service provider could turn round and say that they did not expect a disabled person to turn up and ask for a particular service. It is a very thin argument.

<P>

<a name="50615-29_para4"></a>The Minister has identified, quite correctly, that it is down to local authorities to make provision for the electoral system within their areas. He said that the Government make funds available. The Government do not make funds available to provide disabled access to polling stations. They provide some funds to enable temporary provision to be made, but not all access can be resolved by temporary provision. As I said in my opening remarks, it is not necessarily cost-effective to do that on a temporary basis. The Government have a responsibility nationwide to ensure that everyone has the best facilities possible to enable them to vote.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para5"></a>I am sorry that the Government have not seen fit even to reconsider their attitude to this issue. This is a probing amendment. We have heard the Government's response. No doubt all Members of the Committee will read the response in Hansard. In the meantime, while assuring the Minister that we may need to return to the matter, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-29_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: I move Amendment No. 73 in the hope that the Minister will give the assurances that we seek.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para11"></a>The Bill as drafted allows service providers to charge disabled people more for any goods or services adopted or adapted for their use. That could mean that a disabled person who is blind could be charged for alternative formats such as braille regarding railcards and so on. Those who are deaf could be charged for a signer. I understand that the Government assure voluntary organisations that that should not happen, that the clause covers only exceptional circumstances such as special clothing, special shoes and so on.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para12"></a>We are worried by the provision. We all accept that an impairment becomes disabling largely because of the physical and social circumstances in which people find themselves. We fear that some of the costs of overcoming the limitations of their physical and social environment may be offloaded on to disabled people.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para13"></a>We do not expect the amendment to be costly. We believe that it has major symbolic value. The provision states basically that disabled people are not a burden but full citizens with full rights, including the right to have access to services, just as their fellow citizens do. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-29_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I support the amendment. I believe that if the subsection were not in the Bill and the noble Baroness moved an amendment to put it into the Bill, my noble friend on the Front Bench would be likely to describe it as a wrecking amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-29_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful for the opportunity to clear up any misapprehensions about the purpose underlying this subsection. Clause 14(3) (d), which the amendment seeks to remove, is required to protect those businesses which provide special or adapted items for disabled people from accusations of unlawful discrimination where they charge more than they would charge another member of the public for a standard item. An example would be a tailor who has been asked by a disabled person to make a suit of an unusual pattern or using an unusual fabric. Such a task might take longer and require a special order for equipment and materials. It is reasonable that he should be able to charge more, just as he would charge more to any other person who wanted a special item made.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para14"></a>I have listened to the arguments put forward by Members of the Committee. My honourable friend the Minister of State gave a commitment that this subsection would not give businesses the opportunity to load opportunity costs on to a disabled person or allow service providers to charge more to a disabled person where they have to make their services more accessible to suit his or her disability.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para15"></a>In pursuance of this commitment, we have checked the drafting of this subsection very carefully. On the first of those concerns we are content that it would be unlikely to operate to allow a service provider to pass on to a disabled customer a potential loss of profit. However, we are less content that the present wording of Clause 14(3) (d) would prevent a service provider from passing on to a disabled person an amount equivalent to the expenditure he has occurred in making his service accessible to him in accordance with a duty imposed by the Act. It is certainly not our intention that, for example, a large organisation which had to produce information in an alternative format for some of its disabled customers should be able to charge them more for it.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para16"></a>Consequently, for the sake of clarity we shall be bringing forward an amendment at Report stage which will confirm that any increase in the cost of providing a service to a disabled person which results from compliance by a provider of services with a duty imposed on him by Section 15 shall be disregarded for the purposes of this subsection.
<P>

<a name="50615-29_para17"></a>I hope that that allays the concern expressed by the noble Baroness and by my noble friend. I hope, too, that I have explained why it is important that the provision should not be lost from the Bill. I hope that that reassures the noble Baroness and that she will be able to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </B>   moved Amendment No. 74:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 11, line 20, at beginning insert ("Subject to subsection (4A),").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-30_para1"></a>I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 74 and 75 together. The amendments concern the insurance industry. Clause 14 defines the circumstances in which the provider of services is justified in treating disabled people less favourably. Subsection (4) includes a recommendation making power to allow the Secretary of State to specify the circumstances other than those on the face of the Bill where such treatment would be justified. The subsection makes specific mention of providers of insurance services as being likely to need such regulations.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para2"></a>The amendments seek to limit the scope of the regulations as they might apply to providers of insurance in one specific sense. That is that any special circumstances in which less favourable treatment in the provision of insurance services is allowed under the Act should be justifiable on objective actuarial or other criteria. To put it more bluntly, the amendment seeks to ensure that no regulations are made which simply exempt insurers entirely from the provisions of the Act.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para3"></a>Why is that necessary? I am afraid that the insurance industry's record, although improving, is not good on dealing with those who are disabled, particularly through HIV or AIDS. Before my noble friend tells me that the Bill is not concerned with the rights of those with HIV but with the disabled, I hasten to remind him that HIV leads to AIDS. In the past, in order to try to identify at an early stage anyone who might be at risk of becoming an AIDS case, the industry would almost certainly have discriminated against them by demanding tests. That, of course, is no longer so. As I mentioned at an earlier stage in the Committee proceedings, the British Association of Insurers has now adopted a voluntary code under which that is not done.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para4"></a>I do not wish the Committee to misunderstand the issue. The amendment is limited, it does not seek to ask insurers to insure the uninsurable or to force them to take on uneconomic business. There are, however, circumstances where people with other disabilities need insurance and where a blanket exemption for the insurance industry would be unreasonable discrimination. To give the Committee a concrete example, in the past some insurers have simply refused travel insurance to people disabled with HIV. That could be understood if it were a concern about healthcare costs involved in a person becoming ill with HIV while he or she was away. But surely, most people have themselves, or know someone who has, lost a suitcase at an airport. Why should someone who has an incurable illness or a disability not be able to obtain travel insurance that excludes the conditions due to and specifically related to the illness for something such as the loss of his or her luggage?
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para5"></a>With short-term travel insurance, even against healthcare costs, a disabled person might well find themselves to be insurable although at a higher premium than that set for other people. Premiums should be set according to objective criteria on a purely actuarial basis. I believe that the insurance industry has every <P>


<a name="column_2012"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2012</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>right to assess the risk that it is undertaking and to determine which specific exclusion related to a precondition it would wish to impose on someone taking out a policy.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para6"></a>However, the clause worries me because I fear that it gives a blanket exemption. After what my noble friend said on the previous amendment, I hope that when he brings back an amendment on that matter he will also take this point into consideration. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I need to begin by declaring a non-pecuniary interest, in that I am chairman of MENCAP City Insurance Services. It is a company which we established precisely because people with learning disabilities and their families were finding it so difficult to get a fair deal in the existing insurance market. The creation of the company has, I think, acted as something of a goad to the insurance market elephant, making it a little more responsive to the disabled part of the market.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para7"></a>My contacts in the insurance industry before and since the setting up of MENCAP City Insurance have given me the realisation that in some instances discrimination is based not on actuarial tables or painful commercial experience, but on what I can only describe as prejudice and ignorance. It really is quite extraordinary how usually well-informed people can blunder into ill-informed decisions&#151;though I suppose that I should not be totally surprised when immigration rules of certain world powers have apparently been based on the assumption that Down's syndrome is a contagious disease!
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para8"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Baroness is inoffensively broad. It meets the Minister's point that actuarial evidence is not the only sort of reasonably objective evidence. Discrimination would, under the amendment, not be unfair where it can be justified, but would be unfair where it cannot be justified. I find it very hard to see any objections to that approach, and accordingly I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I shall be very brief. As it is getting late, I shall not produce examples. I very strongly support the amendment moved by my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   Very briefly, I associate myself with the sentiments of the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. I hope that a measure as reasonable as this is not needed in the Bill; but if it is, I wholeheartedly support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clifford of Chudleigh: </B>   On the subject of services and insurance, we are aware that risk is involved; that discrimination&#151;premium setting&#151;marks the quality of the insurer and of the underwriter. It is painfully clear that, like or not, Father Time, age and disease do not discriminate: we shall be, or are, struck by both inevitabilities.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para9"></a>Many disabled people, and those over the age of 75, are subject to discrimination should they wish to travel a long distance&#151;let us say, from England to Scotland&#151;by train, boat or air and, when they reach their destination, wish to hire a car. Although the Association of British Insurers has warned its members of the implications of the Disability Discrimination Bill, it <P>


<a name="column_2013"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2013</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>simply cannot direct its members to adopt a common approach towards the disabled, or to those over the age of 75, who drive a car.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para10"></a>In mentioning cars, I beg the Committee to digest the following information from the Association of British Insurers, which I received this morning. It may be of interest to the Committee that there is a 30 per cent. chance of claim in any one year in relation to drivers aged between 17 and 24 years of age, but an 18 per cent. chance of a claim in any one year in relation to those over the age of 70. It is also of interest to note that inquiries have been made and it is understood that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"market practice is that where an individual aged 74 or over seeks to hire a car the hirer will request clearance from the insurer".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para11"></a>That presumes that the person arrives during working hours, not at a weekend. Otherwise, how can a person who is over 75 be insured when hiring a car?
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para12"></a>Whether it be on business or holiday, a disabled person is subject to discrimination when hiring a car: It may be felt reasonable by the car hire company to impose a substantial increase of premium payment or&#151;to use a verb coined in the Committee stage on Tuesday&#151;it may "perceive" the risk to be unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para13"></a>The distance between London and Edinburgh is 378 miles. Many people travel there and to other parts of Scotland by train. Imagine how much more exhausting it is for those over the age of 75 and for those who are disabled but can drive. But Her Majesty's Government's attitude toward the rail network in the United Kingdom has put the rail services&#151;and so the British Government&#151;top of the pack as discriminators.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para14"></a>The franchising director for the rail services has had the subsidy for ScotRail reduced sufficiently to force the motor-rail services to Scotland to stop. At present, were the Government to return just &#163;7 million of the deducted subsidy, the franchising director could include Motorail in the privatised sale package, market it more fully, make a profit margin and make disabled drivers happier.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para15"></a>Perhaps we should remember that the blind cannot discriminate about the colour of our skin and the deaf cannot decipher our race from our tongue. The only discrimination shown by the disabled is appreciation of the degree of help received. Let us not discriminate against that.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Clifford, has gone rather wider than the amendment, which my noble friend Lady Gardner so concisely told us was limited in scope. I understand what she is aiming for. But I hope that my noble friend, in replying from the Front Bench, can dismiss any impression that the regulations will include blanket exclusions. Clearly, some people are worried about that.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para16"></a>I hope also that, when my noble friend replies, he will confirm my understanding that it is the intention that before regulations are drafted there will be consultation by the Government with the disabled organisations concerned and with the Association of British Insurers. This is a field in which the technical details need to be worked out in full with the Government by the disabled <P>


<a name="column_2014"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2014</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>organisations and the insurers. One hopes that then regulations of the right kind will emerge after the Bill has been enacted.
<P>

<a name="50615-30_para17"></a>This is a case&#151;I mentioned it on Tuesday&#151;where those concerned, including the disabled organisations, hope that too much will not be put into the Bill in the next two months which would prejudge all the consultations and work that they feel will have to go into the vitally important regulations which will come later.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   We recognise that some areas of service provision are complex and may present particular difficulties when we try to include them in the right of access. One such area undoubtedly is insurance.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para0"></a>The business of the insurance industry is to calculate risks and set premiums to correspond with those risks. Insurers necessarily treat people differently on the basis of the risks that they present. They treat us differently when it comes to house insurance as regards where our houses are located and treat us differently when it comes to car insurance with regard to where we live, and therefore where the car has its overnight accommodation.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para1"></a>Nevertheless, we have been convinced that disabled people, when they seek insurance cover, sometimes face unfair discrimination, whether in the form of a loaded premium or a refusal to provide cover at all. We want to ensure that the treatment of disabled customers is based on a reasonable assessment of risk rather than on any prejudicial assumptions of the insurer.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para2"></a>Officials in my department have had discussions with a number of organisations involved in the industry. So too have representatives of groups of and for disabled people. I think it would be fair to say that all parties see the benefit of a flexible framework for eliminating unfair discrimination in insurance.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para3"></a>I shall spare the Committee a talk about professional actuaries. All I will say is that any actuary I know is extraordinarily clever and usually a mathematician, which by definition means that they are more than just extraordinarily clever. It is an extremely complex business. All actuaries approach it with a great deal of intellectual rigour. Members of the Committee should not play down the seriousness with which they deal with their decisions. After all, if they get them wrong and the insurer is no longer able to pay out on claims, then all those who insured would suffer. It is not a business without a major downside if actuaries are forced to make decisions which they would not make in the light of their intellectual judgments and based on the scientific and mathematical evidence they collect.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para4"></a>We believe that there is only one workable way to outlaw unfair and unjustifiable discrimination in the insurance industry; that is, through regulations after full consultation with the insurance industry and groups representing the interests of disabled people. We are also keen to learn from the experience of the operation of the Australian Disability Discrimination Act with regard to insurance before we ourselves regulate. We will of course ensure that guidance and codes of practice are available before the regulations come into effect so that insurers and consumers know where they stand. <P>


<a name="column_2015"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2015</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Regulations will also allow us to cover all eventualities. It may be that over time they need to be amended if there are practical problems in their implementation. It is in the interests of insurers and consumers for the Government to be able to make such changes. For that reason we took the decision to make regulations, which can be more easily adapted than primary legislation. The main disability groups indicated that they have no difficulty accepting regulations, yet the amendments before us this evening would restrict the flexibility of the regulation-making power.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para5"></a>I can assure my noble friend that we will take her anxieties and those expressed by other Members of the Committee into account when drafting the regulations. However, I do not believe that the approach of her amendment would be workable or sufficiently flexible to deal with this complex area. For that reason I cannot possibly accept it. I hope that, after hearing my explanation, my noble friend will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-31_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I thank all those who supported the amendment. It is an important matter. The fact that on the face of the Bill at the moment is the phrase, "for example, insurance services" drew my attention to this issue. The clause as it stands may lead one to think that insurance people will not be bound in any way by the Bill. It looks like a blanket exemption. I am therefore considerably reassured by what my noble friend said on that point; that is, that the regulations will look to see that the insurance industry does not act unreasonably. Perhaps I can discuss that with him between now and the next stage of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para6"></a>I emphasise once more that my intention is not to ask the insurance companies to do something against the interests of their industry. As the noble Lord said, it treats people differently. I wrote that down. He said that it should treat people differently. I do not agree. I believe that it should treat everyone the same way on the basis of assessing each case on its merits in the full light of an honest declaration by the party of what adverse condition he or she is suffering from in terms of disability or ill health. We are aware of famous cases in America where, when word got around that HIV infection was spreading, large numbers of people immediately rushed to take out insurance. The insurance industry was badly caught. On the whole, however, if someone fails to declare a condition of which they are aware, that is fraud and invalidates the insurance. So the insurance industry is protected against fraud. I am saying that it should be able to look at each case on its actuarial merits and then assess what premium should relate to that. To that extent I believe that each person should be treated the same. He or she should be treated as a possible customer and offered insurance cover to suit his or her requirements.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para7"></a>This is a very important issue and one which we shall have to discuss further. The noble Lord said that he himself will be looking further into it. I shall have to persuade him of my view. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="50615-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain </B>   moved Amendment No. 76:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 11, line 24, at end insert:
<br>
("( ) Regulations may make provision as to the minimum level of adjustment required to freestanding and automated facilities which provide goods or services to comply with section 15.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-31_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: This may seem a small point but it is easy to overlook the ever-increasing automation of services, as I mentioned at Second Reading, from cash machines to vending machines. This has led to a significant improvement in all levels of service.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para11"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that definitive regulations are drawn up under the legislation establishing clear standards for such facilities which will set the minimum that needs to be done for the life of the machine. There is a danger that if the commitment is too open-ended and further adjustments to machines can be demanded their economic viability will be drastically reduced. We need to ensure that in prescribing what businesses must do under the legislation these requirements are not counterproductive and that when regulations are drawn up consideration will be given to alternative ways of delivering the service. It would be a waste and indeed contrary to the spirit of the legislation if, as a result of a lack of clarity, there were fewer such facilities after its introduction than before. Instead we need to ensure that these facilities are as accessible as they reasonably can be and that they form part of a movement towards better services for all customers, including disabled people. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   This is a sensible amendment. The noble Baroness and the Committee will already know that British Telecom is putting automated telephones at a height that can be used by people in wheelchairs and some vending machines have already been fixed at that height. But it would be wrong to insist on adjustments to vending machines where a certain amount of pressure was not required to produce the goods they sell. If someone was to brush lightly past with their coat he could discharge vast amounts of chocolate or whatever it happened to be when no one had put in any money. As the noble Baroness said, one has to be very sensible. It is a matter of common sense. I am glad that it has been brought to the Committee's attention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   This amendment draws attention to a number of problems. As I have explained, Clause 15 is intended to apply, with very few exceptions, to service providers right across the economy. In covering such a wide range of goods, facilities and services, we are bound to encounter a few sectors which present particular problems in implementation. This is one such area. We intend to deal with such difficult areas by means of regulation after full consultation with those having a particular interest or experience of that service provision. We already have adequate regulation-making powers within the Bill to deal with this kind of difficulty.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para12"></a>I do not want to be drawn down the route of adding regulation-making powers to deal with each area of service provision that we anticipate might not be straightforward. I am therefore unable to accept my noble <P>


<a name="column_2017"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2017</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend's amendment. However, I recognise that the issue of automated service provision is one for careful consideration, not least because vending machines and other such facilities represent an important sector of service provision. Banking services provided through ATMs are a particularly good example. I cannot remember when I last went into a bank to get money; I think that many people are in the same position. However, the issue of accessibility to automated facilities is problematic, not least because it raises the question of the manufacture of the machines. As noble Lords will be aware, the Government do not believe that the Bill can or should cover the manufacture of goods.
<P>

<a name="50615-31_para13"></a>I have listened to the comments of both my noble friends and can assure them and the Committee that we shall take the matters raised into account when seeking to regulate in this area. I firmly believe, however, that the regulation-making power in the Bill already allows us to make provision for that area and, as I have said, I think that it would be wrong to set about introducing powers to deal specifically with each potentially difficult type of service. With that reassurance, I hope that my noble friend will withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Swinfen </B>   moved Amendment No. 77:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 11, line 40, at end insert:
<br>
("where it is not reasonable under all the circumstances of the case for a provider to make provision under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c)").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-32_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 77, I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 78, 79 and 82. I had intended to deal with the amendments separately, but at this hour of the night and for the convenience of the Committee, perhaps it is wiser to deal with them all at once.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para4"></a>Amendment No. 77 is designed to ensure that an alternative means of providing a service is pursued only as a last option. The aim of the legislation must be to ensure that disabled people have similar opportunities to anybody else to take part in ordinary life. There will be occasions when the "separate-but-equal" approach is justified; for example, for a number of reasons parents may opt to educate a disabled child at a special school in preference to a mainstream school, but that should be on the basis of an informed choice, not because it is the only available option.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para5"></a>However, Clause 15 raises the issue in a narrower context; for example, when barriers in the built environment prevent a disabled person from getting into the premises where a service is provided. In such <P>


<a name="column_2018"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2018</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances, provision of an alternative service must be a last resort, to be considered only when alterations to the building are unreasonably difficult.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para6"></a>Amendment No. 78 is a probing amendment, trying to find out the Government's intention concerning the application of the right of access created by Part III to historic buildings. Where alterations to premises are required to facilitate access for disabled people, there may in some instances be a degree of conflict with the desire to preserve the fabric of an historic building. An automatic exemption granted to all historic buildings means that many disabled people are unable to visit historic sites. It also deprives them of the use of the many public facilities operated from listed premises, which are now used as hotels, town halls, banks and theatres, for example.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para7"></a>There has been growing recognition in recent years that that is not a tenable position. Recent government planning advice exemplifies an important shift in attitude, stating:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is important in principle that disabled people should have dignified easy access to and within historic buildings. If it is treated as part of an integrated review of access requirements for all visitors or users, and a flexible and pragmatic approach is taken, it should normally be possible to plan suitable access for disabled people without compromising a building's use of spaces and may achieve the desired result without the need for damaging alterations".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para8"></a>The amendment would require regulations to provide guidance on that crucial issue. The value of a framework which included consultation with building users when faced with tough decisions about access cannot be over-emphasised. It enables decision-makers to avoid the passions of the competing interest groups and to emerge with a coherent set of priorities. I suggest that the essential starting point in drawing up such guidance should be an examination of the building's function. The goal should be to achieve the most dignified access consistent with the building's function. Dignified access should be integrated as far as possible and not around the back with the dustbins.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para9"></a>A different approach would be appropriate for historic house museums. In that case the preservation of the building is the key to the function of the site, but the visiting public are an essential strategy for maintaining the building's use.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para10"></a>I could continue on the amendment, but as it is late I will not. However, my noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu has asked me to say that he supports the amendment and that English Heritage is in favour of it. I have also had a letter from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, who rightly advises me that at a later stage of the Bill I shall have to include a reference to Section 52(7) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act l972 because at the moment my amendment deals only with England, and historic buildings legislation deals with Scotland too.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para11"></a>The next amendment in the group introduces the concept of transitional or action plans drawn up by service providers themselves, implementing access over a number of years. As in Australia, these plans would be voluntary but could be used in defence of a claim made against the service provider. The Bill includes a duty for businesses to take reasonable steps to remove physical barriers and provide communication and other <P>


<a name="column_2019"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2019</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>auxiliary aids. As access is one of the most fundamental causes and manifestations of discrimination against disabled people, it is a provision that needs careful planning.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para12"></a>Forward-looking service providers in this country are already familiar with the concept of planned access improvements and many businesses already prepare access strategies. Under the Citizen's Charter all local authorities are required to audit access provision in their buildings open to the public and some are already using these audits as a basis for planned improvement programmes.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para13"></a>The fourth and final amendment in the group is designed to remove the cost cap of access provision. It is a probing amendment only. Clause 15 relates to the duties of service providers to make adjustments so that disabled people have access to their services. That may be done by changing policies and procedures; improving physical access arrangements; and/or providing aids to communication and other auxiliary aids.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para14"></a>Subsections (8) and (9) provide for a prescribed maximum expenditure to be calculated according to the circumstances, length of time, type of service and premises and as yet unspecified criteria. The cost cap may well prove to be irrelevant to forward-looking businesses, many of which are already investing money to make their services more accessible, recognising the competitive advantage of so doing. For less enlightened service providers, the overly complex formulation for the cost cap could provide the ultimate excuse for inaction and an effective deterrent to successful negotiations for disabled people seeking access improvements.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para15"></a>A similar formulation for the removal of physical barriers in buildings to allow access for disabled people without a cost cap is used in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons (Amendment) Act 1976, and in Part M of the building regulations. Neither has had a detrimental impact on businesses. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-32_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I support Amendment No. 77 and I shall speak also to Amendment No. 78. Amendment No. 77 relates to integration, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, said, we are trying to avoid a "ghettoisation" of facilities&#151;an apartheid of provision. We seek within the framework of reasonable cost for the provision for disabled people to be integrated and not segregated. Perhaps I may put that at its most basic: if non-disabled people are able to enter a building through one door, we should avoid expecting disabled people to enter through another door, round the back by the dustbins and the lavatories. Their entrance should be both easy and dignified.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para16"></a>It is worth reminding ourselves that often in the process the benefits spill over on to a much wider group of people than those with a physical disability. For example, when one replaces a heavy internal fire door with an automatic door it is not only disabled people who enjoy better mobility within the building but it is valuable for women with children and pushchairs and for the elderly. Similarly, if a main entrance is unsuitable for disabled people we should consider <P>


<a name="column_2020"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2020</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether a different entrance which is fully accessible should become the main entrance for everyone. Again that would help other people.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para17"></a>As regards the planning of domestic housing, if instead of only some houses being built to mobility standard, all were so built, such homes could become lifetime homes, whatever people's circumstances. Building houses to mobility standard is infinitely cheaper than subsequently adjusting and widening doorways, adding extra insulation and all the other things that are needed for disability sufferers. Amendment No. 77 has our strong support.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para18"></a>I wish to speak briefly to Amendment No. 78. It relates to a difficult topic but I believe that the difficulties recently described in the press were greatly exaggerated. I speak as a former English Heritage Commissioner and someone who has been actively involved in conservation in my own city. We all accept that when dealing with listed buildings the principles of conservation must be paramount. Planning consent for any alterations will and must be required. Listed buildings are crucial to our sense of place and to our city streetscapes. Disabled people as much as others are entitled not to have their listed buildings disfigured.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para19"></a>I believe that most disabled people agree that when someone in a wheelchair goes out in the countryside they do not expect to have tarmac paths because the roughness of the path is part of being in the countryside. However, the principle of conservation as found, which is the principle of modern conservation, means that one does not strip a building back to its original date of use but one accepts and reads the accretions to that building which have come as a result of adaptations and changes as society has changed. In other words, the history of a building as well as its aesthetics is part of the conservation principles that we are examining. There is no reason to believe that access is not part of the adaptation of buildings, with the fabric continually renewing itself.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para20"></a>It is also worth emphasising that far more can be done to make listed buildings accessible to disabled people than is often believed. The fabric of listed buildings need not be untouchable. In my city, for example, we have attached a short-rise lift to our medieval public hall, which is a Grade I listed building. Bad adaptations disfigure a building but good adaptations do not need to. Winchester Cathedral, for example, has installed a platform lift in its north transept so that wheelchair users can have access to the choir, can enjoy the ceilings and so forth. It has received the full support of English Heritage.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para21"></a>I could give many more examples of which I am aware where adaptations have worked within the fabric of a Grade I or Grade II listed building. As the Norwich Disability Access Officer said, there is usually a way. Too often, private owners of listed buildings believe that they will not be given planning consent for alterations when, with discussion with the conservation architects and disability access officers, they could find a way of access.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para22"></a>Often Tudor houses serve as museums. By definition, there is limited internal physical access. The answer may not be to try to make the physical fabric move but to make the displays move so that on a rotating basis the upstairs displays are brought downstairs, amplified <P>


<a name="column_2021"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2021</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with videos and the like. Everyone may then enjoy all the artefacts and objects held by the museum, even though they cannot gain full access to the fabric because it is a sensitive building.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para23"></a>Equally, the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, was entirely right to say that, where a listed building houses a function for which public access is vitally important&#151;for example, a housing benefit service or a post office&#151;and that building cannot be made accessible, then that function should be transferred to another building. That is what we should seek to do in those situations.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para24"></a>But, of course, the sad truth is that most public listed buildings are held by local authorities as owners of the last resort and seeking a function of last resort. Again, my city owns&#151;so to speak&#151;something like 30 mediaeval churches, not all of which have adequate access. We have found uses for almost all of them, ranging from tea shops to scout clubs to brass rubbing centres and martial arts clubs. It is no kindness to anyone to say that because, for example, 5 per cent. of the population cannot gain access to those buildings, the other 95 per cent. should not and that the building should remain unused, fall into disrepair and possibly be vandalised.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para25"></a>I take a great deal of interest in these matters and I regretted very much the exaggerated response of a member of the Georgian Group in his article about this Bill published in British Archaeology. He said that it was a time bomb and gave such examples as Hadrian's Wall having to have lifts and tarmac surfaces and said he thought that the damage which would result to monuments would be devastating. That was an absurdly exaggerated response, if only for the practical reason that it is beyond reasonable cost.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para26"></a>The author of that article insisted that disabled access officers were too often extraordinarily doctrinaire and that the fabric of a listed building or monument would have to give way to doctrinaire access officers. I remember once visiting some early eighteenth century weavers' cottages to hand over a cheque on behalf of English Heritage. When I came to the little room which was the kitchen, in that eighteenth century weaver's cottage was a 1950s black plastic and chromium bath. I said merrily, "Well, now, with this cheque, you will be able to get rid of the bath, won't you, and use the kitchen as a tea room?" "Oh no", they said, "We're not allowed to. We have been told by the conservationists that this 1950s chromium bath is an essential part of the history and palimpsest of this building, so this 1950s chromium bath must remain in this early 18th century weaver's cottage". That was absurd, doctrinaire and equally unreasonable.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para27"></a>I hope and expect that both English Heritage and the Department of the Environment would issue appropriate design guidance. We want a commitment to the integrated use and enjoyment of cultural, civic and historic buildings and monuments for all people. A way usually can be found if people are sensible, respect the <P>

At this hour, I shall not repeat what has been said so competently by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, and the noble Baroness. However, there are a few questions as regards cost capping at which we should ask the Minister to look.
<P>

<a name="50615-32_para28"></a>How is a business's ability to pay going to be calculated? Rateable value would not take into account the differing financial positions of a large superstore or a small village shop. Service providers are to be able to stagger their service improvements over a number of years. How will the cost cap take that into account? Will the cost cap apply only to the alteration to buildings or to every aspect of the service provision such as, for example, the production of information in an accessible format, staff training and time taken in formulating company policy? No other equal opportunities legislation&#151;either in relation to race or gender&#151;is subject to a cost cap. The low ceiling of a cost cap may encourage service providers to do a bit of window dressing rather than tackling what are the priority access improvements. Therefore, how will the Government ensure that the improvements will be made and how will the cost cap work?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-33_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I am concerned about Amendment No. 82, which seeks to take away the prescribed maximum, or the cap, on expenditure that a provider of services must spend. That prescribed maximum is an important way of satisfying the natural concerns about overspend that businesses have. To remove subsections (8) and (9) would make it an open-ended commitment and could result in a parsimonious approach; or, indeed, looking at ways to get around it being considered by the provider of services. So I have a genuine concern in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   I support the amendments tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen. I must apologise to the noble Lord for missing the first part of his introductory speech, but I am afraid that messages have to be passed on and, when you are the only Member on the Bench, you have to leave the Committee to deal with them.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para0"></a>Basically the suggested provisions are very reasonable. Once again, I hope that the Government will adopt a favourable attitude. I should tell the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, that I actually recognised one or two of the things that she described when talking about a certain church in Norwich. Indeed, I was playing quite a nice game in trying to think exactly where was the church that had become a boxing hall and the other that had become a tea-shop. I believe that Norwich has one thing right as regards using its old buildings.

<A NAME="50615-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   We have had a useful and wide-ranging discussion on the amendments. While, obviously, it is getting late, I should like to take just a little time to explain the position, which I hope will satisfy a number of concerns that have been expressed.
<P>


<a name="column_2023"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2023</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para1"></a>The integration of disabled people into society is an aspiration which we all share. The Disability Discrimination Bill will, over time, result in dramatic changes involving millions of people taking positive action to make that integration a reality. Although the word does not appear on the face of the legislation, it is quite right that integration is part and parcel of the duty that we owe to disabled people in creating a more accessible environment. But, as Members of the Committee will agree, the Government also have a duty to ensure that legislation allows a sufficient degree of flexibility for service providers to develop their own solutions to accessibility problems&#151;solutions which, of course, meet the needs of disabled people but which are also practical and relevant to the business and affordable.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para2"></a>The key objective of the goods and services provision in Part III is to ensure that services are not impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use. Clause 15 sets out the broad framework within which that will be achieved by changing policies, practices or procedures, by supplying aids to communication or by taking steps to negate the effect of physical barriers. That is a crucial part of our policy.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para3"></a>Within that framework, it will be up to the service providers themselves to decide how best their services can be adapted to meet the needs of actual people as long as, by doing so, they are made reasonably accessible. In our view Amendment No. 77 runs contrary to that principle. It would mean that in many cases businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses, would be prevented from looking at ways in which their services could be adapted to suit disabled people by delivering them in a different way.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para4"></a>We think that that would be too strict a limitation on business. Further, as my honourable friend, the Minister for Disabled People, has said on a number of occasions (and as was set out very clearly in the cost compliance assessment which accompanied the Bill), the legislation has been deliberately drafted in a way that ensures that sensible, low-cost accessibility solutions are encouraged wherever possible, so long as they are reasonable. The amendment could impose much unnecessary cost on businesses in situations where to contemplate expensive building work which might be considered reasonable in its own right would be to fly in the face of common sense if, as a prior option, a work-around solution could not be considered as well.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para5"></a>Obviously, I want to make it quite clear that there will be occasions when physical alterations will be the only reasonable solution because physical access to premises is a fundamental attribute of the service. I am thinking, for example, of restaurants, theatres, art galleries and so on.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para6"></a>It would clearly not be reasonable for the proprietor of a cafe to suggest that a take-away meal was a suitable alternative to making an adjustment to the layout or construction of his premises which would allow disabled people to enter. Further, the mere fact of physical access would not be enough. The means of entrance must be reasonable.
<P>


<a name="column_2024"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2024</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para7"></a>It would not be reasonable&#151;to refer to the example given by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis&#151;to expect a wheelchair user to have to negotiate the rubbish bins and general detritus of a back alley to be let into a restaurant via the kitchens, but there will be instances where such access is not essential to the service on offer. For example, as regards a theatre ticket office of the sort one sees in the West End, a wheelchair user may be unable to get into the shop because of a steep step at the entrance and asks whether the shopkeeper would consider purchasing a portable ramp. The ramp may cost &#163;200 or &#163;300; not a trifling amount but not an excessive amount of money either, and possibly a reasonable expense for the service provider to be put to. However, as an alternative, the ticket agency is prepared to provide a free phone ordering and tickets by mail service. This is an obvious and sensible solution to a practical problem which will provide the disabled person with reasonable access to the service and be of benefit to many others as well, but a solution which would be denied by this amendment.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para8"></a>I sympathise with those who want to see a more accessible physical environment sooner rather than later; indeed this Bill will do much to bring this about, but we have to face the fact that the building stock in this country is old, two-thirds of it being built before the turn of the century. We will not have fully accessible buildings overnight and if the Government try to force businesses to provide them that will fail. It is the businessmen of this country who will provide access to goods and services for disabled people, not politicians. We know that the great majority of service providers wish to play a part and we owe it to them to provide a sufficiently flexible regulatory framework to allow them to get on and do the job. I hope that what I have said will help satisfy and reasssure those noble Lords and noble Baronesses who have expressed concern on this point.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para9"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 78. As has already been said by others, I am aware of the concern over how listed properties will be treated under the Bill. I hope to explain matters and clear up a lot of the misunderstandings and the difficulties. The Disability Discrimination Bill affords a good deal of protection for service providers and employers who occupy listed buildings. Clause 32 provides that nothing done to comply with other legislation, whether passed before or after the Bill, shall be made unlawful by the Bill. This means that if a service provider is unable to carry out works because in doing so he would be breaching other legislations, he cannot then be in breach of the disability Bill in respect of that particular act. So if, for example, listed building consent to replace a medieval archway with a pair of sliding doors was refused, the service provider who then declined to install the new doorway could not be held to have discriminated against a disabled person for whom the building remained consequently inaccessible. In other words, Clause 32 will prevent people having to act without listed building consent in order to comply with the Bill. The same principle will apply to scheduled monuments. However, I must make it clear&#151;

<A NAME="50615-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I have covered that point. It is mentioned in Clause 32&#151;which is a short clause&#151;which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nothing in this Act makes unlawful any act done&#151;in pursuance of any enactment".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para10"></a>It is quite clear that the provision both looks forward and back.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para11"></a>I wish to elaborate further so that there is no misunderstanding about what this provision means. I must make it clear that this provision does not amount to an exemption for listed buildings. In our view, it is right that material adjustments for which listed building consent would be granted will have to be considered. We are going back to the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, made when she talked of some examples in Norwich. I am rather sorry that my noble friend Lord Mackay is not in his place because I am sure he would be terrified at the thought of her going to the martial arts centre with regard to the next time they face each other across the Dispatch Box.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I know who would win!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   A good "big un" is always better than a good "little un". The aim must be a workable system by which the need to apply for listed building consent can be avoided in cases where it is obvious that an application will be refused. Great strides have been taken in recent years to make historic buildings which are open to the public more accessible. English Heritage and local authorities have considerable experience in advising owners how to adapt historic buildings to meet these needs without detracting from the intrinsic value for which the building is protected.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para12"></a>English Heritage is currently producing guidance on how to approach proposals for making historic buildings and monuments more accessible to disabled people and will be co-operating with the Centre for Accessible Environments in holding seminars later this year to bring those with responsibilities for access together with those, such as local authority conservation officers, dealing with listed buildings. That guidance could prove to be a very valuable tool to disabled people, employers, service providers and their advisers when it comes to resolving any disputes which may arise in this area. It could be that the national disability council will wish to incorporate some or all of that guidance into its codes of practice.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para13"></a>I hope that I have been able to demonstrate why the amendment is unnecessary. I hope that my noble friend may consider withdrawing it.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para14"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 79, I listened with interest to the arguments in favour of transition plans and I found myself in sympathy with much of what was said. The transition plan idea is certainly worth considering. I am aware that the Australian <P>


<a name="column_2026"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2026</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>anti-discrimination legislation contains a similar provision, and a good place to start would be to seek information from Australia on how well the scheme operates over there.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para15"></a>There could be difficulties. Who, for instance, would decide whether the plans were bona fide? We would want to avoid the necessity of parties having to go to court to establish that. Also, how much leeway would companies be allowed if, for example, following a downturn in the business cycle, a trader did not have sufficient resources to carry out the improvements scheduled for a particular year? And, of course, we would need to decide whether disabled people whose disabilities were not fully catered for in the plan could bring actions against the service provider.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para16"></a>Nevertheless, any idea which seeks to offer some incentive to business to approach accessibility in a structured way is well worth investigating, and we shall continue to look very closely at what might be done.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para17"></a>However, we are not yet at a stage where we could be certain about the proper form of words that would need to be put on the face of the Bill, or whether we could make use of secondary legislation. Therefore, if my noble friend and the noble Baroness whose name is also down to the amendment would consent to withdraw it, I will undertake to take the matter away and consider where the best way forward lies.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para18"></a>Finally, I should like to turn briefly to Amendment No. 82. The power to set a financial limit on the cost of meeting the duties to make adjustments is an essential one if businesses and service providers are to have confidence in the legislation. The Bill has been designed to ensure that the move to a more accessible environment will not place undue burdens on those who will be responsible for delivering its provisions. In forming our proposals we have taken account of the understandable concerns of the business community that the legislation should not be unrealistically ambitious. I believe that the Bill strikes a fair balance between the needs of disabled people and the perfectly respectable need of a business to make a reasonable profit.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para19"></a>In our view, the ability to set a financial limit is a crucial element in that balance in that it gives certainty to business. That was a point to which my noble friend Lady O'Cathain drew our attention. However, turning to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman, we recognise that there are a number of ways in which a test of affordability could be fashioned: different ways in which the size or value of premises or the size or status of businesses can be assessed in order to produce a variable but easy to understand measurement. We have not as yet formed any firm views as to the best way forward. The Government will consult fully with businesses and organisations of and for disabled people alike on whether a financial cap would be helpful and, if so, how it would be calculated.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para20"></a>The provisions of subsections (8) and (9) inject the legislation with a crucial measure of flexibility. The limit could, for example, cater for aggregate amounts of expenditure incurred in different cases, so that a service provider could consult a local access officer, plan a series of improvements to improve access over a period of time and be reassured that, just because individual <P>


<a name="column_2027"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2027</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>elements of that plan did not come up to the financial limit, he could not be required to make further alterations. That would account for the wide variety of modifications that might be considered: for example, installing a ramp, widening doors or perhaps removing obstructions from corridors or shopping aisles. Such a provision would be a fair way of ensuring that a service provider who planned ahead would not run the risk of having greater liabilities than a service provider who chose to delay taking any action until forced to do so by the threat of legal action.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para21"></a>The financial cap remains an important part of the government proposals. To prevent unwarranted burdens being placed on business we must be in a position to control the application of the legislation.
<P>

<a name="50615-33_para22"></a>Members of the Committee having heard my explanation of the Government's position, I very much hope that my noble friend Lord Swinfen will feel able to withdraw his amendment. I hope that I have covered the points and given reassurance.

<A NAME="50615-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My noble friend has given a full and interesting answer to all four amendments, providing a certain amount of encouragement. However, there is a certain amount in his reply that I am not sure I like. However, I shall read carefully what he said. It is possible that I may come back to the matter at a later stage of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para1"></a>[Amendments Nos. 78 and 79 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Inglewood </B>   moved Amendment No. 80:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 12, line 1, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-34_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 80, I speak briefly to Amendment No. 81. The effect of the amendment is to remove from the face of the Bill the subsection which exempts those service providers whose buildings comply with Part M of the building regulations from the requirement to make physical alterations to their premises. We have done this because, as we now believe, the provision does not wholly fulfil the Government's policy intention. But, as I shall explain, we have not abandoned our view that service providers need to be protected from double jeopardy. It may assist the Committee if I take a few minutes to explain some of the background.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para3"></a>For noble Lords who are unaware, Part M has operated since 1988 as that part of the building regulations which sets out what is required in the way of access for disabled people. It applies to all new non-domestic buildings and most extensions. It requires reasonable provision to be made so that disabled people can gain access to and make use of buildings including, for example, lavatories and, if relevant, audience and spectator seating. It requires facilities to be provided both for wheelchair users and for those who have impaired hearing or eyesight.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para4"></a>The Government take the view that service providers should be able to rely on Part M of the building regulations as representing a bona fide national standard of accessibility for disabled people. That is why we decided to include a subsection which exempts from the <P>


<a name="column_2028"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2028</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>duty to make physical alterations any service provider whose premises have already complied with Part M. It is only natural justice that a service provider who sets up in a new building which complies with building regulations should be entitled to believe that his premises have been certified as accessible. Can it really then be reasonable for a court, in enforcing the Disability Discrimination Bill, to decide otherwise?
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para5"></a>However, we now recognise that the subsection as drafted is something of a blunt instrument and that the problem needs to be tackled in a rather more sophisticated way. We know that there will be some buildings which complied with a version of the building regulations, perhaps as long ago as 1988 but which would no longer meet the requirements of the latest version. Those buildings might lack suitable accommodation for those with sensory impairments, provision for which did not figure in the early versions of the regulations. That could result in cases where a service provider might escape a duty to make an adjustment to cater for the real needs of a disabled person on what would be little more than a technicality.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para6"></a>This would not only be galling for the disabled person but also for any service providers who, in exactly similar premises, apart from the fact that they were built in, say, 1987 rather than 1988, would have to make an adaptation. Their building would pre-date the building regulations and could thus not claim the benefit of building regulations exemption. In fact, a case can be made for extending the coverage of an exemption to cover any feature of a building which comes up to some other nationally defined standard&#151;irrespective of the age of the building and irrespective of whether it has ever had to comply with Part M. Not only would this put service providers in older buildings on the same footing as those in new ones, which would be equitable; it would also encourage more service providers to undertake accessibility improvements in advance of the commencement of the duty to make physical alterations.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para7"></a>There is much to consider here and we have yet to reach any definite conclusions on the matter. This is very likely to be one of the areas where, probably in the early part of next year, we shall be consulting with business and organisations of and for disabled people to hear their views on the best way forward.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para8"></a>But it is clear that the issue is too involved for simple treatment on the face of the Bill and that it would be better to use the regulation-making power available in Clause 15(6) of the Bill and pursue the point in secondary legislation where we shall have the latitude to do justice to the subtleties of the problem.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para9"></a>Perhaps I may briefly comment on Amendment No. 81 standing in the name of my noble friend Lady O'Cathain. We believe it to be unnecessary both because we have given a commitment to regulate in this area and because the existing regulation-making powers in Clause 15 are sufficient for the purpose.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para10"></a>I very much hope that with what I said earlier I have been able to inspire a sufficient degree of trust in our intentions to persuade my noble friend that she might withdraw her amendment. Nonetheless, I beg to move Amendment No. 80.

However, he cannot be perfect, I suppose.

<a name="50615-34_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, said that a building that did not conform to Part M would have been built earlier but sometimes buildings which supposedly conform to that regulation do not. In some local authority areas, officials are lax in applying the rules and in other areas they are not quite aware of what is needed. Anyway, I am delighted to support the amendment.

("( ) Before issuing any regulations under this section, the Secretary of State shall consult such persons as he considers appropriate, including appropriate organisations representative of employers and appropriate organisations representative of disabled persons.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-34_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: The concern is simply that without the requirement in the amendment, a costing figure in regulations or the formula for calculating it, which are important ways of delivering the clarity which the service providers require, could be changed arbitrarily. If it were decreased, it would be to the detriment of the disabled and if it were increased dramatically and suddenly, it would be to the detriment of business and customers, including the disabled. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-34_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   At this time of night, I hope it is sufficient reason for supporting the amendment to say that it would save a vast amount of parliamentary time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My noble friend's amendments seek to ensure that before issuing regulations under Clauses 15 or 19 of the Bill the Secretary of State shall consult with appropriate organisations representing employers and disabled people. A similar amendment has already been considered in relation to another part of the Bill and I can only reiterate what I said. I can assure the Committee that the Government intend to consult fully with interested parties before exercising the regulation-making powers contained in the Bill. This is likely to involve consulting with groups of and for disabled people and those representing the interests of business. However, I cannot agree that the Secretary of State should be under an obligation to consult with specified categories of people regardless of the subject of the regulations to be issued.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para15"></a>I believe that these amendments are unnecessary. The Government have made clear all along their intention to consult fully before using the powers in the Bill. Indeed, such consultation will be crucial to ensure that the regulations are fair and workable. I hope that that will provide some reassurance to my noble friend and that she will consider withdrawing the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-34_para21"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 85, I wish also to speak to Amendment No. 86. The amendments seek to clarify the exemption of "small dwellings" from the provisions on sale and letting of premises. The measures, including the small dwellings exemption, mirror those in sex and race discrimination legislation.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para22"></a>Clause 17 sets out the exemption for "small dwellings" from the provisions in Clause 16. These will make it unlawful for a person with the power to dispose of premises to discriminate against a disabled person.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para23"></a>In the provisions relating to the small dwellings exemption, the person with the power to dispose of the premises, or whose consent is required before premises can be disposed of, is referred to as the "relevant occupier". One of the conditions for the small dwellings exemption to operate is that the "relevant occupier", or a "near relative" of his, must actually live on the premises in question.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para24"></a>"Near relative" is defined in the earlier anti-discrimination legislation as including, among others, a person's "spouse". However, in recognition of those couples who live together before marrying (or who do not intend to marry), and in line with more recent legislation, the word "partner" has been added.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para25"></a>These two amendments define "partner" as the other member of a couple consisting of a man and a woman who are not married to each other but are living together as husband and wife. The need to identify whether someone is or is not a partner arises only if the "relevant occupier" is not actually present on the premises at the point in time when discrimination is alleged: for example, where he or she was temporarily away on business.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para26"></a>It might seem a contradiction for Clause 17 to talk about partners "living together" when in order for this provision to operate they would actually have to be apart, but I can assure the House that, just as we would not expect married couples to spend 24 hours a day, seven days a week in each other's company&#151;that is certainly true of anyone coming up to London to this House, attractive though that prospect may be to some, though, I hasten to add, not to me&#151;the same would apply to an unmarried couple temporarily separated.
<P>

<a name="50615-34_para27"></a>These amendments clarify the small dwellings exemption from the general provisions relating to the sale or letting of premises and I commend them to the House.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-35_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a complicated amendment. It deals with the fact that if something is "void" it cannot be made "voidable". Subsections (3) to (6) of Clause 21 provide that if such a clause is found, a person can go to court and have the provision made void; that is, removed or modified. If it is already "void", it cannot be made void. Clearly, under Clause 21(1) the provision in the contract would be void anyway. This is a legal point: something that is void cannot be made void again; it was discriminatory in the first place. This is a point of tautology, a lawyer's point. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I suppose, as one of that species, I had better speak to this amendment. Obviously my noble friend's amendment seeks to remove from Clause 21 the ability of either a county or sheriff court to replace or modify contract terms that have been made void due to the fact that they frustrate the operation of Part III of the Bill. I have listened carefully to why my noble friend thinks that this is necessary, but I have to confess that I am not convinced by her arguments. The crucial point here is that the contract is made and it contains within it various provisions. Certain of those provisions&#151;the terms of the contract&#151;are void, so far as they purport to do the matters described in Clause 21(1) (a) (b) or (c). But under the latter part of the clause, it is possible for an application to be made either to the county court or to the sheriff court to have the void clauses (they still exist; they are merely void) modified so that they can take effect in a manner which is to the benefit of those who have entered into the contract.
<P>

<a name="50615-35_para9"></a>I believe that the point made by the noble Baroness is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the contract and the way in which contract law works. Against that background, I hope that I shall be able to persuade her that these subsections are an important part of the Bill.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-36_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: I am now where I thought that I was a moment ago. In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group (Amendments Nos. 94 to 99, 143, 144 and 147). These amendments deal with taxis. I know that this is a subject of some concern to this Committee. A number of powerful points were made on this subject during the course of the Second Reading debate.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para2"></a>Over the past decade taxis have increasingly provided an invaluable form of transport to disabled people. But one can only provide quality and freedom of opportunity to disabled people in this field if all vehicles are indeed accessible. Some areas have tried to achieve accessibility through the introduction of a mixed fleet. But that is simply not sustainable in the reality of taxi licensing and operations. We have evidence from areas like Stockton on Tees, where such a system was tried and failed.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para3"></a>It is therefore the Government's clear intention, as part of the package of measures covering all forms of domestic, land-based public transport, to bring before this Chamber, in the course of our deliberations on this Bill, provisions to require that, from days to be determined, taxis newly licensed must, as a condition of licence, be accessible to all disabled people, including those who use wheelchairs.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para4"></a>Let me make it absolutely clear that we are not talking about a universal requirement for the current purpose-built taxi design. I make no apology for stressing the point because I feel that it has been widely misunderstood and misinterpreted by sections of the trade. It is vital to the proposals that I now want to put before the Committee that that point is understood.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para5"></a>Amendment No. 93 is the first of a number of new clauses which set out the powers we propose to take to ensure both that the vehicles themselves are accessible and that the drivers of those vehicles play their part in offering a service to disabled passengers.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para6"></a>Amendment No. 93 is proposed so that the Secretary of State can make regulations defining standards of access which new taxis will be required to meet and so that taxi drivers can be required to carry disabled passengers in a safe and appropriate manner. Full accessibility is an important concept. There has been <P>


<a name="column_2036"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2036</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>criticism of the current models of wheelchair-accessible taxi that, while they can satisfactorily accommodate the vast majority of wheelchair users, they are difficult&#151;or indeed impossible&#151;for many elderly and disabled people; for example, those with arthritis who are not wheelchair users.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para7"></a>This point is fundamental to the proposals I am now putting before the Committee. The regulations which will follow from this enabling power will focus clearly on the needs of all disabled people and will be drawn up in close consultation with the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. We will be defining design parameters based on research and experience to provide optimum levels of accessibility. We will expect a range of manufacturers to address the market that will be created.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para8"></a>The second part of this clause is simply to ensure that, once accessible vehicles are widely available, taxi drivers recognise that it is a fundamental part of their duties to carry disabled passengers using the relevant equipment in the correct and safe way. While most taxi drivers are only too willing to provide a service for disabled passengers, I am sorry to say that it is not unusual to hear reports of drivers who have refused to pick up a passenger in a wheelchair on the pretext, for example, that they are not carrying the ramps.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para9"></a>The purpose of the new clause in Amendment No. 94 is to ensure an orderly transition to the new requirements without damaging the viability of the taxi trade. That, of course, is the last thing we want to do. Subsection (1) provides that a licensing authority may, after a certain date, only license taxis which comply with the construction requirements that will be set out in the regulations.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para10"></a>We are also mindful of the need to protect the interests of the cab trade, much of which comprises small businesses. While it is reasonable to expect new taxis to be fully accessible, it would, I believe, be unreasonable to require someone who had recently purchased and licensed a new non-accessible vehicle to dispose of it prematurely. Subsections (2) and (3) therefore provide that, where a non-accessible vehicle is already licensed as a taxi, it may be re-licensed as such. That does not mean that we should allow non-accessible vehicles to go on indefinitely. Subsection (4) provides for the Secretary of State to set an end date beyond which no non-accessible vehicle can be re-licensed. That date will only be set after full consultation with the trade.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para11"></a>The Committee will be aware that there are a number of cities and towns which have already set dates by which all taxis must be accessible&#151;London, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Manchester. It is important, both to protect the investment already made by the trade in those areas and to safeguard the interests of disabled people, that there is no slippage from those dates. Subsection (5) provides for dates earlier than those set in regulations to be applied by orders made by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para12"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 95, it is in no one's interests&#151;least of all disabled people&#151;to see the trade reduced or destroyed. The Government believe that the effect of this Bill will in fact be to open up significant additional new markets to the trade. We have <P>


<a name="column_2037"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2037</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nonetheless listened carefully to the trade and taken full note of its anxieties. We therefore intend to make regulations that will enable the Secretary of State to grant an order exempting an authority from the requirements that I have outlined, provided a number of clear criteria are met. Those are, first, that because of the specific circumstances of an area it would be inappropriate to impose the requirements and that to do so would result in an unacceptable reduction in the number of taxis in an area. The legislation will put the onus on any authority wishing to apply for such an exemption to carry out appropriate consultation with all sections of the local community (including, as a matter of course, disabled people and the taxi trade), to publish and make known their proposals and to consider representations made before making their application. Once the application has been made, the Secretary of State must consult his statutory advisers, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. He may then grant or refuse the exemption on the basis of the application, subject to such terms and conditions as he thinks fit.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para13"></a>This clause is a recognition of the enormously wide variations in types of area and of taxi use in this country, from a densely populated urban area with a substantial transitory as well as resident population to a very rural area where the taxi driver may in many cases be part-time.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para14"></a>The strong presumption must be that, whatever the area, there will be now, or may be in the future, disabled people whose mobility would be enhanced by the availability of accessible vehicles. We must recognise and allow for the possibility, however, that the requirements set out in these clauses could jeopardise the viability of the trade in a particular area to the point at which there ceased to be taxi provision for anyone. That is not our intention.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para15"></a>In Amendment No. 96, it is one thing to provide for taxis to be designed or adapted to be able to carry a passenger in a wheelchair but we need also to ensure that the drivers of those vehicles are then required to convey those passengers. The new clause, Amendment No. 96, sets out the duties which will apply to drivers of regulated taxis when they are hired by a disabled person. These duties not only extend to the carriage of disabled persons, but also to the manner in which those persons should be carried. Any driver who fails to comply with these duties will be guilty of an offence.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para16"></a>For those drivers who are concerned that all of this will be a burden on taxi drivers, let me assure them that there is protection. For example, we are not proposing that the driver should be required to carry someone who is disabled in circumstances when he would not legally be required to carry any other passenger.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para17"></a>We have also made provision for a licensing authority to exempt a taxi driver from these duties on either medical grounds or on the ground that his physical condition makes it impossible or unreasonably difficult for him to comply with these duties. This provision is particularly important in ensuring that we do not discriminate against any disabled driver who wants to work as a taxi driver and who otherwise fulfils the <P>


<a name="column_2038"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2038</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>criteria for that type of employment. We do not, of course, want this exemption provision to be abused and so we have provided a number of safeguards to that end.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para18"></a>In Amendment No. 97 we are concerned not only with the needs of wheelchair users but, just as importantly, with the needs of other disabled people, including those with sensory impairments. There have been reports from across the country that blind and partially sighted people have been refused access to taxis because they are accompanied by a guide dog. The same discrimination is faced by people who use hearing dogs. Refusal may be justified where the driver has a medical condition which is aggravated by dogs&#151;for example, some form of asthma&#151;but for the most part there can be no justification for a taxi driver refusing to carry someone with a guide or hearing dog in circumstances when he would otherwise take other passengers.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para19"></a>This clause deals with such practice by imposing duties on taxi drivers to convey a disabled person accompanied by a guide dog or hearing dog. It will affect all taxi drivers, not only those who drive regulated taxis. Drivers will have a duty to carry the passenger's guide dog or hearing dog and to allow it to remain with the passenger. The driver will not be allowed to make an additional charge for carrying the dog in his taxi. Where a driver fails to comply he will be guilty of an offence. There will be provision for licensing authorities to exempt taxi drivers on medical grounds&#151;for example, they may be allergic to dogs&#151;and to issue them with exemption certificates.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para20"></a>On Amendment No. 98, I have already mentioned that under Clauses 22G and 22H it will be possible for licensing authorities to issue exemption certificates to drivers and exemption notices for display in the taxis concerned to the effect that the named driver is exempt from the duties imposed by those clauses. The purpose of the new clause is to safeguard against the possibility of forgery and the fraudulent use of these certificates and notices.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para21"></a>In Amendment No. 99 we have the legislative provision governing taxis in Scotland which is to be contained in the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982&#151;an Act which I remember well in its passage through another place. The framework of the Act is such that this one short clause will enable the taxi provisions in the Bill in respect of England and Wales to be introduced for disabled people in Scotland by means of regulations.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para22"></a>Amendments Nos. 143 and 147 are simply provided to cover the definitions of the additional terms "accessibility regulations", "licensing authority" and "taxi" introduced under the principal amendments, Amendments Nos. 93 to 98.
<P>

<a name="50615-36_para23"></a>I hope that I have explained, if at a little length, the purpose of the amendments and new clauses that I am introducing which arise as a result of undertakings given in another place. I beg to move.

<A NAME="50615-37_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gladwin of Clee: </B>   The proposals have received a somewhat lukewarm welcome from the taxi trade and organisations representing taxi drivers. They are not convinced of the practicality of the proposals and are <P>


<a name="column_2039"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2039</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concerned about the cost to them of the adaptations that will be required to provide disabled access to their vehicles. To a large extent, the trade is composed of single-owner drivers. If all licensing authorities required all taxis to be wheelchair accessible, the trade would be decimated in many provincial areas. I understand and appreciate that that is not the Government's intention, but there will be pressures on licensing authorities to require at least a percentage of taxis to be wheelchair accessible. The risk is that a number of owner-drivers would defect to the private hire sector which, of course, is not covered by this legislation.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para0"></a>For a number of disabled people, a taxi is their primary and, in some cases, only means of transport. It would therefore be tragic if, as a result of this legislation, the availability of taxis was to be curtailed. In order to allay the anxieties felt by the trade, can the Minister say whether the Government will consider the following? First, as wheelchair-accessible taxis or taxis with swivel seats will become the disabled person's public service vehicle, should not they be treated in the same way as other public service vehicles&#151;that is, as far as the level of value added tax is concerned and the rebate on fuel excise duty?
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para1"></a>Secondly, could regulations be issued requiring local authorities to introduce taxi-card schemes? Thirdly, will the Government think about including the private hire sector in this legislation? While there is a clear legal distinction between taxis and private hire vehicles, outside London there is considerable operational overlap. Taxis are often saloon cars, indistinguishable from those operated by private hire companies. Bookings of private hire vehicles are often made in exactly the same way as for taxis, by telephone for immediate use, and that is the way that severely disabled people and wheelchair users get their transport.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para2"></a>It seems illogical to licensed taxi drivers that the private hire sector should have no responsibility for providing disabled access to their vehicles, particularly when I understand that the Government envisage that private hire companies will be granted sole concessions at stations and airports. I am told that, for instance, unless you order a taxi with wheelchair access in advance, you cannot get one off the rank at Gatwick because a private hire company has the sole concession. That position will not change in the future because private hire vehicles are not included in the legislation.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para3"></a>When introducing the amendments, the Minister referred to consultation with the taxi trade. Perhaps I may ask him for an assurance that there will be consultation with the organisations that represent taxi drivers. I should be grateful if the Minister could comment either now or at a later stage on some of the concerns that I have raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   I have already ensured that the Minister should have in front of him a list of objections to&#151;or rather, questions about&#151;these amendments. The questions have been raised by my noble friend Lord Winchilsea and Nottingham, who cannot be present. They are questions which have been raised about these amendments by taxi operators. They sound sensible to <P>


<a name="column_2040"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2040</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>me, but the people operating the service have questions and concerns. It would be helpful to the Committee if we had answers to those questions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-37_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   On these Benches broadly speaking we welcome the Government's proposals. About 4.5 million people have a mobility problem and 500,000 people are wheelchair users. In London, as we all know, we have the two extremes. We have hackney carriages (the black taxis) licensed by the police, which have ramps for wheelchair access until, as the taxi drivers tell us, they are awfully sorry, but they have been stolen. In London we also have private hire cars&#151;the minicabs&#151;which are unlicensed, unregulated, inaccessible and too often unsafe. In other words, in London we have the extremes.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para4"></a>Outside London there are no such extremes. We have hackney carriages which, especially in the cities, are increasingly black taxis, but they can be saloon cars, which may be preferable in rural areas where one travels long distances. We have also private hire cars which are almost always saloon cars. But unlike London, as my noble friend Lord Gladwin said, because both are licensed and regulated by the local authority, the safety of the car and the character of the driver are checked. So there is considerable overlap between the two services.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para5"></a>The problems inside and outside London are very different. Inside London, black taxis are safe and accessible. Minicabs are neither, but should be. Outside London, hackney carriages and private hire cars are safe but both may be inaccessible. They should be accessible.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para6"></a>The Government's amendments, which recognise the difference between London, the cities, suburban areas and rural areas, are welcome, but I believe that the Minister has some questions put to him by my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Addington, which need to be answered. Until my noble friend talked about Gatwick and the minicab concession and the fact that an integral part of public transport would be outside the requirements of public transport accessibility, I was not aware that the problem existed. The Minister must come back, if he will, with some ways of solving that problem.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para7"></a>As the amendments stand, we welcome the phasing in for existing operators. We welcome the agreement that, in rural areas especially, swivel seats in a saloon car may be more appropriate than running a black FX cab, although it should perhaps be remembered that the driver of a saloon car with a swivel seat may have to lift someone from a wheelchair into that swivel seat. At 16 stone, a disabled person may be too heavy for a driver. I recognise that the Minister has emphasised that taxi drivers who are themselves disabled will have some protection, but we are getting into difficult areas in which protection for the taxi driver is to some extent bought at the expense of rights of access for the disabled user. There are no easy solutions, and clearly there must be consultation. We share the Minister's concern that this is a very difficult area.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para8"></a>Of those disabled people who prefer black cabs, some 30 per cent. say that they could not manage a saloon car, whereas of those who prefer a saloon car, only 3 per cent. could not manage a black cab. So it is clearly right to impose accessibility on hackney carriages. Any <P>


<a name="column_2041"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2041</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>customer who prefers a saloon car can always hire one by telephone. As my noble friend Lord Gladwin said, it may be right to expect government assistance to make hackney carriages more physically accessible.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para9"></a>I realise that there are difficulties, especially as the trade is seeking to maintain a distinction between hackney carriages and private hire cars. I respect those views. I realise that outside London many hackney carriage drivers with saloon cars do not want a black FX imposed upon them as new ones cost about &#163;24,000. Even secondhand ones&#151;a Metro, for example&#151;cost between &#163;8,000 and &#163;10,000. Having a black taxi cab often stops the private owner using it for private purposes when not plying for trade.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para10"></a>In my city some 10 years ago, we required all hackney carriages to become black taxis within 10 years as they were replaced. There was huge resistance from the taxi trade and a number of insults were thrown around the place. Now virtually all licensed hackney carriage drivers are delighted with the change. The reason is that when the Government deregulated the quota system for hackney carriages at places such as railway stations anyone could then buy a plate. It was not limited by the local authority estimate of the trade available. That meant that many people came in and bought a plate in order to skim off the cream of the trade in the few weeks preceding Christmas.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para11"></a>However, by requiring all hackney carriage plate drivers to drive an FX we have kept out the cowboys. The trade has been "professionalised" and the existing hackney carriage drivers have substantially benefited. Most of them now welcome the change that we imposed on them, although they resisted it furiously at the time. Of course, local people retain the choice between black cabs and private saloon cars and they wish that choice to remain.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para12"></a>Perhaps I may make an additional point that has not been mentioned&#151;the need to train the taxi drivers who will be required to have vehicles which are fully accessible. Too many taxi drivers are rough, quick and impatient with disabled people. They do not know how to handle them, in an almost literal sense. Even the best intentioned face a dilemma: the longer they take and the more careful they are, the more the meter ticks up, the more the fare rises and the more displeased the disabled person will be.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para13"></a>Those are the dilemmas and the Government are doing their best to tackle them. We all accept they they are delicate and difficult issues. However, we broadly welcome the amendments. We welcome the phasing, the exemptions, the timing, the flexibility and the promise to consult. We hope that with these amendments hackney carriages will become what they should become&#151;a recognised part of public transport, networking disabled people with able-bodied people and with full access. We support the amendments.

<A NAME="50615-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I listened carefully to the noble Baroness and was most interested in what she said. <P>


<a name="column_2042"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2042</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, I believe that her conclusion is inconsistent with her earlier arguments. We shall have a chance of considering that further at the Report stage.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para14"></a>I have no objection to the new clauses under Amendments Nos. 97, 98 and 99. However, those in Amendments Nos. 93 to 96 inclusive worry me a great deal. What worries me most is that they appear to be in conflict with what was said by my noble friend Lord Mackay in reply to the debate on Second Reading. Several Members had raised the issue of taxis and accessibility to them. My noble friend said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I can assure the House that there is no intention to require every new taxi to be purpose built; nor do we intend to subject taxis to all the requirements in Part III of the Bill on service providers to make reasonable modifications. I can also assure the House that, in framing the new access standards, the Government will be mindful of the problems facing taxi operators in rural areas. Coming from the West Highlands as I do, I am well aware of such difficulties".&#151;[Official Report, 22/5/95; col. 890.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para15"></a>It is good to hear my noble friend express such understanding.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para16"></a>What worries me is that because of the power being taken to lay down certain standards to achieve uniformity and, in particular under Amendment No. 96 wheelchair accessibility, we would be creating inflexibility. From correspondence and conversation which I have had with the Minister concerned, Mr. Steven Norris, I understand that the Government will use those new clauses in such a way as to ensure that at some future date all licensed taxis outside of London, like those in London, will have to be wheelchair accessible unless exemptions are granted. If that were so, it would be contrary not only to the interests of taxi operators, as the noble Lord, Lord Gladwin, said and the noble Baroness rather suggested, but contrary to the interests of disabled people, who require all kinds of taxis to be available to them. Of course, it would also be against the interests of the public in general if we imposed obligations upon the taxi trade which led to there being fewer taxis outside London. That would be very unfortunate.
<P>

<a name="50615-37_para17"></a>I do not have the facts and figures, but my information is that in East Anglia a number of taxi businesses have gone out of operation, and that was without anything of this kind happening. Therefore, we must be very careful about imposing obligations on the taxi trade, not only, as I have said, in its own interests but also in the interests of disabled people and the public in general.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   The noble Lord said that a number of taxi businesses in East Anglia are no longer functioning. I am sure that that may be true, because quite a lot of them have been under-cut by extra vehicles in the trade. It must be said that driving is the last resort for unemployed men. When hackney carriage plates became deregulated, it was very easy to move into the taxi trade and under-cut those already in it. Has the number of taxis, as opposed to the number of taxi businesses, reduced?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I can only go on what I have been told. I am sorry that I do not have the statistics, but I have no reason to mistrust those who have informed me. Indeed, I know that in Huntingdon it is abundantly clear <P>


<a name="column_2043"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2043</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that there are now roughly two-thirds the number of taxis that there were about 10 years ago. I give that as an example within my knowledge.
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para0"></a>It will be for the licensing committees of councils outside London to decide whether to grant or refuse taxi cab licences. In doing so, they would have to comply with what is laid down in the regulations. It is regrettable that the Bill does not provide for the licensing authorities to have immediate power to grant exemptions. They are not allowed to grant exemptions unless regulations are made, under Amendment No. 95, by the Secretary of State and he, in making those regulations, cannot do so generally. He can do so only:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for the purpose of enabling any relevant licensing authority to apply to him for an order (an 'exemption order') exempting the authority from the requirements of section (New licences conditional on compliance with accessibility regulations)".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para1"></a>There are times, perhaps, when the gentleman in Whitehall knows best, but I think that that is a rather out-moded view. If I may say so, I believe that it would be far better for my noble friend the Minister not to move the amendments, especially the one from which I just quoted. The Government could then consider what has been said tonight and make sure that the undertaking that was given on Second Reading is really fulfilled. That would ensure that we do not lack that flexibility&#151;that variety of offer of service&#151;which is so necessary for disabled people.
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para2"></a>One could go on to talk about the subject for a very long time; indeed, I have a file of correspondence on the matter three inches thick which I have received over the past 18 months. I have no interest in the taxi trade, but because of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, and I did under the 1985 Act when we introduced some provisions that both sides found acceptable, which ensured that the taxi trade would be fairly treated, the latter has seemed to lean on me ever since. Of course, I have been happy for the trade to do so, but, in this case, I must look to the interests of disabled people, including my own daughter. Therefore, I wish I could persuade my noble friend Lord Mackay not to move Amendments Nos. 93 to 96. It would be far better&#151;indeed, it would save paper, time and much trouble&#151;if he could introduce fresh amendments on Report modifying the current amendments in the light of the views expressed by the noble Baroness and other Members of the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Templeman: </B>   I, too, have had representations made to me although I have no personal interest in the taxi trade. Those representations have not been made by the unemployed or people who throw disabled persons out of taxis; they have been made by long-standing taxi drivers who have large mortgages, large hire-purchase debts in relation to their cars, children at local schools and have experienced a depression over the past four years. On their behalf I would say that, notwithstanding the honeyed words of the Minister, their fears are that the effect of the amendments would be that everyone would have to buy a black taxi, which costs &#163;24,000. Any other modifications would cost the same. Certainly, a London taxi would cost &#163;24,000. That is the figure that I have been given. Therefore, taxi drivers believe that they would be faced with the choice of either paying &#163;24,000 for a taxi or going out of business. I see that the noble Baroness wishes to intervene. I give way.
<P>


<a name="column_2044"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-38_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am much obliged. The noble and learned Lord is certainly right about the cost of a new London taxi; but, as far as I am aware, most of the black taxis used outside London are second-hand vehicles the going price of which is between &#163;8,000 and &#163;9,000. Further, I should point out that the amendments would not stipulate black taxis as the only way of holding a Hackney Carriage plate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Templeman: </B>   In theory the amendments would not do so; but, in practice, there will only be one taxi that fulfils the requirements and that will be the black taxi which, notwithstanding its second-hand price, would cost &#163;24,000. Taxi drivers fear that they will either have to pay that sum or go out of business. That would be an onerous burden, but one which they ought to bear on behalf of the disabled if it were necessary and if it were wanted.
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para3"></a>However, the trade's point is that there are a large number of disabled persons who do not like taxis. I do not say so myself; indeed, I am very happy with taxis and use them all the time. Many people find that the black taxi is not suitable for their disablement and they prefer the other kind. But, instead of having a choice which is now the case, they will have no choice: it will be a black taxi or nothing throughout the country. That will apply in rural and suburban areas and, even down in Bodmin, we shall be seeing fleets of black taxis, subject to the exemption power which is very limited. It depends on the local authority and is very limited because the Minister wants to produce that effect.
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para4"></a>I merely made the point that that is the effect that the trade believes will be produced and that, far from giving more choice to the disabled, it will give them less. Those are the fears of the trade.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-38_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Darcy (de Knayth): </B>   I had not intended to intervene, but perhaps as a wheelchair user I could just say how much it has absolutely revolutionised my life and the lives of other wheelchair users to have the accessible black taxi. It makes all the difference having a larger proportion of them available already, because when they were originally introduced one had to give three days' notice if one wanted to take a taxi. Now one can be fairly sure of getting one on the street, but it would be a lot more useful to know that if one hailed a taxi it was accessible and, of course, one would get more and more wheelchair users using them if they knew they could get them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-38_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   I hope I may raise a concern that I have with particular reference to Amendment No. 95, whose rubric states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Exemption from accessibility regulations".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para5"></a>Over most of the country we shall have&#151;over possibly a little period of time&#151;accessible taxis, and disabled people will get used to those, and as the noble Baroness has said, it will revolutionise their lives, as it has revolutionised lives where such taxis already exist within local areas. However, what may be applicable and understood as a sort of mechanism for local provision is all very well&#151;the implication of Amendment No. 95 is that in certain areas there will be certain conditions&#151;but we are talking about national legislation which should apply nationally. I would hope that we would arrive, over <P>


<a name="column_2045"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2045</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time, at a situation where a disabled person can leave London and go to any part of the country and know that he or she can get an accessible taxi without any fuss or bother, as can be done in London, Manchester and other major cities.
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para6"></a>The concern I have about Amendment No. 95 is that it gives no timescale. I think what may be necessary here is a transitional timescale&#151;it could be five or 10 years&#151;which states that after this transitional period the taxis will be fully accessible. I am concerned also that we should recognise that in certain areas there will be financial difficulties. There are depressed areas, particularly some rural areas, where the trade may not be very strong and where, historically, there has not been a provision. We need to consider how we get over the economic problems of the trade to ensure that the trade is not forced into decline, but that at the same time provision is made that conforms to a national pattern which does not effectively result in some areas of the country being almost no-go areas for disabled people, or where it is more difficult for disabled people to get this provision so effectively disabled people are discriminated against in some areas. I think concern has been expressed in a number of areas about these amendments. It is the first time we have seen them and I hope that the Minister will be able to take on board some of the concerns that have been raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-38_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Stedman: </B>   I support the amendments and I appreciate the fact that the Government have put them down and that we are getting somewhere with taxis for disabled people. The door-to-door public transport which taxis provide is particularly important for disabled people to enable them to get from where they are to where they want to go. I believe there has been a real misunderstanding of the Government's intention. My reading of the new clause is certainly not the same as that of my noble and learned friend Lord Templeman because, as I see it, it does not involve the complete replacement of a fleet of private saloon cars by vehicles accessible to passengers in wheelchairs.
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para7"></a>Much has been made of the problems in rural areas and, as I understand it, outside London it is proposed that all the hackney cabs should be capable of meeting the needs of all customers, including those who use wheelchairs and those who are ambulant but disabled. This does not mean that all the taxi drivers must have London style taxis. Indeed I understand that the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, the advisory committee to the Minister, is already working out and sorting out specifications for suitable vehicles, perhaps even better than the ones that are on the market now.
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para8"></a>There has to be a range of vehicles which can provide suitable access for all disabled people. The private hire vehicles will still be available for those who need or prefer to use a saloon car. Indeed, I am told that there are twice as many private hire vehicles in service as there are hackney cabs. I believe that the new proposals take account of the interests of people with disabilities, whatever that disability may be, without any discrimination.
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para9"></a>When it comes to engaging a personal vehicle to take one on a journey, personal preference for a saloon car will continue to be met in full in future. People who have to travel in wheelchairs need a vehicle of the dimensions <P>


<a name="column_2046"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2046</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which will accommodate them. That is not one of the standard saloon cars. Their needs have not been met in full under the existing arrangements. So they are still, to some extent, victims of discrimination. The proposals before us will change all that and put an end to such discrimination.
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para10"></a>I hate to mention East Anglia again but my city of Peterborough has done the same as the city of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. We have black cabs on our ranks now. There was almost a riot when the city council set a time limit by which they had to be introduced, but I do not believe that one of those drivers would now go back to a saloon car.
<P>

<a name="50615-38_para11"></a>The changes will not happen overnight. We are not placing an undue strain on the taxi trade. No one expects new accessible vehicles to be on the roads, in the hands of all taxi drivers, on the day after the Bill receives Royal Assent. I hope that we are reasonable creatures. I believe that the Government have been reasonable. We hope that in due course we shall be able to look back and say that when we brought in this legislation it was one of the best things we did for disabled people in this country. I support the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I wonder whether the noble Baroness appreciates that it is the clear intention, as expressed to me, that under the proposed regulations all taxis shall be made accessible to wheelchairs. The only other vehicles the public will be able to obtain which are wheelchair accessible, supposing they and even disabled people want as much room in a vehicle as possible for passengers, are private hire cars. Private hire cars have no obligation to wait at taxi ranks, mainly at stations where taxis are so valuable. Therefore a rigidity will result from the regulations of which the noble Baroness has spoken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-39_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Stedman: </B>   In many cities taxi ranks are normally adjacent to a depot or place where one can call for a private hire saloon car if one wants one. In rural areas, if there is no need for them and the local authorities are satisfied that there is a sufficiently mixed fleet to do the job that is necessary, they can recommend to the Minister that they have a remission from doing that job, and they will receive a certificate of exemption.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   We have had an interesting debate. It is impressive that Members of the Committee who would have wished long since to have been in taxis on their way home have decided to wait and debate this issue.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para0"></a>I find myself in a rather unusual position in that the Opposition support me on this amendment. As a normal rule of thumb, if the Opposition support me I wonder if I am right. In this case I think that I am right. I was relieved when eventually the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, made some gentle criticisms of the amendments I have put forward. My faith in my rule of thumb was re-established.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para1"></a>Perhaps I may deal with a number of the points which have been raised. The noble Lord, Lord Gladwin of Clee, suggested some budgetary concessions. He will not be surprised when I tell him that those are matters for my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I shall go no further this evening.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para2"></a>On the question of putting pressure on local authorities to introduce the taxi card scheme, the taxi working group of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee <P>


<a name="column_2047"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2047</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is drawing up guidelines for local authorities on taxi card schemes. Those guidelines will provide local authorities with valuable information about the operation of such schemes. They will be issued to every local authority in the next month or two.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para3"></a>The noble Lord raised a problem regarding Gatwick. I understand that Gatwick is unusual in having a private hire concession. However, there is nothing to stop private hire firms at Gatwick having accessible vehicles. In practice, wheelchair accessible taxis are available from Crawley after a short delay.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para4"></a>The noble Lord reminded me of an irritation at Glasgow Airport. Because two local authorities operate a most amazing system&#151;both authorities of the party opposite, I may say&#151;you can have a black cab if you travel from Glasgow to the airport, but if you travel from the airport back to Glasgow you cannot have a black cab. You must take a saloon car type licensed by Renfrew District Council. It seems the most amazing situation. But never mind. That is part and parcel of the restrictions which many people seem so happy to have in this trade.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-39_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I believe that the Minister accepts the point so well made by my noble friend Lord Gladwin of Clee about private hire cars having a monopoly of a public transport place, as appears to be the case at Gatwick, if one regards taxis as public transport. In place of those taxis we have private hire cars. The Minister has an obligation to tell the Committee how in that situation the needs of disabled people will be more adequately met.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para5"></a>I do not believe that what he said regarding Crawley is good enough. Whether the answer is a mixed fleet, given the experience of authorities in Stockton and so on, I am not sure. However, he must find a better answer than the reply he gave about Gatwick. Otherwise, we shall harry him about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am happy to talk to the British Airports Authority about the situation if the noble Baroness will promise to talk to her colleagues, the socialists on Renfrew District Council, about the monopoly that they have allowed on their taxi ranks outside Glasgow Airport. There is a bargain! I suspect that I may have success more quickly than the noble Baroness will have with Renfrew District Council.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-39_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Gladwin of Clee: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that response. However, my reference to Gatwick was as an example. I understand that the Government envisage that private hire will gain sole concession at airports and railway stations. That is my understanding of a proposal made by the Government some months ago. I cited Gatwick as an example where that is occurring.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-39_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am not sure that I can answer that point at this time of night. I sought to answer it in relation to Gatwick. I recognise that there are some problems. I was not aware of that issue, but I promise that I shall draw the matter to the attention of my right honourable and honourable friends and perhaps discuss the matter with the British Airports Authority.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para6"></a>Perhaps I may respond to questions raised by a number of Members of the Committee but referred to in the round by the noble Lord, Lord Addington. Our policy has the <P>


<a name="column_2048"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2048</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>full support of our disability advisers, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, which is representative of a wide range of disability interests. I wish to stress again that we are not talking about taxis which are suitable only for wheelchair users&#151;a criticism which has been levelled at the current design of the purpose built London-type taxis. As I said, we are talking about making taxis available for all disabled people.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para7"></a>We envisage that the regulations will cover a wide range of design features to meet the needs of the population as a whole, including the elderly and disabled people with every kind of mobility difficulty. We shall consult fully on the detail of regulations. There are design possibilities coming in, I gather, which could indeed provide an answer to some of the problems in rural areas for a car that is perhaps less of a taxi and more of an ordinary motor car.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para8"></a>The suggestion that we propose to eliminate freedom of choice between saloon cars and wheelchair accessible cars is not correct. The taxi trade works on the cab rank principle. The person at the head of the queue takes the first cab on the rank. Members of the Committee will know that any attempt to go to the nearest taxi, even if the most convenient and on a pouring wet night, is usually not totally appreciated by the taxi driver at that moment at the head of the queue. So there is difficulty if one picks and chooses. Where there is choice&#151;and we do not wish to eliminate it&#151;it is in the pre-booked part of the system. We believe that there the saloon car system will continue to exist.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para9"></a>I said at Second Reading that it was our clear intention not to require all taxis to be purpose built. Nothing has changed. Our only difficulty may be a matter of semantics. The aim of the proposals before us tonight is to set down design parameters for accessibility which can be met in a wide range of vehicles. Some may be designed from the drawing board as taxis, others may be adaptations of existing vehicles or vehicles that are beginning to appear. I am not the greatest car expert, but in my view some of the manufacturers are bringing forward rather odd-shaped vehicles with high backs and the like, which must be fairly readily capable of adaptation.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para10"></a>In either case, we are not talking about perpetuating and spreading the current design of the purpose-built London style taxis or forcing their adaptation on unwilling authorities, on the unwilling taxi drivers or unwilling consumers. I hope that that will help the noble and learned Lord, Lord Templeman.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para11"></a>I know that there is concern about the timescales and we have no intention of introducing requirements over such a period as would undermine the viability of the taxi trade. If it would help to clarify the point, I should be pleased to consider whether an amendment to specify timescales can be brought forward at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para12"></a>My noble friend Lord Renton is particularly interested in the matter and he mentioned his concern about Huntingdon and the West Highlands. I thought for a minute that I was surrounded by the East Anglian Mafia, as one Member of the Committee after another gave me examples from East Anglia. My noble friend knows that from my background in the West Highlands I appreciate what he is talking about. On islands where the taxi trade is important, the amount of traffic is pretty limited. We <P>


<a name="column_2049"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2049</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe that the licensing authorities are in the best position to know when they should apply to the Secretary of State for an exemption.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para13"></a>I would prefer the Committee to pass the amendments tonight rather than for me to accept my noble friend's suggestion. Obviously, as I always do, I shall reflect on the points made and draw them to the attention of my honourable friend the Minister responsible for local transport. I shall discuss with him the various matters raised by the Committee and if I feel there is the need for any fine-tuning or amendment, I shall be happy and more than willing to table it at Report stage. Any other Member of the Committee who feels that I do not see the situation correctly may also put down an amendment for that stage.
<P>

<a name="50615-39_para14"></a>There is a difficult balance to find and we would be foolish not to recognise that. It is easy to deal with it in the large cities but I understand and fully appreciate the difficulties in the rural areas and countryside. It is essential that we realise that taxis are an important part of everyone's transport. That includes transport for disabled persons. I therefore hope that the Committee will accept that we in the Government feel that we have a reasonable balance between the interests of disabled people and the taxi trade and of all taxi users. I therefore hope that the Committee will agree with me and accept the amendments.

(".&#151;(1) No licensing authority shall grant a licence ("a new licence") for a taxi to ply for hire in an area unless the vehicle conforms with those provisions of the accessibility regulations with which it will be required to conform if licensed.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a taxi if the licensing authority is renewing an existing licence for that taxi.

<P>
<A NAME="50615-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Swinfen </B>   moved Amendment No. 100:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
After Clause 22, insert the following new clause:
<center><b>("Duty of local authority to provide advice</B></center><br>
. It shall be the duty of local authorities to provide advice and assistance to providers of services with regard to their duties under section 15.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50615-41_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: This is the last opportunity this evening for my noble friend to accept an amendment, so I hope that he will take the opportunity. He has not done so so far on the Bill. The purpose of this amendment is to require local authorities to advise providers on access provision, probably via access officers.
<P>


<a name="column_2053"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2053</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-41_para1"></a>As the Committee knows, Clause 18 enables the Secretary of State to make arrangements for the provision of advice and assistance with a view to promoting the settlement of disputes arising from the Bill otherwise than by recourse to the courts. Access issues are one of the most fundamental causes and manifestations of discrimination against disabled people. The advice given to businesses and service providers in relation to the provision of access is therefore crucial in the elimination of such discrimination.
<P>

<a name="50615-41_para2"></a>Expert advice on the provision of accessible buildings is given, and has been given for many years, by access officers employed by local authorities. The Secretary of State for the Environment, in Circular 10/82 following the Disabled Persons Act 1981 stated that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"local authorities may consider it desirable that they should designate one of their staff as an 'access officer' to provide a single clearly identified point of contact on questions of access for disabled people".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-41_para3"></a>The first access officer was employed by Leicester City Council in 1981, and there are now over 140 access officers employed by English local authorities.
<P>

<a name="50615-41_para4"></a>The duties of an access officer vary from authority to authority to suit the specific circumstances of local need, but the fundamental aim is to promote an accessible built environment to ensure that disabled people are not denied the opportunity to participate fully in all aspects of life as a result of the poor design of our streets and buildings. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My noble friend is certainly keen on his pound of flesh&#151;especially after the very broad hint that we all gave him that taxis were uppermost in our minds.
<P>

<a name="50615-41_para5"></a>We recognise that service providers will need advice on the new requirements and how best to comply with the law. That is why we are committed to ensuring that information and advice on the right of access is available to service providers. We will ensure that information and guidance will be available well before the new right of access comes into force. There will be codes of practice offering practical advice on matters such as the duty concerning refusal to serve; the requirement to change practices, policies and procedures; the requirement to provide auxiliary aids and services, where this would facilitate access; and the duty to remove physical barriers to access.
<P>


<a name="column_2054"></a>

<B>15 Jun 1995 : Column 2054</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50615-41_para6"></a>It is that last duty that my noble friend mentioned in particular, and I am aware of the work of local authority access officers. I believe that my noble friend envisages that his amendment would extend that work to every local authority. While I acknowledge the valuable work done, I do not agree that this would be the best approach.
<P>

<a name="50615-41_para7"></a>We wish to ensure that there is a wealth of information and guidance available to help service providers comply with legislation. It will be crucial to allow service providers and traders to plan for the changes that they need to bring about if we are to take service providers with us in our aim of including disabled people in all areas of life. Indeed, the guidance&#151;and the certainty it will give service providers about their duties&#151;will help ensure that the right of access works as intended.
<P>

<a name="50615-41_para8"></a>The issue of improving access for disabled people is extremely complex. On the one hand we have the diversity of disability itself: different adjustments will be required to meet the needs of people with different impairments. On the other hand, service provision itself is immensely varied. We must consider what is needed to achieve access in such areas as retailing, leisure facilities, historic buildings (discussed earlier this evening), broadcasting and telecommunications, to name a few. Each type of service will need information and advice pertaining to its own concerns. We shall be seeking the input of experts in each field in drawing up guidance and codes of practice and we shall be keen for them to have a role in the advisory process too.
<P>

<a name="50615-41_para9"></a>My central point is that I believe that it would be unworkable to put a statutory duty on local authorities to provide such specialist advice in each of the areas of service provision. It would be unrealistic to expect local authorities to fulfil this role. With that explanation, I hope that my noble friend will be able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I shall withdraw the amendment, but I shall also consider what my noble friend has said. It is possible that I may come back at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Henley): </B>  I would like to express to the widows and family members of those who died the Government's deep regret and condolences for their loss.
<P>

<a name="50615w01_para1"></a>I have this afternoon placed in the Library of the House a summary of the findings of the inquiry into this tragic crash, which claimed the lives of 29 people. After an exhaustive inquiry into all the circumstances, the possibilities of major technical or structural failure, hostile action or electromagnetic interference with navigation equipment were eliminated as possible causes. On all the evidence, it was concluded that the cause of the accident was that the two pilots had wrongly continued to fly towards the Mull of Kintyre below a safe altitude in unsuitable weather conditions. This constituted a failure in their duty and regrettably, therefore, it was concluded that both pilots had been negligent.
<P>

<a name="50615w01_para2"></a>I confirm that the Ministry of Defence will pay compensation to the next of kin where this is due. Legal advice is that in the particular circumstances of this accident, the Government's legal liability to the passengers on board is limited by the terms of the 1967 Order (the Carriage of Air Acts (Application of Provisions) Order 1967), which derives from the relevant international conventions. The Government have, however, previously made clear their view that the limit of 100,000 Special Drawing Rights (approximately &#163;100,000) arising from these conventions is out of date. Accordingly, the Ministry of Defence will consider claims in this case above 100,000 SDR. In doing so, they will take account of the discussions already in progress within the civil airline industry about the right limit for airlines' liability. These discussions will inform, but not necessarily determine, the Government's decision on <P>

<P>
<UL>What progress has been made on the Government's response to last year's consultation on proposed nitrate vulnerable zones under the EC Nitrate Directive.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615w01_spmin3"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment   (Viscount Ullswater): </B>  On 25 May my right honourable friends the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for Wales and my honourable friend the Minister for Environment and Countryside issued our response to last year's consultation. As with the original consultation document, the response document was sent to farmers in parishes and communities containing a proposed nitrate vulnerable zone, and to other interested groups.
<P>

<a name="50615w01_para3"></a>A major purpose of the consultation was to confirm the accuracy of the proposed zones, using farmers' local knowledge, before their formal designation. Over 500 sets of written comments were received, in the main from farmers in the proposed zones, and in each case an individual response has been sent out. In addition, many points have been addressed directly at a local level by the National Rivers Authority and the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service.
<P>

<a name="50615w01_para4"></a>The response document indicated how the Government propose to proceed with designations in the light of comments received. In all, the proposed boundaries for 31 of the 72 zones have been altered and it is proposed that two small groundwater zones should be deferred for further consideration. Maps of the revised zones are available free from MAFF Regional Services Centres and WOAD divisional offices.
<P>

<a name="50615w01_para5"></a>As foreshadowed in last year's consultation document, we have set up an Independent Review Panel, chaired by Mr. Terence Etherton QC and assisted by Dr. Richard Downing and Mr. Alastair Allcock. The panel will assess whether the Government's published methodology has been correctly and consistently applied in drawing up boundaries in those cases where consultees are dissatisfied with the amended boundaries as set out in the response. In addition, because of the uniqueness of the proposed surface water zone at Nayland, we have asked the Independent Review Panel to consider the case for and against its designation.

<A NAME="50615w01_wqn7"></A><B> Lord Kennet </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is the role of the Royal Parks Review Group; what does it review; and whether it publishes any report.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50615w01_spmin5"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of National Heritage   (Viscount Astor): </B>  The Royal Parks Review Group was set up to consider and make recommendations on the role and use of the Royal Parks, whether they meet the needs of today and how they can meet the demands of the future. It takes as its starting point that the Royal Parks should be places where people can enjoy the open air. The group has regard for any statutory limits on the use of the parks in order that any recommended changes can be reconciled with traditional activities.
<P>

<a name="50615w01_para7"></a>The review group has published three reports. The first, on Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, was published in 1992. The second, on St James's Park, The Green Park, Regent's Park and Primrose Hill, was published in 1993. The third, on Greenwich Park, was published in 1995. A further report, on Bushy Park and Richmond Park, is expected to be published later this year. Each report is discussed at a public conference before the recommendations are made to Ministers.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<UL>Whether the terms of reference given to the consultants charged by the Royal Parks Agency with enquiring into the demand for more services and developments within the Royal Parks were discussed with the various amenity societies representing users and neighbours of the Royal Parks; and if so, whether the views of the societies were taken into account; and
<P>
Whether the terms of reference given to the consultants charged by the Royal Parks Agency with enquiring into the demand for more services and developments within the Royal Parks were discussed with the expert group chaired by Dame Jennifer Jenkins which is engaged in reporting on the Royal Parks; and if so, whether the group's views were taken into account; and
<P>
What are the terms of reference which have been given to the consultants charged by the Royal Parks Agency with enquiring into the demand for more services and developments within the Royal Parks; and what is the cost of the exercise.

<A NAME="50615w02_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Responsibility for the subject has been delegated to the Royal Parks Agency under its Chief Executive, David Welch. I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given.
<P>

<a name="50615w02_para0"></a>Letter to Lord Kennet from the Chief Executive of the Royal Parks Agency, Mr. David Welch:
<P>

<a name="50615w02_para1"></a>I have been asked by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for National Heritage to reply to your questions concerning the consultants commissioned by the agency to enquire into the demand for more services and developments within the Royal Parks.
<P>

<a name="50615w02_para2"></a>The terms of reference given to the consultants were to carry out a three-year study, commencing in 1994, to determine who uses the Royal Parks, satisfaction with the facilities provided and how the parks ought to be improved to give greater pleasure and widen the range of people visiting them. In the first year the consultants were required to obtain and evaluate basic data on the number of visits to the parks, the type of people who visit them and the general satisfaction with the parks and the facilities provided. In the second and third years they are to corroborate the results from the first year of the study and also to carry our more qualitative research into visitors' attitudes and views. As advised in my letter of 14 March in response to your earlier question, the total cost of the contract will depend on the scope of the survey in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the second and third years, but is estimated not to exceed &#163;180,000.
<P>

<a name="50615w02_para3"></a>You asked whether the views of the Royal Parks Review Group were taken into account in developing the terms of reference. As stated in my subsequent letter of 3 April, the consultants were commissioned following a recommendation by the Review Group in its first report that market research should be carried out at regular intervals. In our brief to the consultants we also charged them to develop a suitable questionnaire, based on that used for the surveys conducted in 1992 in St James's, Green and The Regent's Parks and Primrose Hill, undertaken specifically for the group's review of those parks. In addition, we commissioned the consultants to develop and carry out additional and specific questions on Greenwich, Richmond and Bushy Parks in order that the results could be fed into the group's current review of these parks.
<P>

<a name="50615w02_para4"></a>You also queried whether the terms of reference were discussed with various amenity groups which have an interest in the Royal Parks and whether their views were taken into consideration. The amenity groups were advised of the forthcoming study, although they were not specifically asked to comment on the scope of the study. Their views have been taken into account, however, in drawing up the revised questionnaires for the second year of study.
