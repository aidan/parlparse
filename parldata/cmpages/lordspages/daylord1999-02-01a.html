<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Carlisle </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "90201-01_para0"></a>What steps they are taking to improve the morale of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="90201-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, Her Majesty's Government attach importance to maintaining and enhancing the morale of public servants. In the case of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, we believe that staff morale has benefited from the results of the comprehensive spending review, which will provide a 2 per cent. real terms increase in resources, allowing modernisation of the FCO's network of posts and IT systems. Morale should also be enhanced by other measures being taken to modernise the FCO, such as greater openness, improved personnel policies, more professionalism, and increased training.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Carlisle: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her comprehensive reply. I am grateful to hear her emphasise the word "openness". Is she aware that on 2nd June 1979 there was published in the Economist the valedictory dispatch of Sir Nicholas Henderson, our then Ambassador to Paris? In view of the fact that neither Britain nor the Foreign Office fell down as a result of that rather novel and unusual situation, does she agree that Ministers do not have the time, and sometimes do not have the inclination, to read the 212 valedictory dispatches from our embassies and legations that appear in the Foreign Office every three years? Will she therefore consider either having those dispatches or a selection of them printed or placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament so that the openness of the Foreign Office can be seen by all?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I can assure the noble Earl that I read all the dispatches that come into my box. I read them not only because I am a dutiful Minister, but also because they are highly informative, usually well-written and occasionally very funny. But they are also, without exception, very free and frank in their opinions and advice to Ministers about a whole range of issues, including their host countries. To release those dispatches in the way the noble Earl suggests would almost certainly result in some of those free and frank opinions perhaps on occasions being a <P>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1280</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>little harmful. I am bound to say that the overall effect would be for the dispatches to be much less free and frank and so defeat the purpose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Janner of Braunstone: </B>   My Lords, would not the best way to enhance the morale of those who work for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office be for us to thank them for the tremendous job that nearly all diplomats do, most of them in decent privacy and quiet, and especially for the help that they give people like myself who travel to those lands and whom they look after, brief and help beyond the call of their duties?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for those remarks. It is a pity that our newspapers and media try to focus on the negative. In fact, the Foreign Office receives many letters of thanks such as those just articulated by my noble friend from people who are helped abroad not only for the briefing given to eminent figures who are abroad but also for the completely unsung help, particularly from our consular divisions, given to people who find themselves in difficulties--people who may be in prison and so forth. I shall take great pleasure in conveying my noble friend's thanks to my colleagues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Mountgarret: </B>   My Lords, does not the noble Baroness agree that the morale of the Foreign Office might be greatly enhanced if the Foreign Secretary did not engage in antics which generate such adverse publicity?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the Foreign Secretary is an excellent Foreign Secretary. He is respected in the Foreign Office and we need no greater demonstration of how much he is respected by others than that he was the Foreign Secretary asked to be the emissary to Kosovo this weekend. We need say nothing more about the respect in which he is held.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say what progress has been made in addressing the systemic and cultural factors and the cumulative succession of failures of communication in the FCO which were identified by Sir Thomas Legg's important investigation last year?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the fact that the factors were suggested to be systemic and cultural suggests that they did not begin on 1st May 1997. As my right honourable friend pointed out on 27th July last year, we accepted every one of the recommendations in the Legg Report. They include a central unit for sanctions enforcement, new procedures for handling intelligence, guidance on contacts with private military companies, recruitment of professional managers in the administration and a greater exchange of staff with the private sector and NGOs. But the most important thing that has happened has been the CSR settlement and the prospect now of 200 new recruits in the Foreign Office who will be contributing to everything, including a new IT system which will help with communication.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that in large areas of the Foreign and <P>


<a name="column_1281"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1281</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Commonwealth Office morale appears to have been damaged by our effective cession of much of our foreign policy to 28 working groups in Brussels in which, of course, we have only a minority voice?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord should come to the Foreign Office and experience, as I do, how good morale is in most parts of the office. It has been enhanced by greater openness; by the holding of two open days in the past year and recruitment fairs; by inviting school children to visit the Foreign Office; by the commitment of the permanent under-secretary to racial equality; by a mentoring programme; and by many other measures. I simply do not recognise the lack of morale in those parts of the Foreign Office to which the noble Lord refers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the thanks which have been expressed to our diplomatic staff in posts overseas should be extended also to those in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office here in London who invariably answer queries from Members with great courtesy and alacrity? Will she also congratulate those concerned with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website which is an important development in greater openness and clarity of FCO policy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted to thank the noble Lord for pointing out that there is, of course, a strong diplomatic corps at home and to remind the House of the excellence of the Foreign Office website which, at the moment, receives 1 million visits each week. An enormous number of people look at that website. It is to the great credit of the Foreign Office that it is as well run as it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew13"></A><B> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein: </B>   My Lords, while echoing the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Janner, concerning the excellence of the Foreign Office and our diplomats abroad, which many of us have experienced, can the Minister say why it is not possible to publicise many of the success stories that the Foreign Office has had over the years? That would be extremely beneficial to all concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Viscount would like to put his points to the editors of our national newspapers and to those who edit the media, I am sure that we would all be interested in the response. There are some excellent success stories to tell of the Foreign Office, from foreign policy initiatives to those on openness and recruitment of young people from ethnic minorities. In the last DS9 competition, over 13 per cent. of those recruited were from ethnic minorities. That is an issue on which we have been pushing forward very hard in the past year. I am delighted that the noble Viscount has made such a point and, accordingly, I look forward to seeing his letter in The Times.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "90201-01_para1"></a>What progress has so far been made in the drafting of a new strategic concept for NATO.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="90201-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Gilbert): </B>  My Lords, work is still on course toward the adoption of an updated strategic concept for the alliance at the NATO summit in Washington in April. Discussions are based on a draft prepared by the NATO International Staff after a series of preliminary discussions among the 19 countries concerned. Her Majesty's Government continue to play a full part in the discussions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the NATO strategic concept document will refer to further enlargement of NATO, which would, of course, extend British security obligations further eastwards in Europe; that it will cover the European defence identity within NATO--one of the explicit commitments of the British Government; that it will thus affect the future of US/European relations and that it must also touch upon NATO commitment out of area, which implies British commitments in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Gulf? Given the central importance of such questions to defence policy, do Her Majesty's Government have any plans to consult the House on the document before it is finally agreed?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord will know, the discussions with respect to the updating of the strategic concept are being conducted in confidence. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on what will be in the final document, because it is still subject to negotiation. I should be surprised if none of the matters to which the noble Lord alludes is covered by the document. There are no plans at present to consult the House before the negotiations are completed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the Government will ensure that the new concept contains a provision that no NATO country will be the first to use nuclear weapons?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend always tries to seduce me down that path. I can do no better than repeat what I have just said to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace. It would be pointless for me to speculate at this stage on what will be in the strategic document.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carver: </B>   My Lords, in revising the strategic concept, will the Government do their best to encourage their fellow members of the alliance to ensure that, before there is any question of enlarging the alliance <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>further, the stark, uncompromising commitment of Article 5 of the Washington Treaty will be reconsidered?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, there are no plans of which I am aware to consider revising Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, or any other article of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord inform the House of the extent, if any, to which the European Commission has been involved in, or has been informed of, officially or unofficially, the content of the various drafts?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I am unaware of any consultations up to now involving the European Commission in such matters. I should be very surprised if it were involved at any stage in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind the success of the Strategic Defence Review, conducted by Her Majesty's Government over the past 18 months, will my noble friend suggest to our Government's colleagues in NATO that that model of public consultation not only with experts in the military establishment, but ranging much wider than that, would be beneficial in the construction of the new strategic concept for NATO?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I am obliged to my noble friend for his complimentary remarks about the way in which the Government conducted the recent Strategic Defence Review. However, I have to say that this is a consultation with respect to the new strategic concept for NATO, which is being conducted among 16 countries. Shortly, with any luck, three new adherents will be taking part in the final stages of the discussions. It would be inappropriate for us--indeed, quite futile--to try to impose on them at this late stage of the negotiations any method of proceeding other than the one in which we are currently engaged.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>friend say whether there are any other professions or occupations where members can escape disciplinary proceedings simply by retiring? Indeed, what justification can there be for such a situation? Further, will my noble friend take this opportunity to deprecate attempts which have been made by police sources to denigrate the Macpherson inquiry in advance of the publication of its findings?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I do not know of any other profession where a similar immunity, as it were, would arise following retirement. Certainly, if one has left regular practice at the Bar, one still remains liable to complaints from disenchanted members of the public. If there has been any concerted effort to interfere with, or pollute, the prospective findings of the report of Sir William Macpherson, I certainly deprecate them. I have known him for some years and he is a very considerable public servant carrying out a very difficult public duty. It would be best for all of us to wait and see what he has to say and then ponder it with very great care.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there is one other profession--if that is the right word for it--where one can escape the consequences of malfeasance, short of criminal actions, by retirement? It is the House of Commons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   That is so, my Lords, but they do not escape unscathed, because many of them end up here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, including me! However, does the Minister agree that a difficult transition has been taking place over the past few years from the old attitude of chief constables who automatically defended any policeman who was criticised to the present much better attitude of chief constables who openly investigate and root out those who fall short of the very high standards required? Surely this is essential for the maintenance of the justifiably high reputation of our police force in the world.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I believe that there has been a cultural change. I listened this morning to the broadcast on the radio of the interview with Deputy Assistant Commissioner Grieve. I do not think that anyone could suggest that he is not entirely alert and alive to such matters. However, it is true that there has been serious concern about the number of officers retiring on medical grounds. Fortunately the percentage fell from 50 per cent. of all retirements in 1994-95 to 36 per cent. for the year 1997-98. Indeed, we are looking to meet the target of not more than 33 per cent. by the year 1999-2000.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend the Minister agree that the investigation of murder is not an exact science? Indeed, I cannot think of one such inquiry in a decade in the CID which I can look back on and say that I would probably have carried <P>


<a name="column_1285"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1285</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it out in exactly the same way. Therefore, does my noble friend accept that any McCarthy-type witch-hunt of individual officers long after the event could risk injustice being heaped upon injustice? Does he further agree that to make sweeping generalisations about racism in the police service is to indulge in the very hallmark of stereotyping--the sign of racists themselves--which, in my belief, does grave injustice to all those hard-working, competent and honest police officers patrolling the streets day and night on our behalf?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, in my experience, the investigation of murders varies quite substantially. Some murders are extremely easy to investigate and solve--much easier than other types of crime. Some, as my noble friend indicated, are extremely difficult. When one gets a racist overtone, they may become even more difficult. I do not think that one wants McCarthyism, I do not think one wants assertion and I do not believe that one needs to pretend, or persuade oneself, that racism is not a serious problem in many different sections of our country. As I said, it would be best for us not to ponder on McCarthy but to wait for Macpherson. The inquiry which is being carried out is a most difficult one. There will be very significant long-term lessons for us all to heed and to try to learn from.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of the police disciplinary procedure and, more importantly, the inadequacy of the system on the basis that even the people who committed the murder have escaped justice? Will the noble Lord take into account the recommendation made by the Police Complaints Authority to the Home Affairs Committee that one way of dealing with this particular aspect would be to ensure that police officers, even if they retire on medical or other grounds, will still be subject to the disciplinary procedure up a period of four years after retirement? Alternatively, will the noble Lord take into account the view that no officer should be allowed to retire on health or other grounds if he or she is subject to a public complaint which is being investigated?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the report of the Home Affairs Committee is an admirable document; indeed, I believe that it was the first one under the chairmanship of Chris Mullin, who has laboured in this field for a very long time. The Home Secretary accepted those recommendations, some of which will require primary legislation. However, one needs to bear in mind the fact that in cases where a police officer is suspended by his chief constable during a disciplinary investigation, retirement cannot automatically take place.

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1286</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>retirement, can the Minister say what penalties would be thought appropriate to impose should guilt be established?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, plainly a certain range of penalties, which are available when an officer is serving, would no longer be available--for example, a reduction in rank or other such measures. It seems to me that we should wait to see what the report of Sir William Macpherson says, consider carefully the lessons to be learned, tie them in with the recommendations of the Home Affairs Committee and then take the matter forward. We must be fair to the overwhelming majority of police officers who are fair, honourable and decent. However, we also have to maintain public confidence, which has been very severely eroded following the racist murder of an innocent young man.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister think that the criminal standard of proof is appropriate in disciplinary proceedings when it is necessary to maintain the confidence of the public in the force, as he has outlined?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   No, my Lords. I am happy to reiterate what Jack Straw said. He believes that that is a significant disadvantage in the context of disciplinary inquiries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend the Minister aware of the situation with which the Greater Manchester Police Authority is now faced following the prosecution of one of its officers who was initially found guilty? The latter was successful on appeal and that has landed the police authority with a bill of &#163;10 million, which it has to pay out of its own resources. Does my noble friend realise the enormous cuts that will have to take place in Greater Manchester in order to fund that settlement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, if a police authority is sued in the civil courts and if it is found liable--or, as I understand has occurred in this case, wants to compromise the case--it seems to me only right and proper that the damages and the costs should be borne by the authority which has been found to be in default of its duties and obligations.

<FONT SIZE=3>Director General of Fair Trading. It is a matter for him how and when he makes his findings public. I understand that he is aiming to complete his investigation by the end of February.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, that means it will have taken the OFT a year to conduct an inquiry that it said originally did not need to take place. Is the Minister concerned that we are at a dangerous time when one piece of competition law is being phased out, with a rather lethargic regulator in charge, and a new piece of competition law is not to be implemented until March 2000? The Mirror Group is in play and we are assured by Andrew Neil that the Telegraph is still Mr. Murdoch's prime target. Is not the Minister worried that, without proper protection, the quality and diversity of our press are still under threat?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   No, my Lords. I think we have a vigorous law and a vigorous Director General of Fair Trading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree it is regrettable that the inquiry has taken a year? If a case of predatory pricing is established, those who have suffered as a result of that will have done so now for over a year, and if no such case is established, those who have been attacked for engaging in predatory pricing will have suffered those attacks for a year. This delay has been bad for the industry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   My Lords, as regards matters as complex as the one we are discussing, we all wish to ensure that investigations are sound and thorough. As noble Lords will be aware, there have been three or four similar investigations in the past, none of which has revealed sufficient evidence of any kind to bring a case. This series of investigations must be carried out thoroughly and well. I am sure the director general is doing that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree with me that the investigative powers of the Office of Fair Trading at the present time are inadequate, particularly as regards demanding information and accounts of all kinds? Does he further agree that when piloting the Competition Act through this House last year he sought to establish adequate provisions in the new law which would much enhance the existing position? Does my noble friend also agree that it would be desirable to implement at the earliest opportunity the investigative powers contained in the Competition Act of last year, even though full implementation may have to await the date which my noble friend has given in the past; namely, 1st March 2000?

<P>

<A NAME="90201-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that interesting contribution. It is true that the new Act introduces far more stringent powers of investigation. The Chamber thoroughly debated the matter. We set the date of 1st March 2000 for implementation of the Act largely to allow industry appropriate time for preparation. I believe that that date, <P>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1288</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which was chosen after much discussion in this House, is appropriate. As regards the investigation we are discussing, I say only that the length of the proceedings has been due in part to a request for further investigation and information which was made during the autumn, which was freely given by News International. That process will reach a swift conclusion in February.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that when he persuaded this House not to insist on the insertion of the predatory pricing clause in the Competition Act, he did so on the basis that the Office of Fair Trading would have the appropriate powers under the new Act to deal with the situation mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord McNally? Does he accept that as those powers do not come into effect until the year 2000 this issue will not go away?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his implied flattery as regards my powers of persuasion. However, the House decided with its own good sense that that was the appropriate way to take the Act forward. I believe we all agreed that this was a sensible interim period to enable the industry to prepare for the new regulations. As I say, I have no evidence that there is any shortage of capacity under the current legal system for the Director General of Fair Trading appropriately to carry out this investigation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, in view of the noble Lord's answers to previous questions, would it be helpful if the Director General of Fair Trading had greater resources to enable him to deal with these matters rather more speedily?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   My Lords, if I may say so, that is an appropriate suggestion. I believe that in the latest budgetary process an extra &#163;15 million has been dedicated to extending the capacity of the Office of Fair Trading over the next three-year budgetary period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm reports of an interview with Mr. Stephen Byers on the radio last night in which he said that although the Government wanted to see the removal of any political judgment with regard to most takeovers and mergers, the newspaper industry was a special case and that Ministers would wish to reserve powers to his department in cases of mergers and takeovers in the newspaper industry?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   My Lords, I must confess that yesterday evening I was close to Highbury for a particular event. I upheld the name which I am fortunate enough to bear while making a lot of noise about it. Therefore I have not caught up with the Secretary of State's latest statements. However, it was a perfectly satisfactory home win!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-03_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Before Clause 1, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Commencement conditional on compensation arrangements for contributors </B></center><BR>
(" .--(1) This Act (apart from this section) shall not come into force until the conditions set out in subsections (2) and (3) are satisfied.
<BR>
(2) The first condition is that the Department of Social Security guidelines on compensation are revised to ensure that no loss is suffered by any individual claimant, who has made contributions, as a consequence of the breakdown of the Contributions Agency computer.
<BR>
(3) The second condition is that all such compensation due has been paid.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-03_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment results from a series of debates we had during the debate on the social security uprating orders and at Committee and Report stages of the Bill. On the latter occasion we discussed a series of concerns expressed on all sides of the House as regards the situation which has arisen as a result of problems in connection with the computer system which monitors social security contributions. A number of people have not received payments to which they are entitled on the dates those payments were due.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-03_para3"></a>At Report stage the question arose of compensation. I pressed the Minister to clarify the position. It became apparent that the Government were proposing to compensate various people in the category I have just described and that various provisions had been made. However, it also emerged as a result of the debate that the compensation would be paid only on the basis of the existing departmental rules. In reply, the Minister said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there is no intention at the moment of which I am aware to depart from them".--[Official Report, 25/1/99; col. 810.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That gave rise to considerable cause for concern in that people entitled to a large amount of the money which had not been paid would receive compensation under the rules, but poorer people who were entitled to smaller amounts would apparently receive no compensation whatever. The amendment is intended to enable the rules to be amended to deal with the problem. That being so, I could spell out in considerable detail the arguments in favour of the amendment. However, I have heard a rumour that conceivably the Government are persuaded by the arguments that I advanced previously. <P>

<P>
<A NAME="90201-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Social Security   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  My Lords, with the leave of the House, as the noble Lord has invited me to speak to the issue now, that may be helpful rather than going through a long discussion and putting the government view at the end.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para0"></a>At Report stage we discussed compensation for those suffering delay through the problems with the NIRS2 system. Last week in another place the Public Accounts Committee also pressed the issue of compensation. I am now in a position to say how we intend to deal with this problem--a problem not of our making but one we inherited.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para1"></a>We fully accept that, whoever's fault the problem is, it was not caused by widows and pensioners. So we accept that they should suffer no loss. As I said on Report, we shall be paying arrears and, in that sense, there will be no loss. But we intend to go further. We intend to relax the current departmental guidelines which require a lengthy period of delay in payment and provide no compensation where the amount due is less than &#163;10. Because of the one-off nature of the NIRS2 problem we propose a one-off solution. In any payment system there are inevitable delays, such as where details need checking or where an address has changed. But where people have suffered unreasonable delay they will receive a minimum &#163;10 payment on top of the arrears. Those due larger amounts within the normal departmental guidelines will of course receive them. The compensation will be paid automatically where cases are reviewed. That will necessarily take time.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para2"></a>There are three reasons why I believe the House should reject the amendment proposed by the noble Lord in favour of the proposals I have just put forward. I am advised that the noble Lord's amendment is defective in two respects. First, the provision that his new clause makes for the commencement of the Bill is flatly inconsistent with the existing commencement provision in Clause 28, which your Lordships have already approved. Yet the noble Lord's amendment contains nothing to provide for the way in which the new clause is intended to work alongside Clause 28, or vice versa.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para3"></a>Secondly, the new clause is drafted in terms which are so vague that we doubt whether a court would be able to give effect to them in a way which would meet the noble Lord's objectives as he described them today. For instance, the whole provision is set in the context of an unspecific reference to "the contributions Agency computer", and it speaks in terms of a "breakdown". As I explained on Report, our present difficulties arise out of delayed introduction of a new system rather than any "breakdown". It is, moreover, unclear how the noble Lord's reference to a "loss" would be construed when there is no doubt that every customer will receive every penny of benefit to which they are entitled.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para4"></a>To put these deficiencies right we should need to amend the Bill in another place, so delaying the transfer. I am not trying to make a partisan point; often in <P>


<a name="column_1291"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1291</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opposition one moves a technically deficient amendment as one does not have the drafting skills that are available to government. That is merely by way of explanation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para5"></a>The noble Lord's amendment is unworkable. It means that the transfer could not happen until the last pensioner--in hospital, for example, for a hip replacement operation, or perhaps spending a month or so on the Costa del Sol or travelling around the world (that is, even if they were well off)--had been paid. In those cases it could take months to make the payment, hinging on one last pensioner who had not yet been tracked down. In the meantime employers would face uncertainty that they neither want nor need. The amendment also means that every individual compensation payment to some 300,000 people would need to be separately calculated--at huge administrative cost.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para6"></a>The substantive reason--the reason why I hope the House and the noble Lord will respond positively to the Government's proposals--is that the proposals are more generous than those put forward by the noble Lord as well as being more certain.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para7"></a>It may be helpful if I illustrate this by way of a couple of examples. Let us take the example of a pensioner underpaid by &#163;2.50 a week and a worst case scenario that it takes some 18 months to review the case. Under present departmental rules he or she would not receive any compensation. If we offered the 0.5 per cent. we are offering pension funds, as implied by the noble Lord's amendment, he or she would receive &#163;8.45 after a complicated manual calculation. Our proposals would offer &#163;10 after a very simple calculation. Another example would be that of a widow underpaid for nine months. Under the current rules she would receive nothing. Under the noble Lord's amendment she would receive &#163;2.25. Under our proposals she will receive &#163;10.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para8"></a>Our priority is now to catch up with as much of the outstanding work on NIRS2 as possible, particularly the remaining end-of-year returns from employers and contracted-out pension rebates, and to roll out the remaining areas of the system. Then we can start reviewing the backlog of cases affected. We shall be looking over the coming months at the detailed operation of the compensation arrangements so that we can get money to individuals as quickly and effectively as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para9"></a>The proposals I have announced today mean that the claim repeated today by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, that under our proposals the better-off are compensated but the less well off, because they are below a floor of compensation, are not, does not hold. The compensation we have announced today is more effective, more workable and more generous than that proposed in the noble Lord's amendment. Therefore, I hope that, given the spirit of this offer, the noble Lord will be able to withdraw his amendment and that the House will support the Government's proposal.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, perhaps I may raise one point. What she said is <P>


<a name="column_1292"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1292</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>most welcome. It is a considerable step forward. I am sorry to cavil on any aspect. However, this provision will be triggered only by "unreasonable delay". The noble Baroness gave no indication as to what "unreasonable delay" might be. Will she comment further?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the House will consent to my replying to that point. My reference was to delay caused by the NIRS2 computer; namely, delay in calculating the contributions record in the previous year. We were trying to avoid a situation whereby, because someone failed, for example, to give accurate information and the payments were therefore five or seven days late, that person would automatically qualify for the &#163;10 payment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, before my noble friend sits down, she has announced an imaginative and eminently decent response which will be welcomed by disabled people, retirement pensioners and widows alike. Almost by custom, Ministers receive more brickbats than bouquets. Will she accept my congratulations as well as my thanks?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I served my apprenticeship in the House of Commons under the late Iain Macleod. As I said previously, his remark when an amendment was accepted in principle was, "You don't shoot Santa Claus." By that, he meant that one does not go on at enormous length afterwards.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para10"></a>Nonetheless, there are one or two points that ought to be made. I do not feel gravely concerned about the technical deficiencies of my amendment. As the Minister has pointed out throughout our debates, this is a highly technical Bill--so much so that there are still two government amendments to come at this Third Reading stage. I appreciate the points made by the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para11"></a>We have been anxious throughout to ensure that this matter received rather more coverage and attention than it had previously received. Up to now, it has been very difficult indeed to get at the facts, although I pay tribute to the noble Baroness for the way in which she has responded. If I may say so without embarrassing her, her response has been much more satisfactory than was the response of the Secretary of State on the uprating Bill in the other place.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para12"></a>This matter presented a problem. I am still not clear on two points. Perhaps the Minister will say how many people will benefit from the concession that she has fortunately now announced. Secondly, what is the total cost likely to be?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para13"></a>As regards the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, am I right in thinking that all those who have suffered as a result of the delay in payments because of the computer problem will receive the minimum amount which the noble Baroness mentioned and, if they are entitled to more, will receive that under the normal rules? I have a vague feeling that one of the conditions normally applied is that the delay has to be for a certain period of time. It would be wrong in these circumstances to set a deadline of that kind. I presume that it will apply <P>


<a name="column_1293"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1293</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to all those whose payments have been delayed and have not received on time the benefit to which they are entitled.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para14"></a>The next point which I should be grateful if the noble Baroness would clarify is the position with regard to SERPS. What will the compensation arrangements be and how will they differ from the arrangements for those whose payments of national insurance pensions or other contributory benefits have been delayed?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para15"></a>Finally, a number of people affected are those who applied for payment of a pension to be deferred and paid on a certain date in order to obtain a higher rate of pension in perpetuity than they would otherwise have received. Presumably when such people are eventually paid their pension they will receive the full amount, the compensation which the noble Baroness mentioned and the recent uprating covered by the uprating orders. What I am not clear about is whether such people would have the option to receive either &#163;10 or--which is likely to be a much more valuable amount--the amount which they would have received if they had deferred the payment of their pension not to the date they originally suggested but to the date when it will, because of the Government's mistake, eventually be paid.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-04_para16"></a>Having said all that, I hope that those who have suffered because of this problem will feel that they have benefited as a result of our debates, the attention focused on this issue and the understanding which the noble Baroness has shown. What is important is how the Government have responded, not the origin of the computer problem itself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Pitkeathley: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I too may express my congratulations to the Government on dealing with this matter with such despatch. It is perhaps not easy for those of us with an adequate income or maybe an understanding bank manager to understand how difficult it can be for people who are completely dependent on benefits when there is a delay in payment of them. The speed with which this matter has been concluded is a matter for congratulation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the warm response from all sides of the House. I am delighted that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State felt able to respond to a matter which has been a concern for some time but which was highlighted at the Public Accounts Committee, as well as in debates in your Lordships' House. I am particularly grateful for the kind words of my noble friends and for the welcome from the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-05_para0"></a>Perhaps I may seek to answer some of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. The total numbers we are talking about are as follows. In the case of retirement pensioners, the figure is around 178,000. Many pensioners will already be receiving their full amount because it has been manually calculated or because they already have sufficient contributions, even without the last year, to float them off the need for that additional information. There are 163,000 people in SERPS affected, and they will be dealt with and paid in exactly the same way as those on RPs. In the case of <P>


<a name="column_1294"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1294</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>widow's benefit, there are something like 27,000 people affected. Up to about 27,000 people on incapacity benefit are affected. I say "up to" in all these cases because some people have already received their sums and some have been topped up by income support, which they will not necessarily now have to repay, and so on. Our best estimate of the total sum involved is between about &#163;3 million and &#163;4 million.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-05_para1"></a>The noble Lord pressed me about the point concerning a "reasonable" delay. The details of the scheme will be made more widely available next week and in the forthcoming weeks. The point of using that word was to draw a distinction between what I would call a casual delay, such as when someone delays giving information or is away for a few days, or possibly even when some benefits are paid a fortnight in arrears, and the unreasonable and unacceptable delay which has been caused by the NIRS 2 computer. It is meant to be a decent and generous scheme and not a weasel-like way to protect ourselves against that kind of situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-05_para2"></a>The noble Lord asked what the situation would be when someone chose to defer drawing down their state pension in order to gain from the additional 7.5 per cent. extra per year paid for each year of deferment in drawing down the old age pension, that being how the annuity rates balance out. In all fairness, I do not think that someone who was 66, say, could ask for their pension to be paid in November 1998 and, because of the delay, receive arrears and compensation, and then, having done a "best buy" calculation, say: "Thank you very much, but please ignore my request for it to be paid in November; I will have it paid as of August 1999 and as a result receive a higher annuity rate in perpetuity". The point at which a person says they wish to draw down their pension will be taken as evidence of their stated intention and the ordinary arrears and compensation payments will kick in as a result. I hope that that makes the situation clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-05_para3"></a>Finally, I again thank the House for its warm welcome. I am delighted that the Government recognise that, as a result of this, many elderly people, widows and people on incapacity benefit will have suffered not only stress but worry and distress. We are offering a helpline: we can give details of that to people who wish to make enquiries. I am delighted that the Government felt able to recognise this problem, even though it was not a problem of the Government's making but one that they inherited. The response has, in my view, been a decent and generous one.

<A NAME="90201-05_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill do now pass. Today's debate brings us to the conclusion of our scrutiny of the Bill. We have had some very wide-ranging debates, covering subjects as diverse as the direction of social security reform, the Contributions Agency's computer systems and some of the more esoteric regulations which underpin the social security system. I do not wish to take any more of your Lordships' time in rounding off those discussions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-05_para17"></a>Let me begin by reminding the House of the purpose of this Bill. This Bill will transfer the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue. This will enable businesses and individuals to sort out their tax and contributions questions through a single government department. The two organisations will be able to combine their expertise and resources on customer service and compliance.

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1296</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-05_para18"></a>The Bill will also transfer responsibility for policy on national insurance contributions from the Department of Social Security to the Treasury and the Inland Revenue, along with control and management of the National Insurance Fund. It will also provide a single focus for discussion of improved legislation guidance and procedures. Over time, it will make it easier to achieve a gradual alignment of the tax and NIC rules.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-05_para19"></a>As we have discussed, the Bill also provides for appeals on national insurance contributions matters to be heard by general and special tax appeal commissioners. As I have said, this is largely in response to points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, during the passage of the Social Security Act 1998.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-05_para20"></a>In our consideration of this Bill we have had some useful and at times highly technical debates. I am grateful for the constructive spirit--reflected again today--with which noble Lords have approached these. This has been one of the first Bills where new style explanatory notes have been published alongside the Bill. I am pleased that noble Lords have said that they found them helpful in assisting their preparation for these debates.

<A NAME = "90201-05_para21"></a>In comparison with some social security debates relatively few noble Lords have spoken but I like to think that we have made up in quality what we lacked in quantity. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has brought his considerable Treasury experience to bear in both his questioning and his knowledge of tax and pensions matters. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has similarly brought her experience of social security to these debates with good effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-05_para22"></a>It has been extremely valuable--if sometimes a little embarrassing--to have the experience of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, particularly on Part II of this Bill. I am sure he will be remembered--certainly within the department--for some time for his triumph in spotting a missing consequential amendment. He pointed out the matter to us in Committee when he was on his feet, and we rectified it at Report. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, has been unusually, though not totally, quiet in our debates--but I am sure that his vow of silence will not last for long in social security matters. I have been grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for his tireless attention to detail and pursuit of clarity, particularly on Schedule 2 to the Bill. Finally, I would like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, for her continual assistance and support at my side--even if at times she thought she was running a marathon between here and the Box as the technical questions flowed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-05_para23"></a>I said in my speech at Second Reading that this was a technical and largely mechanical Bill. I am sure that noble Lords would agree with me that that assessment was correct. But as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, said at Second Reading, it is precisely the technical Bills that need detailed scrutiny. I believe this House has given this Bill that scrutiny and that it can go to another place for consideration in better shape. I thank noble Lords who have helped in this work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak only briefly. First, I thank my noble friends Lady Anelay of St. Johns <P>


<a name="column_1297"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1297</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and Lord Astor of Hever for their support on the Front Bench. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, who certainly raised some extremely important points. As always, I have enjoyed the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, particularly his legal points, which certainly surpassed any expertise that I will ever have. I thank also the Minister for her great expertise. It may be that the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, has spent a lot of time running back and forth to clarify particular points--I hope she is not doing so now--but the reality is that the House has benefited greatly from the Minister's expertise in these areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para0"></a>I make only one point on that. The Minister tends to refer rather disparagingly to one's Treasury experience. At the end of the day, however technical the Bill--as has been demonstrated in the debate earlier this afternoon--we are dealing with real people and real problems, and it is the technical expertise which one brings to these matters that helps us to alleviate those problems and to improve the social security system.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para1"></a>I am most grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken. Certainly the Bill goes to the Commons in a much better state than it was when it arrived here. For that, we must all be grateful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I rise also briefly. First, I congratulate the noble Baroness on showing her usual mastery of the complex details of this highly technical Bill. I have been impressed by the way in which she has not merely relied on information that has been fed to her but has thrown into this Bill her own understanding and command of the details involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para2"></a>The House should be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, for pressing the issue of compensation for those who have suffered from the defects in the NIRS2 scheme--which was perhaps only rather incidentally involved in the Bill but was nevertheless of great importance. We should all be grateful to him. Indeed, we should all be grateful to the Government for their very rapid and effective response to those problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para3"></a>Finally, I am grateful for the suggestion that the Bill is to some extent instigated from points that I raised on the Social Security Bill; but this is something that was raised some time ago by the Tax Law Review Committee. An obviously correct move has been made, and I am glad that the Government have made it. I warmly welcome the fact that the Bill has now reached the end of its passage through your Lordships' House.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, before we move to the Statement on Kosovo, I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House that the Companion indicates that discussion on a Statement should be confined to brief comments and questions for clarification. Peers who speak at length do so at the expense of other noble Lords.

<A NAME="90201-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement on Kosovo which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend, the Foreign Secretary. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "90201-06_para5"></a>"With permission, I should like to make a Statement about recent developments on Kosovo.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para6"></a>"The situation on the ground remains tense. On Friday, over 20 Kosovar Albanians were shot in Rugovo. On Saturday, a hand grenade was lobbed into a cafe in Pristina frequented by Serbs, injuring eight, including one Albanian. Yesterday, two Serb policemen were injured when a grenade was fired into their van while they were returning from the funeral of a casualty of earlier conflict. Over 200 people have been killed since the Holbrooke agreement last October provided for a cease-fire.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para7"></a>"At its meeting in London last Friday, the Contact Group called on both sides to end hostilities now. They insisted on full compliance by Belgrade with its undertakings of last October and real co-operation with both the Verification Mission and the War Crimes Tribunal.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para8"></a>"The main focus of the meeting was on the urgent need to instil momentum into the political process. Since last October, Ambassadors Hill and Petritsch have developed the Contact Group's framework document for a political settlement. It reflects extensive consultation with both sides.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para9"></a>"Their detailed document provides for an interim accord for three years. That period would provide the opportunity for the creation of democratic self-government in Kosovo through free and fair elections supervised by the OSCE. The new institutions of Kosovo would enjoy a wide range of self-government, including control of its own police and internal security.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para10"></a>"The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would retain competence only for foreign policy, external defence, monetary policy, single market, customs and federal taxation. Both Serb and Albanian communities would be fully protected with the right to elected institutions preserving their national culture, language and education.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para11"></a>"The framework document provides that at the end of three years the future status of Kosovo would be reviewed under international auspices.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para12"></a>"Despite the extensive consultation and detailed work which has gone into the framework document by representatives of the Contact Group, in three months there has not been one negotiating meeting on it between Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanians.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para13"></a>"On Friday the Contact Group resolved on a programme of action to break that stalemate. We agreed to summon both sides to negotiations on the basis of the framework document. We set a tight timetable which requires both sides to attend talks by this Saturday and to conclude negotiations within less <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1299"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1299</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>than two further weeks. France has offered to provide a venue for the talks which will take place under the joint chairmanship of myself and Hubert Vedrine, the French Foreign Minister. Later on Friday the United Nations Security Council welcomed the strategy of the Contact Group and demanded that both parties should comply with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para14"></a>"On Saturday the North Atlantic Council also gave its full support to the strategy of the Contact Group and warned that NATO is ready to take whatever measures are necessary to avert the humanitarian catastrophe by compelling compliance with the demands of the international community. In the meantime the North Atlantic Council delegated to its Secretary-General, Javier Solana, authority to order military action in the light of the responses of both parties. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister discussed Kosovo with President Chirac during his visit last Thursday. They agreed that both Britain and France would be willing to consider the deployment, with their Allies, of ground troops in Kosovo to provide a period of stability and peace during which a political settlement could take root.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para15"></a>"I was instructed by the Contact Group to convey our demands to both parties and on Saturday I visited Belgrade and Skopje. I was accompanied throughout by Bill Walker, chief of the Verification Mission. The visit increased my respect for the valuable work of the Verification Mission. It has provided instant and reliable information on the atrocities which have invariably occurred in places where it is absent, and has undoubtedly deterred further atrocities where it is present. In Belgrade I met jointly with President Milosevic of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and President Milutinovic of the Republic of Serbia. I stressed to them that I came with the mandate of the united Contact Group and also backed by the authority of the North Atlantic Council. Our requirement of them to take part in negotiations under international chairmanship is the best opportunity Belgrade will get to extricate itself from a conflict that it cannot win. President Milosevic undertook to study the Contact Group proposals and to reply within a few days.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para16"></a>"In Skopje I met with Dr. Rugova, Mr. Demaqi and Mr. Qosja who between them represent a broad spectrum of Kosovar opinion. I stressed in all my conversations with the Kosovar Albanians that the proposals of the Contact Group offered a democratic, self-governing Kosovo free from the bloodshed of recent months. Dr. Rugova, who was elected overwhelmingly last year as leader of the Kosovar Albanians, welcomed the opportunity for talks and committed his party to participate fully in them. I also spoke by phone to Mr. Surroi, an independent publisher and a leading political figure in Pristina, who gave his full support to the proposals and expressed his willingness to participate. Mr. Demaqi who acts as political spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army and Mr. Qosja, leader of the third largest Kosovo Albanian party, both undertook to consult their colleagues and to let me have their response within days.

<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para17"></a>"Madam Speaker, I cannot confirm that the talks which we seek will take place. Nor can I guarantee that if they take place they will succeed. There remain serious issues of difference between the two sides which it will take hard negotiation to resolve, such as the nature of the review to take place in three years' time and the relationship between a self-governing Kosova and Serbia. But I can confirm that the meeting of the Contact Group showed real unity and a common determination to provide for progress towards a political settlement of the conflict. It is now for both parties to show the same commitment to finding a political solution. Neither of them can win the conflict by military means. Both of them would benefit from a political settlement. The offer of these talks, brokered by the Contact Group and backed by the Security Council and NATO, provides the best opportunity they will ever get to achieve a political settlement through dialogue. I urge both of them now to seize that opportunity and give the people of Kosovo hope for their future in place of their fear of the present bloodshed".
<P>
</UL>
<A NAME = "90201-06_para18"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_time1"></A><H5>3.44 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, I extend to the House my most sincere and deep apologies that my noble friend Lord Moynihan was informed by a government office that the Statement would not be made until 4.15 p.m. He is therefore not present at the moment. I crave the indulgence of the House in making my noble friend's speech (a copy of which has been faxed to me) on his behalf. My noble friend would have said that he is very grateful to the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place and for updating your Lordships' House on the results of the Foreign Secretary's mission to Belgrade and Skopje at the weekend. From these Benches, the Government have our full support as they actively seek a political solution to the ongoing crisis in Kosovo under the auspices of the Contact Group. We welcome the Contact Group's most recent action in summoning both sides to talks in France by the 6th February and the setting of a clear deadline for the conclusion of those talks, action which has been endorsed by both the UN Security Council and by NATO. Given that their participation in these proposed talks is not yet confirmed, when does the Minister anticipate that a response will be received from President Milosevic and the Kosovo Liberation Army respectively with regard to the demands of the Contact Group and the detailed plans which have been submitted to each party as a basis for negotiations to settle the future status of the province?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para19"></a>We also support the decision by NATO to authorise the use of force if deemed necessary, provided that any military action is predicated on clearly defined objectives. Can the Minister confirm that NATO forces are on 48 hours' notice, as has been reported? Is the Minister in a position to give any further details on the British preparations for the possible use of force and the likely time-scale of events should one or both sides fail to comply with the Contact Group's <P>


<a name="column_1301"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1301</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ultimatum by the given date? Should military strikes be authorised, what plans exist for the extraction of the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission prior to such action? In the light of the possible deployment of ground troops in Kosovo to monitor any peace settlement, which has been referred to by the Foreign Secretary, can the Minister provide any further details as to what this would entail? Given the failure last October to get the NATO partners to agree to such action in principle as part of an overall settlement, has consensus now been reached, and is it the case that all leading NATO nations would now take part in such a deployment? What discussions have been held with the United States on this question, given that the Foreign Secretary himself said on Friday that there is an interesting debate going on within America with regard to the deployment of ground troops?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para20"></a>From these Benches we share the Government's horror at the butchery which has taken place, and continues to take place, in Kosovo and we join the Government in unreservedly condemning such atrocities. Indeed, even as the countries of the Contact Group were finalising their ultimatum on Friday the bodies of 24 ethnic Albanians were found in the village of Rogovo. Most of the victims were reported to have been wearing civilian clothes. Can the Minister tell the House what progress has been made, by British verifiers and others, in investigating the cause of these deaths? Does the Minister agree that there should be a role for international war crimes investigators in this work, just as she did in the case of the massacre at Racak last month?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para21"></a>William Walker, the head of the Kosovo Verification Mission, has confirmed his belief that he has "absolutely no doubt" that the Serbs were behind the outrage at Racak. What discussions did the Foreign Secretary have with President Milosevic regarding access for war crime investigators to the area? Can the Minister comment on reports last week that US surveillance teams uncovered evidence of direct involvement by senior Serb politicians and military representatives, both in the massacre itself and the attempted cover-up which followed? Furthermore, can the Minister give the House any further information on the investigation being carried out by the Finnish forensic team, given that Helena Ranta, who is leading that team, has said that there is a possibility that the bodies had been tampered with during the period they were not under international supervision and that the truth about how they died may never be known?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para22"></a>From these Benches, we support the Government in their belief that the international community cannot simply stand by and watch as the ceasefire agreed in October day by day melts away with the onset of spring, and the brutal murders of innocent civilians become a tragically regular occurrence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para23"></a>We support the use of a clear ultimatum, backed by a credible alternative course of action, to break the cycle of violence in Kosovo and to bring both sides to the negotiating tables. Nevertheless, the Minister will be well aware that it is now eight months since the Foreign Secretary issued the first of a series of final warnings to <P>


<a name="column_1302"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>President Milosevic. As a result of last summer's policy, driven by the puff of rhetoric but devoid of any real action, the response of the international community was even described as "dithering and disunited" by the Prime Minister's own press secretary. Can the Minister give an assurance that those days of dithering are over and that on this occasion, the Government's deeds will prove as resolute as their words?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-06_para24"></a>That concludes the reply of my noble friend Lord Moynihan to the Statement. I again give my apologies to the House for the fact that he is not here in person to deliver it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I, too, apologise for missing, I believe, the first two sentences of the Minister's Statement for the reasons already given by the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. We had the impression that the Statement would be a little later.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para0"></a>First, I warmly welcome and support the action taken by Her Majesty's Government. We on these Benches have pleaded for a long time for a stronger position to be taken by the Contact Group; and we recognise the work of the Foreign Secretary in gaining support among his colleagues on that Contact Group. We are extremely grateful and very pleased to hear that at long last strong and determined action is to be taken. We praise the Foreign Secretary for his part in that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para1"></a>Secondly, it is important to remind the House that the decision to start on a very short timetable the negotiations between the Government of the former Republic of Yugoslavia and the Albanian/Kosovan delegation only reflects the more rapid timetable written into the Holbrooke Milosevic agreement which Mr. Milosevic had signed. That agreement indicated that talks would start in October and would be completed no later than November. Those who say that it is a sudden rush to negotiation have not read sufficiently carefully the Holbrooke Milosevic agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para2"></a>As regards, decision to make ground troops available in order to support the peace negotiations, should that be necessary, have other European countries which are members of NATO, in addition to France, been willing to commit their troops? We on these Benches congratulate France on agreeing with the British Government to make troops available.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para3"></a>In the Minister's view, will it be possible to bring pressure to bear on the Yugoslav army and Serbian police to ensure that no further action of any type is taken against civilians in the Kosovo area while the negotiations continue, in the light of the appalling massacres which have occurred over the past few days?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para4"></a>Will the Minister consider again the possibility of offering to the Government of Albania the support they need, in logistical and other terms, to police that border so as to prevent the steady flow of sophisticated arms across it, given that the OSCE and NATO support the concept of sanctions against Yugoslavia? Might that also be a useful card to play in ensuring that all sides are present at a negotiating table where, if any significant interest is not present, it might be possible later to denounce any agreement reached?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para5"></a>I conclude by again congratulating Her Majesty's Government on taking the first step towards what we on these Benches hope will be a genuine European response to the problems that beset our Continent around the edges but not within the European Union.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I start by offering apologies (if there are apologies to be offered). I am not clear what has happened as regards the timing. If anything on our side has gone wrong, I apologise, but I am not sure that it has. I hope that we can look at the matter through the usual channels. For my part, I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, delivered his noble friend's points extremely well. As always, I shall do my best to answer those points.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para6"></a>I am extremely grateful for the support of the official Opposition on the issue. As the Statement makes clear, it is a tense and difficult time. I thank, too, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, for her support. The noble Lord asked about the response from Mr. Milosevic. We are hoping for a response as quickly as possible. Mr. Milosevic said that he would consider the points put to him, as did Mr. Qosja and Mr. Dimaqi. We have said that we expect to see them this coming Saturday. Therefore for arrangements to be made one would expect that response to come very quickly indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Burnham, put a number of detailed points to me on military action. I am sure that he will understand that, while we would all sympathise with his questions on detailed military planning, it is not sensible to go into such detailed planning at present. We are in very close touch with our allies--with the United States and others. But at present the sensible action is for us to concentrate upon the need to get the parties round the negotiating table as quickly as possible. That is what we have been concentrating on with our partners in the Contact Group. That is why my right honourable friend spent the weekend in Belgrade and Skopje.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para8"></a>The noble Lord asked about the extraction force. As noble Lords know, the extraction force of some 2,400 strong is based at present in Macedonia. It is French led and there are 350 British personnel there. We are confident that the extraction force can do the job that we hope it will do if it were ever to come to real necessity. I stress to all noble Lords that we must concentrate on this as a set of negotiations and provide the best possible atmosphere for those consultations to take place in a constructive way.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para9"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the war crimes. Of course we believe that the war crimes investigator, the International Criminal Tribunal, should have access to all possible areas where war crimes have been committed. The problem has been that when the investigators cannot go to where alleged atrocities have taken place, they are unable to carry out the investigations so necessary to their work. Perhaps I may remind your Lordships that UNSCR 1207, which was adopted in November last year, is a mandatory Chapter VII resolution which reiterates the need for the federal republic to fully honour its obligations towards the <P>


<a name="column_1304"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>international tribunal. It sends a clear message that the FRY must not be allowed to flout its legal obligations for co-operation. The will of the international community has been expressed in that Security Council resolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para10"></a>We do not believe that it is a matter for the federal republic to judge whether the ICTY has the necessary jurisdiction to investigate any possible crimes in Kosovo. We believe that it has a clear obligation to comply and we shall be pursuing that. I am sure that all noble Lords would wish to join with me in the views of the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, as expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, as regards the horror at the crimes which have taken place. The horror of what has happened in individual terms has been all too appallingly apparent, alas, on our television screens. I am sure that many of us have been very moved and grieved by what we have seen.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para11"></a>I point out to noble Lords that in all of this Her Majesty's Government have not been dithering. Whatever has been happening internationally, Her Majesty's Government have been determined to secure progress. I believe that my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has shown great determination and leadership in this matter--hence the meeting over the weekend and the feeling of the Contact Group in London that my right honourable friend should be its emissary to Skopje and Belgrade during the weekend.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para12"></a>I reiterate to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, that France has not committed itself to ground troops any more than Her Majesty's Government have done. We have committed ourselves to being willing to consider putting in ground troops. I agree that that is quite a positive statement, but I would not like the noble Baroness to think that there was a complete commitment on this issue. We are talking to our allies elsewhere. We shall need to take considerable soundings as regards the views of our allies over the provision of ground troops. We very much hope that no side will take action against civilians during this period. That is what we have hoped throughout. We have a ceasefire which has not been honoured. From the position at the moment, it is hard to know how much non-compliance with this ceasefire has in any way been sanctioned by political leadership. That is the problem which we have to address here.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-07_para13"></a>We shall continue to reiterate to all the participants in this very unhappy conflict the absolute need not to use military force on the unfortunate and unarmed civilians who have very obviously been the unhappy victims of some of the dreadful atrocities that we have seen. I agree with the noble Baroness that it is enormously important that the OSCE continues to do what it can to monitor what is happening on the borders. I must refer again to a particular passage in my right honourable friend's Statement that the OSCE has been very effective in stopping some of the atrocities where it has had a presence. It is where it has not had a presence that the atrocities have continued. I agree with the noble Baroness that it is important to monitor the movements of weaponry in this situation. I also agree that the European dimension is a very important part of the way forward in trying to sort out this conflict.

<A NAME="90201-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Baroness say whether the transitional period of three years will allow the people of Kosovo, at the end of that time, either through their elected representatives or through a referendum, to declare total independence if that is their will? Does the noble Baroness appreciate that it is an important condition to get the KLA representative to the conference table and that the option for complete independence is not totally closed off? Will she also deal with the point raised in an article in Der Spiegel this morning by one of the KLA leaders that they are about to elect their own representatives who will be in office from 10th February onwards? If that poses a difficulty for the timetable, bearing in mind that the proceedings at Rambouillet are supposed to start on the 6th, is there to be any flexibility? Would the Contact Group be prepared to extend the period of negotiations by starting, say, a week later if that were a condition which allowed the KLA to take part?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, as regards the first question about the three-year period, the framework document, which has been the subject already of so much discussion, provides that the future status of Kosovo would be reviewed under international auspices. That might be through an international conference or there may a number of different ways in which that can be done. To determine at this stage what is meant exactly by the future status of Kosovo would be a mistake. I believe that that is exactly the kind of issue that should be considered in the discussions between representatives of Belgrade and the other individuals whom my right honourable friend met in Skopje over the weekend. I believe that is one of the things that the discussions in Rambouillet should be concentrated upon.

<A NAME = "90201-08_para0"></a>The noble Lord makes the point about possible elections making a difference and the possibility of postponement. I am bound to say to the noble Lord that I believe that not only my right honourable friend but other members of the Contact Group are very well seized of the political situation. There has always been a reason for a little more delay on this matter. The international community is now pretty determined that discussions should go ahead at the weekend. If good and sound reasons arise during the week I am not in a position to judge what might be decided. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that most of the international commentators and those who know more about the situation than I do recognise that this is a very urgent situation, which needs a very urgent solution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I refer the noble and gallant Lord to the Statement that I read out on behalf of my right honourable friend a few moments ago. It states that the North Atlantic Council had delegated to its Secretary-General, Javier Solana, authority to order military action in the light of the responses of those parties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that at the Council of Europe held last Thursday I attended a meeting with Mr. Westerdorp, the High Commissioner for Bosnia? He was asked how long he expected the civilian monitors to be in place in Bosnia. He said that it would be for at least a generation. The current cost is at least 1.5 billion dollars a year, which does not include any of the military forces. Does my noble friend agree that, whatever the success of the current initiative, we, through NATO, will be making a substantial commitment to this region for many years to come?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the cost of peace is never cheap. The fact is that it costs a great deal to keep troops in readiness on the one hand and international monitors on the other; and also, of course, to have an extraction force standing by. The points that my noble friend makes serve only to emphasise the very robust Statement of my right honourable friend, which is that no part of this dreadful situation in Kosovo can be resolved through military action. It has to be resolved through negotiation. That is why my right honourable friend has taken the lead over this issue and why all members of the Contact Group are four square in support that the discussions go ahead in Rambouillet next weekend with maximum participation from those who have the right to speak on behalf of all sides of the people of Kosovo.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Merlyn-Rees: </B>   My Lords, the Minister was careful to advise us to concentrate on political negotiations. She is absolutely right about that. But as regards military preparations, military thinking and the involvement of ground forces, I hope that the Government will put into the discussions a warning by way of what happened in Yugoslavia in the last war. The involvement of large numbers of military forces against guerrilla forces did not work at all. We must be extremely careful as to what our ground forces will do in that area, if indeed they go in there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I very much take to heart what my noble friend said. I do not believe that anything I have said on behalf of my right honourable friend implies that there will be a situation in which large numbers of Her Majesty's Government's forces would be involved in fighting their way into Kosovo. That is not a point in question here. I stress to my noble friend the point which I made to my noble friend Lord Ponsonby a moment or two ago. <P>


<a name="column_1307"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1307</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>No side--not the combatants on the ground and certainly no forces from outside Kosovo--can resolve the issue through fighting. All that can be achieved will be achieved through negotiations. That is what makes the next few days so crucial. All people of good will--not only in the contact group but also elsewhere--should bring whatever influence they can to bear upon the combatants to meet in Rambouillet; to sit round the table; and to discuss a way through this dreadful and appalling conflict.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, in answer to previous questions, the noble Baroness was careful in her use of words. I believe that she was making the point that the United Kingdom and France would consider using ground troops if that were requested. What is the American position?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I am always careful in my use of words, particularly when such serious matters are at stake. I was repeating what my right honourable friend said about the Prime Minister's discussions on Kosovo with President Chirac during last Thursday's visit. Both Britain and France agreed that they would be willing to consider deployment with their allies of ground troops in Kosovo in order to provide a period of stability and peace during which a political settlement could take root. It is the whole context of those remarks which is so important.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-08_para1"></a>As far as I know, our allies, the United States, are still considering the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that, if it is necessary to have a deployment of ground troops, which clearly must be a combined force from a substantial number of countries, to provide a period of stability and peace, that may well be a lengthy engagement? We must recognise that that is the sort of commitment into which we and others may be entering.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-08_para2"></a>Will the Minister say a little more about the situation in northern Albania and the control of the Albanian border? As we understand it, one of the problems that has led to the recent fighting in Kosovo is the provision of heavy and advanced weaponry across the Albanian border and the state of disorder in northern Albania. If we are to impose sanctions on all the participants, is that not something which the western allies will have to take on board rather more firmly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord says that a lengthy engagement may be involved. Until we get people together round a table to discuss the way forward, it is extremely difficult to judge for how long such a deployment would be necessary. Will it be for the three-year period that is being discussed at present? Quite honestly, that is not a question which can be answered at the moment. If we reach that situation, the allies will have to monitor the position closely, in the same way as we shall monitor the need to keep the OSCE monitors on the ground.

<A NAME = "90201-08_para3"></a>While I understand the noble Lord's question and what motivates it, it is virtually impossible to answer at the moment. If we do put in ground troops, we shall not do that with a view to taking them away the following week. There would have to be a clear commitment to sustain them for the period which they were needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-08_para4"></a>The noble Lord asked some detailed questions on the situation in northern Albania. I shall have to write to him with details about the position there. The noble Lord referred to heavy weaponry. I do not wish to give an answer from the Dispatch Box which I have to correct in writing tomorrow. Therefore, I shall write to the noble Lord and, as I imagine that many noble Lords will be interested, I shall place a copy of the letter in the Library of the House.

<A NAME="90201-08_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, can the contact group be summoned again at short notice? There appears to be a probability, or at least a possibility, that President Milosevic will not say yes or no--he rarely says yes or no--but will suggest an alternative framework for negotiation. According to some press reports, he may suggest looking again at the decisions which have been taken in relation to Bosnia. If some proposals come from President Milosevic, is it possible for the contact group to consider them almost immediately or is it wholly bound by the timetable which the Minister indicated to us?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-08_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, from this Dispatch Box I should hate to say anything which might give anybody an excuse to think that they could buy more time. As the noble Lord pointed out, President Milosevic has a history of skilfully buying more time when he believes that that is what his interests dictate. The contact group has been fairly clear about that. In the Statement my right honourable friend used the word "summoned". The contact group believes that time has run out. There is a definite date for the meeting in Rambouillet, which is next Saturday. We expect President Milosevic to be there.

<A NAME="90201-09_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   My Lords, what is the Government's assessment of public opinion in the former Yugoslavia? What proportion of the public does she believe is behind a negotiated settlement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, in a war-torn country I do not believe that public opinion polls and focus groups are necessarily foremost in people's minds. One can imagine what public opinion must be in a country which must witness on an almost weekly basis the most appalling atrocities involving unarmed civilians, the elderly and children. Very often, there is not a man of fighting age in sight. Whether we are government Ministers or watching these appalling events unfolding in our own living rooms on the television, if we look at the faces of those involved, we can know fairly well what public opinion is at the moment.

But military action by itself rarely solves the world's difficulties and wrongs. There is a particular difficulty when it involves a single country and an internal conflict. I am sure that the noble Baroness speaks for the whole House when she says that she wishes to see the discussions at Rambouillet going ahead on the most constructive basis possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-09_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross </B>   moved Amendment No. 59A:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 45, line 21, leave out from ("court") to end of line 27 and insert ("that the circumstances set out in the report by the panel under paragraph 2 of this Schedule accord with the provisions for a referral back in section 7, 10 or 11 of this Act,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para6"></a>The noble Viscount said: I am glad that the Committee stage was adjourned when it was last week in order for me to transform a somewhat cryptic note to the noble Lord, Lord Williams, into an amendment for his consideration. I am concerned with the formulation in paragraph 5 of the first schedule and the situation that will arise. There will have been a referral to a youth panel of an offender who falls into the right kind of categories which are set out in the Bill. Then something will have gone wrong and the question will arise as to whether that offender should be referred back to the youth court in order that the matter can be reconsidered.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para7"></a>The modern analogy for what now appears in Paragraph 5 is the provision in Schedule 2 to the Criminal Justice Act 1991 for breaches of community sentences such as probation orders and community service orders. In those circumstances the court, whether it be a magistrates' court or the Crown Court, has to be satisfied about certain matters, but they are nothing like as specific as they are here. It then can have the power <P>


<a name="column_1310"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1310</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to deal with the matter afresh, as if it had not previously made a community order, but taking into account of course the extent to which any such order has been complied with.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para8"></a>In this Bill the matter has been spelt out in some considerable detail. If the panel wishes to refer an offender back, the court has to go through an elaborate set of considerations. It has to look upon the finding of fact by the panel and decide whether the panel was entitled to make that finding or, if it was a matter of discretion, whether the panel reasonably exercised that discretion.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para9"></a>I suggest to the Committee that the relationship between a youth court and the local youth offender team, who I am sure will be a part of the panel system, will be one of mutual trust. Certainly in my experience, when dealing with my own probation service, one does not expect the probation service to bring back to court a breach of a community sentence unless there is good reason for it. And although there is technically a reason, unless there is a requirement that the court should be satisfied, there is no spelling out of the details as to what the court has to be satisfied about. I therefore wonder why it has to be spelt out in such detail in Paragraph 5.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para10"></a>My amendment probably does not take account of all the drafting niceties because no amendment drafted by a Back Bencher ever does, but I draw the noble Lord's attention to the circumstance of some of these referrals back, particularly those in Clause 11(4), and particularly where, in effect, the system--the contract--has broken down and it is being taken back to the court so that it can be looked at afresh.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para11"></a>Why, in those circumstances, should a court question the exercise of discretion by the panel? Perhaps I may ask the noble Lord the following question. Supposing it goes into the details set out in the text as it now appears, and comes to the conclusion that the finding of fact is not justifiable or that the exercise of discretion was not reasonably carried out, what then is to occur? There will have been a referral back; the youth panel will have decided that the matter will not proceed; the contract will not work; and the court to whom it is referred back will really be put in an impossible situation. I suggest to the Committee that the way in which it is put at the moment is too elaborate and it could be left to a much more simple formula which will reflect the trust that will arise between the court and the youth offender team. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I should like to give rather diffident support to the approach adopted by the noble Viscount. There is a small problem which occurred to me. It is a slightly related matter, and I raise it with diffidence, but it seems to arise out of these matters. If an offender is referred back, either under the wording in the Bill at present or under the wording proposed, and the court decides that it was properly referred back, then the order is revoked in any case and the court can then proceed if it wishes, and thinks it right, to sentence the offender further.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para12"></a>However, if it is referred back and the court decides, for whatever reason, that it was not properly referred back by the panel and the time of the contract has <P>


<a name="column_1311"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1311</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expired by that time then, as I understand it, the order is automatically discharged rather than revoked and no further penalty can presumably be imposed in those circumstances. That seems to be an awkwardness which arises from the wording of this particular part of the schedule.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am most grateful, as always, for the courtesy with which the noble Viscount approaches these matters, in writing to me as he said. I sympathise with his view that the procedures for the court, the panel and the young offender should be set out as simply as possible. Also, there must be no question that the actions of the panel are put on trial in any sense at a breach hearing. However, we have to bear in mind that the court does have a role as a supervisory jurisdiction and in the circumstances it is of the greatest importance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para13"></a>There are a few circumstances which may prompt a panel to refer a young offender back to the court. Clause 7(2), as your Lordships will know, gives the panel the discretion to refer the young offender back to court if he or she fails to attend a panel meeting. Under Clause 10(2) or (3) the panel shall refer the young offender back to court if there appears to be no prospect of agreeing a contract or where a contract appears to have been agreed but the young offender refuses to sign it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para14"></a>Under Clause 11(5) again the panel may refer a young offender back to court following a breach of the terms of the contract. Under Clause 11(8) or (10) the panel may refer the young offender back to court if he or she fails to sign a variation of the contract, or indicates that there is a change of circumstances such as to warrant a revocation of the order. Under Clause 12(4)--and I think the noble Viscount is right, because his amendment does not deal with this but it is a drafting point, as he says--the court shall refer the offender back to court if at the end of a contract period he or she has failed to comply.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para15"></a>In some of these circumstances, such as failure to agree a contract from the outset, the youth offender panel has a positive duty to refer the young offender back to court. The young offender is unable or unwilling to comply with the terms of the referral order, and the court must be given the opportunity to consider an alternative sentence. The court will be able to do so as soon as it is satisfied that the circumstances did indeed take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para16"></a>In other circumstances, of course, the panel has a choice. Perhaps the most obvious example is where a breach of the terms of the contract has taken place. In those circumstances the panel may refer the young offender back to court and that is the element of discretion to which I referred earlier. This must be right, because further inquiry may be needed and the breach may be minor. Alternatively, it may have happened only once and although it may be a slip on the part of the young offender there is every belief that he or she will comply in the future. It may further have been a breach beyond the control of the young offender brought about by ill health or the actions of others, and so those <P>


<a name="column_1312"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1312</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances need to be investigated by the panel before a decision on whether to bring breach proceedings is reached.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para17"></a>In such circumstances, it will not be enough for the court simply to make a finding of fact that a breach has taken place. The young offender may well agree that he failed to comply on a certain occasion but may not agree that his or her actions were sufficient to discredit the contract entirely. It is important that there should be an opportunity for the court to hear arguments on this point from the young offender, or his or her legal representative. This is not a matter of putting the panel on trial but of ensuring that the young offender has a chance to have his say.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para18"></a>For those reasons it is important that the court is asked to consider not only the facts--that is to say, whether or not a breach occurred--but also whether the response to that breach was reasonable and proportionate in the particular circumstances of the case. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, asked a specific question as to what would happen if the period had expired. The answer is in paragraph 7(3) where we see that it will be discharged.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para19"></a>I turn now to the question of the noble Viscount: that, is, what would happen if the court concluded that there was no breach. If the court concludes that there is no breach, the young offender remains subject to the referral order. The court may suggest some variation to the order to enable the offender more easily to comply. I appreciate that there is a good deal of detail set out here. In the context of the new method of disposal, we feel that that is right. It gives discretion and mandatory duty to the panel. I hope that with that explanation the noble Viscount will feel sufficiently content not to press his amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_time1"></A><H5>4.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-09_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I suspect that in practice it will not matter much, but I make two points which the noble Lord and his advisers may wish to consider.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para20"></a>First, the magistrates do not sit only in relation to these sorts of proceedings; they deal with a whole range of matters, including ordinary community sentences. They will wonder why Parliament set out different tests and what it is they are supposed to do that is different from the other circumstances when a breach is referred back to them. All I suggest to the Minister is that there will be confusion as to the role they have to play.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para21"></a>Secondly, if paragraph (5) has to be explored in the detail which will be necessary to establish to the satisfaction of the court that the facts or the discretion have been rightly dealt with, then the youth court will have to go into quite a lot of delicate negotiations and arrangements between the young offender and the people who are trying to set up a positive regime to look after him. Those are not usually susceptible to a positive solution by public discussion in a court. It is unlikely that progress will be made in that forum and it is much better, on the whole, for the matter to be dealt with by the youth offending team and only in extremis, at the end, if a breach is thought to be impossible to resolve in any other way, should it be taken back to the court.
<P>


<a name="column_1313"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1313</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-09_para22"></a>The explanation of the noble Lord is perfectly reasonable in terms of the legal drafting, but when it comes to the reality of what is going to happen as between a court, a very young offender and the youth offending team which is supposed to be looking after him, the wording will not produce anything different from the straightforward and simple situation suggested in my amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I am sorry for interrupting the noble Viscount and I am grateful to the Minister for referring me to paragraph 7(3) of Schedule 1. The point I was trying to make--to which I do not need an immediate reply--is that under paragraph 7(3) an order is discharged; that is to say, nothing further can happen to the offender. I understand that that is the difference between it being discharged and being revoked. It seems to me that in some circumstances the reason for the offender being referred back to the court will be because, although the time of the proposed contract has elapsed, the offender has not fulfilled its terms. In those circumstances, if the court is doubtful about the panel's decision the offender will automatically "get off" and that may not be right.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para0"></a>Perhaps I have misunderstood the situation. I do not wish to press the Minister at this point to respond to my comments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Before the noble Viscount decides whether or not he intends to withdraw his amendment, perhaps I can respond to both of those points. I am grateful to the noble Viscount. As I indicated on earlier occasions when he was most helpful in raising these questions, I shall give the matter further thought with officials. The noble Viscount may well be right as to the practical outcome. And, of course, I shall look again at the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Cope, and write to him, undoubtedly before we meet again in a week's time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-10_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Williams, is always most accommodating. What I want to achieve as a result of this discussion is something that will be easy and fits in with the sort of situation to which the courts and youth offending teams will have to apply their minds. I am happy to leave it to the noble Lord and his advisers to look at the matter again. There is nothing wrong with it; it is just too elaborate. If he says he will look at it again, I am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment prohibits the youth court from passing custodial sentences on young offenders who fail to complete a contract they have made with the youth referral panel. The youth court will <P>


<a name="column_1314"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1314</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>retain the ability to pass any other form of sentence on such young offenders, including fines, reparation orders, supervision orders, attendance centre orders, action plan orders and community service orders.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para4"></a>The young people concerned will be juveniles who have appeared in court for the first time and plead guilty. Part I of the Bill requires the youth court to refer the majority of such young people to a youth referral panel. The youth panel and the young offenders will have to draw up a contract which will involve the young person in appropriate activities such as reparation of the victim or the community and in work designed to tackle the cause of offending. So far there is no dispute. If the young person does not comply with the contract, he or she will be returned to court to be sentenced for the original offence. If they complete the contract successfully, then Schedule 3, paragraph 5, of the Bill provides for the offence to be spent for the purpose of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para5"></a>This is a fairly imaginative development which will have a number of advantages over the current youth court procedures. The panel will be better able to involve a young person and the parents fully in discussing the offence, its impact on the victims and the steps which should be taken to make amends and ensure that there is no repetition. In the more formal proceedings of the youth court, young offenders and their parents often fail to understand fully what is happening and the legal procedures can hinder the process of getting young people and parents to speak and contribute fully to the discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para6"></a>Furthermore, in a panel setting the drawing up of a contract can concentrate on the best course of action to prevent reoffending, including attention to developing the welfare needs of the young person and his or her family. I have in mind examples such as family counselling, educational measures and help with drug abuse. While courts can use welfare-related measures--for example, a supervision order--they can do so only if the offence is regarded as sufficiently serious to warrant such a sentence. In the result, many young people appearing in the court for the first time miss out on the welfare intervention which could help steer them away from further trouble.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para7"></a>It is important to ensure that disproportionate sanctions are not imposed for failing to keep to a contract which has been agreed in a non-court setting. The procedure of the panel will not contain all the safeguards of due process which apply in a court setting and the contract will not be subject to the full limits of proportionality which apply in court sentences.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para8"></a>It does not seem right that a failure to abide by a contract, agreed in a non-court setting, should be subject to the full range of youth court penalties, including custody. That is especially so as the referring court must have decided that the original offence did not merit custody before making the referral to the panel.

<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para9"></a>It is therefore submitted that it would be disproportionate to allow a court to impose custody for failure to abide by a contract agreed in a non-judicial setting, following a first court appearance for an offence which was judged not to deserve custody. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   With the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, I do not agree with Amendment No. 61. When the offender first appears in court, the magistrates have at that stage the option of sending him or her to prison, if they think that it is a very serious offence. There may be marginal cases about which the magistrates need to deliberate carefully on whether to send a defendant to prison or allow him or her to appear before a panel. If the magistrates come down on the side of sending him or her to a panel, but the panel does not work in terms of agreeing a contract or the contract is not completed, the offender will return to the court. The noble Lord set out many of the options available, but it seems to me that the court should have available to it the option that it was considering when it first dealt with the offender. The Government's wording is correct in this instance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para10"></a>Amendment No. 62, which is grouped with Amendment No. 61, concerns what happens if the panel system is not successful in a particular case and the youth is returned to court. As the Bill stands, the court seems to be intended to approach the matter as if the youth offender panel had never existed and nothing had happened in that respect. In some cases, that will be quite right. However, there may also be cases where the offender, having been sent to the panel--in some cases compulsorily as far as the court is concerned or by discretion--makes life so difficult for the panel that it is impossible to agree to a contract; or where the offender lightly agrees a contract and then makes no effort to pursue it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para11"></a>Young people in such circumstances can be extremely manipulative of those trying to help them as well as of those trying to punish them. They can, and sometimes do, string a panel along. In those circumstances, it seems appropriate that the court should have the power to impose an additional sentence on a young offender for wasting the time of the panel--and, indirectly, of the court--by his or her behaviour. I expect that that power would be used only in blatant cases. If there is no such power, it is likely that a panel's time will be wasted by young offenders who think of it as a soft option. Once that starts, and it is realised that there is no penalty, I believe that that practice will grow. I believe that the suggestion in Amendment No. 62 is worthy of the Committee's consideration.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I should like to add to what my noble friend Lord Cope has said. The main point is that Amendment No. 61 would fetter the discretion of the court; that is, the discretion that a court would normally have with regard to a serious offence. We must also bear in mind that only offenders who are under 18 years of age are made subject to a referral order. As they pass the age of 18, one may expect better behaviour as they mature. If young offenders have failed to co-operate <P>


<a name="column_1316"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1316</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the body to which the referral order is made (instead of having been sentenced by the court for quite a serious offence), I do not think that they should be able to get away with that, as the amendment would allow.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-10_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   If the Minister disagrees with Amendment No. 61, as I expect will be the case, will he tell us whether it is expected that what the court does will depend partly on the original offence, for which the offender was sent to the panel, and on the nature of the breaking of the contract, or the refusal to sign it? Are those two matters to be taken into account? I imagine that they will be, but it would be interesting to have that confirmed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-10_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I support my noble friend Lord Dholakia in his Amendment No. 61. It seems reasonable to me that a child who is referred to a court by a youth offender panel should be resentenced, but without the possibility of a custodial resentence. The Minister has already said that there will be no punishment for being referred back to the court. That is unlike the response for a breach of a probation order or some other community sentence. In those circumstances, the offender is punished for the breach as well as being resentenced for the original offence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para12"></a>As regards the position of no punishment for being referred back, the youth court will have had the opportunity to impose a custodial sentence when the child first appeared before it and pleaded guilty. The youth court will have decided not to impose a custodial sentence because the offence was not sufficiently serious. Therefore, I believe that the decision not to impose a custodial sentence should be carried forward to referral-back proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-10_para13"></a>The merits of the limitation of the youth court's powers of resentencing will confirm the principles of restorative and rehabilitative justice and the determination not to write off a young offender who will, after all, have pleaded guilty to a first offence. Experience of working on an intensive probation project suggests to me that such schemes--I include the youth offender panels and their contracts--may require a level of maturity not always present in very young offenders. The youth court must recognise that and find another community-based sentence.

<A NAME="90201-11_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Brentford: </B>   I am not very happy about Amendment No. 61 for the reasons put forward by my noble friend Lord Renton. It reduces the options open to the court, which I should like to see remain as flexible as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-11_para0"></a>I am intrigued by Amendment No. 62 which was tabled by my noble friend Lord Cope. I can see the frustration in the behaviour of certain young people in breaching the terms of the referral contract. Does the Minister think that being able to add to the punishment because of such a breach will change the atmosphere surrounding the contract so that it has more of a legal basis--indeed, it does have a legal basis--or rather, more of a court structure about it, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid? I like the idea, but I wonder <P>


<a name="column_1317"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1317</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether it runs contrary to the type of atmosphere that this movement is trying to bring about? I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-11_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   Amendment No. 61 appears to me to make a most amazing proposition. We have a situation where a serious offence has been committed and by eloquent pleading of how extremely sorry the young offender is, how he intends to live a wonderful life thereafter, and how deeply sorry he is for the pain that he has inflicted upon the victim, the court says to him: "By the skin of your teeth, you have just escaped a custodial sentence". He then goes to the panel where, in extreme bloody-mindedness, he entirely refuses to do anything that is suggested and he is referred back to the court. Thereafter, we are told that the court who said, "You have escaped by the skin of your teeth, because you are so penitent", will not be allowed to send him to prison on the grounds that he is not really repentant at all. That seems to me to be extraordinary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   It is not so extraordinary if one actually considers what the noble Viscount, Lord Brentford, correctly identified as a new beginning in dealing with first offenders--and the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, also pointed this out--who have pleaded guilty and who are under the age of 18.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-11_para1"></a>We are trying to set out new measures for dealing with offenders in that particularly limited category. At present, the Bill allows the court to sentence the young offender for the original offence using the full range of sentencing options which would have been available to it if it were not for the mandatory referral. In doing so, the court must take into account the extent to which the offender had already complied with the terms of the contract and the reason given for the breach. As Members of the Committee have rightly observed, the Bill makes no provision for the circumstances of the breach or the extent of compliance to be used as aggravating factors; it is not intended that they should be.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-11_para2"></a>Perhaps I may set out our thinking and try to reconcile the different themes that have been expressed in noble Lords' observations. Our thinking is that this is a completely new way of dealing with young offenders whose limited category I have already described. I support the principle and the thinking behind the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, but I do not believe that the provision is necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-11_para3"></a>I turn now to the important question of this being a fettering of discretion, as argued by the noble Lord, Lord Renton. It is not. The sentencing discretion has already been exercised. All offences made the subject of a referral order will already have been the subject of the court's discretion. I say that because, in its discretion, it comes to the conclusion that the offence in question--the index offence, if I may call it so--does not warrant a custodial sentence. The circumstances of the breach are not to be used as aggravating factors and, therefore, the situation about which the noble Lord was concerned should not be capable of arising. I hope, <P>


<a name="column_1318"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1318</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therefore, that I have set the noble Lord's mind at rest. I believe that our approach to these orders is exactly the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-11_para4"></a>In recognising that this is a new form of disposal, the noble Lord, Lord Cope, has taken a different approach by seeking to penalise the young offender further in the light of time wasted by the panel. We do not wish there to be a sanction for failing to comply with a referral order in the sense of added days' custody, or whatever the noble Lord has in mind. The young offender is bound to realise the consequence of non-compliance because he or she will be called back to court for a new sentence to be passed. It is not to be overlooked. I recognise, of course, that this will not be foremost in the minds of those who are under 18, but the time taken for conviction to be spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act will be more than if they complied with the contract because, as we established on an earlier occasion, the conviction is spent as soon as the contract is successfully signed off.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-11_para5"></a>I turn now to the other questions raised, one of which came from the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, and related to whether or not the court, on referral back to it, would take into account the original offence when dealing with the offender. The answer is to be found in paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 which says that the court,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may deal with him in any manner in which ... he could have been dealt with for that offence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
So that deals with the circumstances of the original offence. I believe that I dealt with the noble Baroness's question about the nature of the breach: it cannot be taken as an aggravation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-11_para6"></a>I believe that I also dealt with the spirit of the points raised by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie. Again, I believe that we are at one. I simply reiterate the thinking expressed by the noble Viscount, Lord Brentford, that this is a new remedy and a new approach. It is, I believe, a breaking of the mould in many ways as regards the way we have dealt with this particular group of people. I stress again the fact that this is a very particular group. They are first-time offenders who have pleaded guilty and who are under 18 years of age. It is notoriously well known that, if we stop reoffending by that group, we will have made a very important start on stopping the endless recidivism which is so dismal and such a feature of our criminal justice system for young people. I hope that I have explained the Government's thinking on the matter. This is intended to be new. What happened in the past has not been universally successful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, replies, perhaps I may put this proposition to the Minister. Although the offence which the youthful offender committed was very serious, let us suppose that the court decided not to use its power but to make a referral order instead. Let us further suppose that, as has been said, there was a complete lack of co-operation on the part of the youthful offender. In those circumstances, are we to be told that the court is not allowed to have <P>


<a name="column_1319"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1319</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any second thoughts on the matter? Is it bound by its original lenient offer to the young offender, which he has abused?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-11_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   Before the Minister answers, perhaps I may press the point that I made which is slightly stronger. If the young offender's subsequent behaviour reveals in effect that he lied to the court or misled it in saying that he was penitent and that, therefore, he only avoided a custodial sentence by so doing, it seems extraordinary that the court has to go on acting in the way that it would only have done on the basis of the lies that the young offender told the first time round.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I return to my original proposition: we are dealing with a very limited group of people. The noble Viscount used words like, "Lied in the first place", but these are people who have committed crimes and pleaded guilty. They are first-time offenders. If the court was originally over-lenient, in many ways that is perhaps a reproach on the original court's sentencing.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-11_para7"></a>I am coming back to the point of principle. It is not a fetter on the discretion of the court because it exercised its discretion in the first place. If things do not work, it can use the armoury of weapons that it had in the first place, but may not impose a custodial sentence. The reason is that it made its inquiries and came to the conclusion that a custodial sentence was not appropriate for that offender. It is possible that the referral order will in effect be breached by the commission of further offences. If further offences are committed, there is no reason at all why the court should not consider re-sentencing in that context. Indeed, it would be obligatory for the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-11_para8"></a>As I said, we believe that this is a new beginning. We need to wrench our sentencing minds away from a regime which did not work well in the past in the context of the very limited description attached to these offenders. I am not saying that they will be limited in number, but the description attached to them at present is quite limited. I believe that we have got it right. We must see whether or not we can get a productive, co-operative referral scheme working which is far more imaginative, far more reflective and far more thoughtful about the needs of young people and the way to deal with them than anything we have had in the past.

<A NAME="90201-11_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Williams, has said something which concerns me greatly. I refer to paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 1. Assuming that Section 1 had not applied, on the face of the schedule as it stands I can see no fetter on the powers of the magistrates' court to use youth custody if that is the proper thing to do. The noble Lord has suggested that having made up its mind it would not do so in the first place, it then cannot do that if there is a referral back to it. That appears to me to ignore the words in brackets in paragraph 5(5)(a) whereby the court can deal with the person concerned as if Section 1 was not in force. Therefore it seems to me that the <P>


<a name="column_1320"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1320</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>full range of powers is open to the magistrates. If their approach of submitting the young offender to the panel has proved not to work, they may well have to commit him to the Crown Court for sentence. Is that not right?

<P>
<A NAME="90201-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I repeat what I said earlier; namely, it is not intended that the circumstances of the breach should be not an aggravating consequence. The noble Viscount is right to say that there is no fetter. It is theoretically just possible in a limited number of cases that the balance may be tipped in favour of custody on resentence. However, I return to the point that the original sentencing decision has been made with knowledge of the facts and the appropriate reports. The court has come to the conclusion at the time of first sentence that it will not sentence this young person to custody; that is, a first time offender who has pleaded guilty. I shall consider these points carefully but I stress that the intention of the Government is that if a court has come to a conclusion that custody is not appropriate for a particular young person, it would be extremely rare--although theoretically it is just possible--that custody might then be imposed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I apologise for intervening yet again but in the light of what the noble Lord has said, what effect does he maintain is to be derived from the words in brackets on line 37,

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Section 1 applies in the distinct circumstances set out. The offence or any associated offence is one for which the sentence is fixed by law. The court is not proposing to impose a custodial sentence and was not proposing an absolute discharge. That is the cross-reference to Section 1.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I do not wish to prolong this discussion much longer. However, the Minister should think carefully about this matter. Much as one hopes that the whole matter will be positive for the young person involved, when one thinks of the young people who get into this position there is no question that one of the main questions they will bear in mind is what might happen if they do not do what is stated in the contract. That is the critical point. They will need to know whether there is a possibility of a custodial sentence being imposed. The phrase in their minds will not be the one that the Minister mentioned at the Dispatch Box a moment ago; namely, that a custodial sentence is theoretically possible. I do not think that is of much use to a 14 year-old who has been extremely naughty.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I believe that the points that have been made are perfectly reasonable ones by way of probing and inquiry. I repeat what I said to the noble Viscount earlier. I shall give some thought as to whether the true answer is to reconsider the approach proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, or whether one needs to rely on specific and firm guidance. I take <P>

However, when the Minister reconsiders this matter I hope he will bear in mind that I also want the new system to work. I believe that it stands a good chance of working in a large number of cases. However, I think it will be more likely to work if there is a potential sanction for wasting the panel's time than if there is no sanction at all for so doing. Such a sanction will make the system more likely to work as we all wish.

<A NAME="90201-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. I believe that too much is made of the fact that the measure reduces the courts' sentencing options. I have sat as a magistrate for about 17 years and for some of that time in the youth court. As the Minister quite rightly pointed out, the primary aim is to consider the welfare needs of the youngsters who appear before the court. My amendment has precisely that aim. I accept that we are now discussing a new way of dealing with young offenders. I shall monitor how the courts deal with the provision. That will give us an opportunity to address this issue in future. Overall my analysis and the research evidence clearly indicate that although magistrates have custodial powers at the present time, on average they do not impose a sentence for longer than 2.3 months. Therefore I believed it was necessary to introduce this provision in this part of the Bill. However, as I said, I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cope, as I believe he has raised this question on an earlier occasion. I accept readily that the Bill as currently drafted is not sufficiently explicit as regards the availability of these disposals.

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1323</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disabilities are children first", that principle should apply to 18 year-olds with learning disabilities in this legislation too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-12_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I have my name to one of the amendments in this group. I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. One should of course protect children, no matter what age is defined as the age of maturity. As I understand it, 17-year-olds are still "children", and therefore should be treated as such under this Bill as they are under the Children Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-12_para16"></a>I also find it odd that in the second part of this Bill the age is suddenly reduced to 17; whereas the Long Title of the Bill refers to "offenders under 18". Why is there this sudden change? It does not make sense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-12_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The age limit up to which child witnesses are eligible for assistance from special measures by virtue of their youth is based on the earlier child evidence provisions under the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Under that Act, certain measures are available for children up to the age of 17 in sexual offence cases, and up to 14 in cases involving violence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-12_para17"></a>For the purposes of this Bill, we considered that children under the age of 17 might need the special protection measures in the Bill whatever the alleged offence, simply on the grounds of their youth, and that it would be right to make them eligible for help on that basis and that basis alone.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-12_para18"></a>I accept what has been said or implied. All age limits are to some extent arbitrary. A child can buy cigarettes at 16, drive at 17 but not buy alcohol until he or she is 18. A girl may be criminally responsible at 10, cannot consent to sexual intercourse until 16, but is not adult for the purposes of adult prison until she is 17. So there are varying age limits and, as the noble Lord has indicated, they vary within different jurisdictions in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-12_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, is right. The Children Act 1989 set the age limit for a child at 18. But that age limit was for the purposes of that Act. It has not led to a general re-framing of other legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-12_para20"></a>That does not mean--this is an important point--that a 17 year-old witness cannot have access to special measures. Under Clause 16(1)(b) the Bill allows 17 year-olds to claim eligibility for special measures on the grounds of intimidation, disability or disorder, or the nature or circumstances of the offence, which might otherwise reduce the quality of the evidence that they have to give. So it is not a matter of a non-safeguard for those aged 17-plus.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-12_para21"></a>If a young person has given evidence in chief, or has been cross-examined by way of a video recorded interview, that video recording will continue to be admissible in court even if the young person has passed the age limit in the meantime. And if the young person has the critical birthday in the middle of giving evidence, any special measures granted previously on account of youth will continue to apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-12_para22"></a>Although there is not a perfect symmetry in any of these connections, 17 seems about reasonable, subject to the safeguard to which I have referred. It is not a <P>


<a name="column_1324"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1324</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disqualification thereafter. There are particular safeguards. We have had to set a balance. In our judgment 17 is about right.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for that explanation. I hope that there will be guidance notes to accompany this Act and that the point about safeguards will be clearly identified. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rix </B>   moved Amendment No. 69:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 12, line 30, at end insert--
<BR>
("or both").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: I wish to point out that this piece of legislation displays a tendency towards grouping people into two camps: children who require special measures because they are children; and people with a learning disability or mental health problems who require special measures because of their disability or illness. By adding a provision to indicate that a witness may require special measures because he or she has a learning disability and because he or she is a minor will prevent learning disabled children from falling between those two stools.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para2"></a>I am particularly concerned about 17 year-old witnesses with learning disabilities. I realise that learning disabled children will be included in the legislation under the general heading of "children". However, I feel that there is a need for a positive reinforcement of their presence since they often seem to be invisible in the legal process. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Windlesham: </B>   We have slid seamlessly from youth offender panels on to the totally different and vitally important matter of the conduct of criminal trials and the position of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para3"></a>I wish first to make some general observations on this part of the Bill. I think it is more appropriate to do so on this amendment than on the previous one dealing with the age at which young people can obtain the special protections that the Bill provides.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para4"></a>We can all agree, I hope, that the balance between the interests of victims and the rights of the accused in a criminal trial is uneven. The accused has rights guaranteed by law or procedural rules. It is proper that a defendant should have safeguards against the abuse of power. However, until recently, the interests of the victims, falling short of formal rights in an enforceable sense, were accorded lesser recognition. This part of the Bill is an important step towards re-adjusting that balance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para5"></a>At Second Reading I declared an interest as president of Victim Support. I repeat that declaration now. Since 1991, Victim Support has been creating a national witness service to assist the victims of crime and their families and friends in every Crown Court in the country. I believe that there are now 86 Crown Court centres where Victim Support provides that service. <P>


<a name="column_1325"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1325</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It is funded by the Home Office. A fruitful partnership has been developed, with trained volunteers offering support and information to over 120,000 victims annually before, during and after hearings in court. More recently that has been supplemented with a similar service in 130 magistrates' courts. We are now near the end of what I hope will prove to be positive negotiations with the Government to extend that service to all magistrates' courts. There is thus a realistic prospect of a further extension taking place in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para6"></a>Because of this work, Victim Support, in the person of its highly respected director, Helen Reeves, was the only non-governmental organisation invited to take part in the interdepartmental working party on vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, on whose report this part of the Bill is based. The report was published in June 1998 under the title Speaking Up for Justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para7"></a>It will be no surprise that Victim Support should welcome the potential improvements in the handling of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, although it has made a number of comments. The most important refer to the structure of Clauses 16 and 17, which are the subject of these amendments. They depart from the working party recommendation which would have made eligibility for assistance automatic for all category A witnesses, which is, broadly speaking, those who fall within Clause 16 of the Bill, including witnesses under the age of 17, which was the subject of the previous amendment, and discretionary for category B witnesses, broadly those within the scope of Clause 17 of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para8"></a>My main purpose at this stage, as we begin consideration of these clauses, is to ask the Government to explain their reasons for not following in the drafting of the Bill the approach which was proposed by the working party of their own officials. We may be informed by the noble Lord that it is a matter of drafting, but what appears in the Bill is a far more legalistic approach, turning on the test of "improving"--that word is used in some places--or "not diminishing" the quality of evidence. This is a concept which many victims will find hard to comprehend and it may be that even in this House we shall need some explanation from the Minister in order to understand how the test will be applied in the courts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Perhaps I may deal with the point of the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and two other noble Lords, which is quite short: at page 12, line 30, to include "or both". It is clear in the Bill--and indeed explicit in Clause 21(1)--that the court may consider a witness eligible for assistance on various grounds, and not simply one. Clause 16 merely provides that, if the court is satisfied that a witness fulfils either part of subsection (1), he or she will be eligible to apply for special measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para9"></a>I hope I can give the noble Lords, and in particular the noble Lord, Lord Rix, some comfort by saying unambiguously that I would expect an application made in respect of a child who had a degree of disability to be made under both parts of subsection (1) and for it to set out why the child needs particular measures because of age and disability. The child would then benefit from <P>


<a name="column_1326"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1326</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the presumption under Clause 21 that a video recording of his evidence-in-chief would be admitted and that he would give further evidence by live link. At the same time, the application could set out why different or further special measures might be needed because of the child's disability and would continue to be needed even if he were to reach the age of 17.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para10"></a>I entirely accept that it will be extremely important to ensure that lawyers preparing applications understand that they can be made on several grounds. I believe that that is best achieved through guidance and training.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, generously paid tribute to what the Government have been doing in support of a most worthy organisation, which I personally have supported over many years, and I join with him in his well-deserved tribute to the director, Helen Reeves. He mentioned funding. I believe that the Government have a good record over the past 18 months of increased funding to Victim Support. I think he was putting a fly over my nose to see whether the discussions which he described as positive might not be the subject of an announcement. There will be an announcement quite soon and it is probably left for the Home Secretary to make it. We certainly realise that the role of the victim has been inadequately thought about. Organisations such as the NSPCC have done a good deal along the lines that the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, indicated.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para12"></a>In Speaking Up for Justice it was said that children who may be obviously disadvantaged and those who have a mental or physical disability should automatically have special measures. Paraphrasing the noble Lord rather brutally, his question was, "Why can we not have those measures automatically?" We want to focus the measures on those who really need them so that they will be available only if the court considers that they will improve witnesses' evidence. The court will then have to be careful and discreet in examining which measure, or combination of measures, will best serve the witness's needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para13"></a>My understanding is that those who may have a physical or mental disability, or both, do not wish to have an exclusive list because, whatever one has by way of list, one is bound to leave someone out and second thoughts perhaps make the system inflexible. It will be something of a culture change for many who sit in court, but we want the courts to be much more open-minded and alert to the fact that what the courts want is the best evidence and that simply relying on the procedures of the 19th century, perhaps, is not sufficient. We believe that this provision gives a flexible power to the court. I stress that I believe that guidance, training and encouragement have a good deal to offer.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para14"></a>With specific regard to the amendment, I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, needed it. I think he may well have recognised that he did not need it and I hope that the assurances I have given him have fulfilled his purpose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for those assurances, which I shall be able to read in Hansard tomorrow morning and wave in front of my officials at <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>MENCAP and other organisations. I cannot answer for the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham, for whose broad support on this matter I am grateful, but, with the assurances of the Minister ringing in my ears, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para15"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn </B>   moved Amendment No. 69A:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 12, line 35, leave out ("suffers from") and insert ("has a").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: Grouped with Amendment No. 69A are Amendments Nos. 70 and 87. It is probably helpful if we deal with them all at this stage, because I think that there will be nothing between us. The noble Lords, Lord Rix, Lord Swinfen and Lord Dholakia, wish in Clause 16 on page 12, line 35, to leave out "suffers from" and insert "has". This is not hair splitting; I believe that my amendment is better because it leaves out "suffers from" and inserts "has a". We have produced exactly the same result but I think that the Government have trumped the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and improved on his amendment by introducing the single word "a". That is another step forward. I think my best amendment in the past was to insert "but"; I have got it down from three letters to one.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para17"></a>The approach we adopt with regard to Clause 29 is rather different. The measures in Clause 29 will be available to the group of witnesses who are eligible under Clause 16(2)(a)(ii). They will be available to those who need help because of a disability or disorder under subsection (2)(b) or (2)(a)(i). In those parts of Clause 16 the phrase "suffers from" is to be retained. I understand the reasons why noble Lords have not tabled an amendment to those parts of the clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para18"></a>For some witnesses who are eligible under Clause 16, we think that "suffers from" may well be an appropriate description--for example, for those who suffer from degenerative or progressive disease, or who are undergoing courses of treatment for their condition, or who are suffering "from" a mental disorder.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-13_para19"></a>We have approached this as carefully and thoughtfully as we can. We ought to be comprehensive and consistent in the Bill. I hope that your Lordships will not persist but will withdraw the amendment at Clause 29 and accept the government amendment to Clause 16. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>better than I used in Amendment No. 70. I shall have the greatest possible pleasure in not moving Amendments Nos. 70 and 87.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para0"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rix </B>   moved Amendment No. 71:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 12, line 43, at end insert (", the extent to which the witness requires support and the views of relatives, carers, advocates and other relevant parties").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 71 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 72 and 77 which are grouped with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para2"></a>First, I will say a little about Amendment No. 71. I very much welcome that the Bill makes provision for what may seem to many to be obvious but is often overlooked; namely, that an individual's opinion counts for something. All too often, third parties of one stripe or another confidently claim to have a monopoly on the opinions and expectations of an individual. Within MENCAP there is currently a huge drive towards facilitating self-advocacy. We would like to encourage that in relation to witnesses. However, in many cases, self-advocates still require some support in order to express their views. Without such support they might neither perceive their potential vulnerability nor the possibility of intimidation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para3"></a>Without support, many people with learning disabilities lack the communication skills to make their views known. Without support, they do not understand terms such as "intimidation" or "vulnerability". People with learning disabilities may have difficulty with taking in new information, handling complex material and communicating effectively. They may need support to help them to think of what they want to say, or they may need encouragement to answer a question. For this reason, I would like provision to be made for support at this early stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para4"></a>Without this provision, how can people who may need special assistance because of their difficulty in understanding the formal procedures adopted in court make a sensible judgment about whether or not they will need assistance to participate in these measures?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para5"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 72--and following on from the points that I have just made in connection with Amendment No. 71--I see no reason why people close to the witness cannot be consulted in order to determine whether or not the witness has a learning disability and the extent of that disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para6"></a>As to Amendment No. 77, Clause 20 allows for expert evidence to be marshalled in considering whether a special measures direction should be made available. I am not quite sure what definition of an "expert" the Government have in mind. Is an expert a psychiatrist unknown to the witness, who can be shipped in to make a broad medical assessment of a witness's intellectual impairment, or is he somebody who, in a professional capacity, counsels the individual in the circumstances of his every day life--for example, a social worker or a community health official?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para7"></a>Let us not forget that the eligibility criteria for special measures includes the individual's social functioning as well as his mental capacity. If assessment for special <P>


<a name="column_1329"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1329</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>measures consists of nothing more than labelling somebody's mental age or other general formula, then his actual capacity in relation to the special tasks ahead as a witness is likely to be overlooked.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para8"></a>Sometimes it is worth looking a bit closer to home, which is why I propose a new subsection. Advocates, carers and relatives should be consulted where appropriate. These are the people who are often best placed to understand the more subtle patterns of behaviour and fluctuation in capacity, and to give support to a witness in stressful circumstances. These parties should, however, only be consulted where relevant. I very much appreciate the tensions which can exist in relationships between a person--disabled or otherwise--and those closest to them. But that should not debar the court from taking opportunities to enlist their help where that help is genuinely needed. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am in broad agreement with the purpose of Amendment No. 71, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Rix. However, I think it should be expressed rather differently. It should read,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the extent to which the witness requires support and any views expressed by relatives, carers, advocates and other relevant parties". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
If we do not put it in the way I have suggested, the court will have the rather strange responsibility of gathering up the various people mentioned, which it may find very difficult to do. If, on the other hand,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"relatives, carers, advocates and other relevant parties", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
are in touch with the witness about the matter, then they can come to the court and express their views. Although the noble Lord's purpose is very commendable and necessary, it must be expressed differently. In his other two amendments, the purpose is expressed in a way that is acceptable. There it reads "the evidence of" in each case, and that makes it quite clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Windlesham: </B>   Before the noble Lord replies, I wish to raise a small point following on from what the noble Lord, Lord Renton, has said. Perhaps the noble Lord will ask the draftsman to consider whether the word "views" has the precision of meaning which one hopes to find on the statute book. I do not have an alternative suggestion, but "views" is surely diffuse and imprecise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I rise briefly to support this group of amendments, with which I have great sympathy. Obviously I take into account what my noble friends have said about the detailed wording.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para9"></a>I wish to make an additional point. In these circumstances it seems that helping and supporting the witness in this way actually helps the court to arrive at the right conclusion in the case that it is considering. It is not just a question of being sympathetic to a witness who may have been a victim of crime, but of getting at the truth and getting the right decision in court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   This Bill seeks to achieve justice. Young people with mental disability need the support of <P>


<a name="column_1330"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1330</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those whom they know and are confident with rather than strange experts, by which I mean those strange to them. It is important to bear in mind that a number of these young people may also have a speech impediment and only those who are close to them may understand them. I strongly support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, even though it may require improvement in the way suggested by my noble friend Lord Renton.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Not for the first time I am in absolute agreement with the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley. The object is to obtain the best possible evidence for the court and the provision is there in the pursuit of justice. We have come to this particular area of evidential law and practice very late in the day. I fully appreciate that these amendments are designed to ensure that the court takes account of the views held by a witness's relatives, supporters, carers, advocates and other relevant parties. I believe that I can live with "views". I am not sure of the extent to which that differs from "opinions", although opinions sometimes come in expert form and are expensive, whereas the views of relatives and parents are perhaps more persuasive and are free.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para10"></a>Therefore, the views and opinions are directed at the extent to which the nature of the disability or disorder as defined in subsection (2) is likely to diminish the quality of the individual's evidence. Where these are relevant to the court's decision it will take them into account. I do not however believe that it needs to be on the face of the Bill and perhaps I may spend a moment or two on the reasons why. In most cases the parties to any proceedings will have determined at a relatively early stage the witnesses they will or may want to call. If either party considers that one of its witnesses needs special measures under Clause 19 it must prepare and make an application to the court. One must carefully bear in mind that Clause 19(1)(b) gives the court power of its own motion to raise the issue as to whether such a direction should be given. The application must set out the reasons why the witness should be considered eligible for special measures and what measures would be likely to improve the witness's evidence. That can include a family member who deals with someone with a speech disability because the ordinary interpreter (as we should regard such a person) will do a good deal less satisfactory piece of work than someone who knows the individual in question, can calm him, reaffirm the trust between them and give much more effective, practical help to the court. I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para11"></a>In preparing the application there will have been discussions with the witness and, where appropriate, one or more of the witness's relatives, supporters, friends or any other relevant person who can advise on the help that the witness is likely to need. That may well be the help described by the noble Lord. One must bear in mind that the witness may well have his own views and may not want assistance from relatives. One must not fall into the trap of which the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has warned us in the past, rightly, and take away decision and individual judgment from someone simply because <P>


<a name="column_1331"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1331</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>he has a disability. He may not want his relatives to assist him. Many witnesses with disabilities are perfectly able to speak for themselves and, much more importantly, may well want to do so. The court should take account of those views in its decision on eligibility and the measures to be provided under Clauses 16(4), 17(3) and 19(3)(a).
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para12"></a>If one has a very young or deeply handicapped witness a relative, supporter or carer may be a better advocate for the witness's needs than the witness himself. There is nothing to prevent any of the parties suggesting to the court, or the court deciding on its own motion, that it should hear the views of a relative or carer. We must allow the court flexible discretion in a particular case. I am happy to underline to the Committee the existing common law powers that allow the court to hear evidence of such views whenever it sees fit. Therefore, the discretion is already there.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para13"></a>A second effect of Amendment No. 71 is to require the court to consider the extent to which a witness requires support when it determines whether or not he is eligible under Clause 16(1)(b). This is not necessary. The court is already required under that subsection to consider whether the quality of a witness's evidence is likely to be diminished by disability or disorder. Under Clause 19 it is required to consider whether any of the special measures would be likely to improve or maximise the quality of the witness's evidence. These provisions constitute a duty on the court to consider whether the witness requires support from a special measure in order to give his best evidence, as the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, suggested.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-14_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, helpfully drew attention to the question of different provisions for experts. That is not in any way intended to imply that an expert is better than a parent, carer, relative or friend. It simply falls in the context of the making of rules of court. The making of rules of court relates simply to the provision of expert evidence, in the way that there is now provision for expert evidence in many cases and no particular provision is made for an ordinary lay witness. An expert witness is anyone whose credentials satisfy the court whether because of academic qualification or expertise. As the noble Lord, Lord Rix, suggested, the expert may well be a psychiatrist who perhaps knows the consequences of the disability of the particular individual. Therefore, Clause 20(6) does not attempt to imply that an expert is better, but is simply a provision for making rules of court for the practical disposal of court business.

<A NAME="90201-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord. There is no reason why Victim Support or any other caring organisation whether or not in loco parentis should not notify the court. That has been my experience in the past where similar organisations which are not in a quasi-parental or caring relationship have been helpful, but I undertake to check the matter further. Based on past experience I believe that that is the position, as the noble and learned Lord has correctly pointed out.

<A NAME="90201-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   With the assurance that the Minister has just given the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, with the proviso that I should like to read most carefully the Minister's very generous response to see whether or not it is necessary to contact his department again before the Bill reaches its next stage. On the basis of the assurances just given in the noble Lord's summing up, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

("( ) The court must state in open court its reasons for refusing an application that a witness falls within subsection (2)(a).").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: I am sure that distinguished members of the judiciary in England and Wales--a number of whom I am happy to say are present in the Chamber--will be fully supportive in assisting both defendants and witnesses in the granting of dispensations for special measures where appropriate. However, one must guard against the rejection of special measures on principle, whatever the principle might be, or without due consideration of the specific requirements of the individual.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para3"></a>While Clause 20 stipulates that a court must give its reasons for refusing an application for a special direction, there is no requirement on the court to state in open court its reasons for refusing an application for special measures on the ground of intellectual impairment. I envisage judges doing so as a matter of course but I should like to ensure that the process is open and transparent. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My name is also to the amendment and I support it. I should have thought it essential to make certain that the court is accountable, and accountable to the public, which all courts must be. Such a provision may also be useful to a higher court should the case go to appeal at a later stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I accept that. That means it would be inevitable that a court making such a decision and determination would feel obliged to specify its reasons in open court. I think that any judge who did not do that would be swiftly and severely rebuked by a higher court of appeal.

<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para5"></a>I entirely accept that if witnesses are to have faith in the new system it is important for the courts to be clear about their reasons for refusing applications for special measures, in particular if a court accepts that a witness has a disability but does not accept that special measures would improve the quality of the evidence.

<A NAME = "90201-15_para9"></a>Clause 17 [Witnesses eligible for assistance on grounds of fear or distress about testifying]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley </B>   moved Amendment No. 73A:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 13, line 32, leave out from ("section") to end of line 34 and insert ("if he requests such treatment").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 17 brings us to the question of witnesses who are vulnerable because of fear or distress for various reasons in any type of case. In those circumstances any witness can have the protections, the special measures, provided by the Bill--screens, or whatever is appropriate to his case. I think that we are all in agreement on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para11"></a>The amendment draws attention to subsection (4) of Clause 17 which makes special provision about complainants in sexual offence cases. As drafted, subsection (4) provides that such complainants will have such protection unless the court thinks that their evidence will not suffer by reason of their fear or distress as set out in subsection (1).
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para12"></a>If the court thinks that their evidence will suffer, as described in subsection (1), they are eligible anyway. The subsection therefore at first sight appeared to achieve nothing. Complainants are either eligible under subsection (1) or they are not. But that makes one wonder why subsection (4) is in the Bill. I presume that someone asked himself the question as to whether complainants in sexual offences cases need special eligibility for protection even if the subsection does not provide it. If we fully trusted the courts, the provision would be totally unnecessary. However, by inserting a subsection along these lines, it makes clear Parliament's will that complainants in sexual offence cases should be especially eligible, even though the detailed provisions do not provide that.
<P>


<a name="column_1334"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1334</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para13"></a>However, what special eligibility should complainants in sexual offence cases have for the measures set out? It seemed worth considering adjusting subsection (4) to provide that those complainants should have protection if they want it. In other cases it would be the court's discretion. In the case of vulnerable witnesses the court would wish normally to grant the application where those witnesses were frightened or in distress and unlikely to give good evidence on that account. But it would be the court's decision. However, in order to draw special attention in the case of sexual offences, we might wish to provide that it would be the complainant's decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para14"></a>Clause 19 (1) makes clear that parties to the proceedings--they presumably include the complainant and the prosecution--can request special measures; it is not always up to the court. The amendment provides that if a complainant in a sexual offence case requests the special measure, it should follow automatically. There is no doubt that fear and distress can be very great. We have read about that; no doubt some Members of the Committee have seen that in courts. I am not against drawing special attention to those cases. I do not believe that subsection (4) does so satisfactorily. I believe that Amendment No. 73A provides a better way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I regret that I have to oppose the amendment. In subsection (1) there is a burden upon a party who is calling a witness to satisfy the court that that witness is likely to give evidence which will be diminished by reason of fear or distress. The burden is on a balance of probabilities because the word "likely" is used. However, in subsection (4) there is a presumption in the case of a complainant that that person is eligible for assistance. It would be for the other party to convince the court on balance of probabilities that subsection (1) does not apply. Therefore there is a marked distinction as to where the burden of proving the issue lies between those two sections.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para15"></a>However, that is not the reason that I oppose the amendment. The tradition of criminal trials in this country is that they should be held openly; that the accuser and accused and their witnesses should be seen and heard on an equal footing. Over the years we have recognised that some vulnerable people require special protection. But a balance has to be sought in deciding the appropriate way to deal with vulnerable witnesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para16"></a>Stress is inevitable in the trial process. Any person who goes into court in any capacity, whether it be the judge, the jury, the advocates or the witnesses, is subject to a degree of stress. That is part of the process by which the truth ultimately emerges through our adversarial procedures. While it may be right to give special protection to people who are shown to be vulnerable, as these special measures do, one cannot take that too far. What is suggested by this amendment is that any complainant, however robust they may be in their personality, can, at their own request, require special measures. I find that dangerous.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para17"></a>Why do I find that so? It is easier to maintain a false story behind a screen or at the other end of a video link than it is to go into the witness box and confront the <P>


<a name="column_1335"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1335</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>person against whom one makes allegations. To my mind, one can "cotton-wool" too much. If there are vulnerable witnesses, certainly there should be special measures, but if they are not vulnerable, let the traditions of fair and open trial in this country remain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-15_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Under the Bill at present, as it has been rightly said, complainants in sexual offence cases will be presumed to be eligible for assistance unless the court is satisfied that they are not.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para18"></a>Therefore, the court will have to consider whether the witness's evidence is likely to be diminished by fear or distress. If it considers that the witness's evidence will not be affected, having considered the witness's own views under subsection (3), then it will decide that the witness is not eligible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para19"></a>We expect that unless the witness satisfies the court that he or she does not need help, he or she is likely to be deemed eligible. It is then for the court to consider, on application, whether and which special measures would help.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para20"></a>There may well be cases where the court wishes to dissent from the witness's views, perhaps because of representations made by the prosecution or the defence. The court needs to keep proper control of the proceedings. We believe that it is important that the witness's views should not be paramount.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para21"></a>The effect of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Cope, would be to make the witness's views the only consideration for the court. It would remove the court's discretion to decide whether the witness was eligible for assistance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-15_para22"></a>Perhaps we may take the case of someone who is genuinely in fear or distress. That may well be such that the witness does not want to express it and seeks the protection of the special measures. The prosecution or the defence may well have other material extraneous to the witness's own request, which may well be compelling. I do not believe that the noble Lord's amendment deals with that situation at all. As a matter of principle, it should be for the court to decide whether a witness is eligible for assistance and not the witness, because I do not believe that the witness's determinative choice would be in the interests of the trial process. It seems to us that we have got it right in the current provision: those who need help are considered eligible for help while preserving the court's overall discretion. Having reflected on the way in which I have put the matter, I hope that the noble Lord will come to a different conclusion.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I do not believe that I have been so knee-deep in paper since we were re-writing the last act of "Dry Rot" one hour before the curtain went up on the first night. In moving this amendment I am delighted that the Home Office secured an early legislative opportunity to advance the protection of vulnerable witnesses. I fully support the principles of this Bill. Once on the statute book this legislation should accelerate the implementation of the broader proposals contained within the earlier consultation paper Speaking Up For Justice, which deals with every aspect of the judicial process from the first stage of reporting a crime to the police to the court room and beyond. I am aware that excellent work is going on behind the scenes in bringing all these measures to fruition although it is clear that some will take longer than others.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para4"></a>For instance, the removal of wigs or robes will come into force nationally as a special measure the day after this Bill becomes law. Others, such as the use of intermediaries, will require careful piloting and evaluation over time before full implementation can be considered. Nevertheless, it would be reassuring to know that the Government have an end date in mind for the culmination of their implementation strategy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para5"></a>This amendment seeks clarification on the timetable leading to the introduction of new measures. The Government want to pilot these measures. When will the pilots begin? How long will the pilots last and on what date will the special measures be implemented nationally? If a date has not already been set, perhaps consideration should be given to 1st January 2000 as proposed in my amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para6"></a>Perhaps I may also raise the question of how the Government envisage tackling situations which may arise where a witness requires special measures in court, which are only available in court rooms in another county. I raise that point because the experience of giving evidence may be extremely traumatic for some people with learning disabilities. I fear that relocation will only add to the trauma. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has pointed out, Part II of the Bill gives effect to a very large number of recommendations made in the Speaking Up For Justice report. It is 26. The implementation is considered as part of the wider programme of reform of the way in which our criminal justice system treats vulnerable witnesses.
<P>


<a name="column_1337"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1337</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para7"></a>We have a steering group set up to oversee the implementation of all the recommendations in Speaking Up For Justice, not simply the 26 in the Bill, but the other recommendations as well. We hope that the implementation programme will be ready before the summer.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para8"></a>Some of the legislative and non-legislative changes are, of course, inter-dependent. We want to identify witnesses early on who need help and then treat them appropriately thereafter. It is not realistic to think that everything in the Bill can be brought into force by the end of the year. In many cases I believe that it should not. We know only too well that poorly implemented legislation is almost as bad as no legislation at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para9"></a>There is an enormous task as regards training guidance needed to ensure that all criminal justice practitioners, not simply those who sit as magistrates or judges, are able to use the new provisions. Some of the special measures mean buying or hiring special equipment like video and live link facilities. That cannot begin until after Royal Assent. There are some ideas in the Bill, as regards video recorded cross-examination, that have never been tried. Several Members of the Committee have expressed concern as to how they will work in practice. We need to implement them quite carefully.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para10"></a>Perhaps I may assist the noble Lord, Lord Rix, in one or two ways. The new measures to help witnesses will cost about &#163;6.3 million. The cost of preparing applications for witnesses who need measures will be about &#163;1.7 million--I have rounded that up slightly. That is per year. The use of live-link evidence will cost about &#163;1.8 million over 10 years. The cost to the CPS applying for live links will be about &#163;348,000. The cost of CPS video recorded evidence-in-chief will be about &#163;683,000 per year. So quite significant costs are involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para11"></a>That is not used to indicate that we are not wholly committed to the purposes and principles of this Bill. I am simply giving those figures to reassure the noble Lord, and others who share his concerns, that we mean to implement this Bill and to put the measures in place. There is quite a lot of work to be done. I have given the figures only to indicate that there is significant work to be done and it could not usefully be done were we to have a timescale as rigid as 1st January 2000. But I assure the noble Lord that we mean to get on with this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I recognise that 1st January 2000 is only a short time away, as I am sure we are all only too well aware. I am glad to have the Minister's assurance that the costs for ensuring justice for people with learning disabilities do not enter into the Government's thinking. With that assurance ringing in my mind and, I am sure, the belief that all these measures will be implemented as soon as is humanly possible, without reference to the costing, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para16"></a>The amendment is intended to draw out whether other parties to the proceedings may say whether they believe that special measures are not required. It is not difficult to imagine a witness thinking that it would gain sympathy with the jury if there were special measures of one sort or another. It may be difficult in such circumstances for the court to refuse. However, the defendant or people acting for him may wish to express a view.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para17"></a>It may be that another part of the Bill makes that possible and my amendment may be unnecessary. I infer from the reference in Clause 20 to "uncontested applications" in that context that those applications can be contested but I am not clear as to how that can be done unless my amendment is accepted.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para18"></a>However, I am encouraged also by government Amendment No. 75A, which is grouped with this amendment. That refers to the next clause.

Those subsections require the court to determine whether any of the available measures would, in the court's opinion, be likely to improve the quality of evidence given by a witness, and then to determine which measures would be likely to maximise the quality of the evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-16_para19"></a>The court has to consider all the circumstances of the case. The views expressed by the witnesses are only one circumstance to be considered. The court must consider also whether that special measure may,
<P>

<A NAME="90201-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am extremely grateful for that. It would trouble me in particular, since I was a trustee of the society until the election intervened, if those were the consequences. I shall look at that with particular care with officials and I undertake to write to the noble Lord in the way that he has generously suggested.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-17_para0"></a>I should say in response to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that we expect that applications would be made inter partes. However, I do not wish to mislead the Committee. Clause 20(6)(d) enables rules of court to make provision for confidential, sensitive information to be used for such an application and that is allowed to be withheld from any party to the proceedings. It is possible, in rare cases, that such information may well be legitimately necessary for such applications. I must sound that cautionary note because the noble Lord and I will know of some cases which we can easily remember where that may be a proper safeguard. But I agree with the general proposition that those matters should be inter partes.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-17_para1"></a>I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Cope. I believe that it is better dealt with by my Amendment No. 75A to Clause 20. It is important to have a statutory requirement for the court to take into account what measures a witness says he would find useful. The court must be required to consider whether a special measure will inhibit a party's ability effectively to test the witness's evidence. That normally means asking the parties for their views.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-17_para2"></a>We do not need an additional requirement to consider the views of every part to the proceedings. In practice, it will usually have considered the views of the party calling the witness and making the application. In the course of considering whether the measures will make it difficult for any party to test the witness's evidence effectively, it will have to consider any other party's views if the witness is relevant to the case against that party. There is nothing to prevent the court seeking any party's views at any time, if it wishes to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-17_para3"></a>If a court decided to make a special measures direction of its own motion, I should certainly expect it to consult the party calling the witness as well as the witness and the other party.

<P>

<A NAME = "90201-17_para5"></a>Liberty and, separately, the Guild of Editors have suggested to me that either party should be allowed to apply for a special measures direction to be varied or discharged if the party is aware that there has been a material change of circumstance since the direction was made or was last made. Having thought about it, I believe they are right. There should be equality of arms, as it were, between the parties. My amendment will achieve that. I am grateful to those who have brought the matter to my attention. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment as not being necessary in the light of my explanation and I ask the Committee to accept my amendment because I believe that it does justice to both parties when there has been a supervening change of circumstance.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Before my noble friend decides what to do with his amendment, perhaps I may make a request of the Minister. When he replies about the NSPCC submission, will he send copies to other noble Lords? He did so previously and it was a great help. What the NSPCC says about Clause 19(2) and (3) is extremely disturbing. I wish to be certain that the noble Lord is right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The noble Baroness is right. I did not say so on this occasion, but my invariable practice is not only to write to the noble Lord who raises the issue but to all other Peers who have participated in the debate or similar debates. I always place a copy in the Library, too. I should have said that, but perhaps your Lordships would take it as read in connection with any undertaking about letter writing that I give.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I support the improvement to Clause 20 as suggested by the Minister and the government amendment. I am not sure why my amendment to Clause 19 is not also necessary, but I can see that the court must consider all the circumstances of the case. I suppose that that covers the matter sufficiently. Having had the Minister's reassurance that my amendment is unnecessary, I beg leave to withdraw it.

Page 15, line 4, leave out ("might tend to") and insert ("will").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-17_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 75, I am aware that in providing special measures for witnesses the court must primarily focus on the necessity for quality evidence and, as a corollary, on the circumstances and requirements of the individual witness. However, I have concerns that Clause 19(3)(b), which allows the judge to rule out the use of special measures on the grounds that they might tend to inhibit the quality of evidence, could be used inappropriately either on grounds of principled objection to the use of special measures or through misinformation about the likely impact of special measures. The language in the clause could be tightened up simply, but with important <P>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1341</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>effect. The Minister has already corrected my English and I hope that he will allow me to correct the English in the Bill. My amendment suggests that rejecting special measures on the basis that they "might tend to" inhibit such evidence is not ground enough. Rather, special measures should be ruled out only if the measures "will", with a greater degree of certainty, inhibit the evidence. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I support the amendment because I believe that it is more in keeping with the spirit of the legislation than the words in the Bill. Where an eligible witness is the main witness for the prosecution, and without whose evidence the prosecution will fail, I would not put it past a clever lawyer to argue that the words "might tend to" are appropriate in his case and rule him out so that he could not give evidence with the necessary support. It would be much more difficult for a lawyer to do so if the word "will" were inserted. It would strengthen the case and strengthen the court's hands.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   We return to the balance drawn to our attention by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. We must not go too far in attending to the needs of a particular class of witnesses but not constantly bearing in mind the needs of the defendant and his witnesses in a criminal case. I understand the spirit behind the amendment, although I have to dissent, but if it were accepted the court would have to be sure that giving any special measure to a witness would inhibit the ability of the other party in the proceedings to test that witness's evidence before it could refuse the measure.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-17_para8"></a>Clause 19(3)(b) allows the court the discretion not to award a measure or measures if it considers that there is a marked possibility that it would inhibit the witness's evidence from being properly tested; in other words, "might tend to inhibit". That is a fair balancing act, bearing in mind that not all defendants are guilty simply because they are accused. The purpose of an adversarial trial in public is to protect the defendant's rights as well as to be tender about the rights of the complainant and the witnesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-17_para9"></a>We believe that this balancing act needs to be sustained. The adoption of a further inhibition in the terms put forward by the noble Lord goes too far the other way. If the court has any doubts about whether it is possible adequately to test a witness's evidence, if evidence is to be given with the assistance of a special measure, it should not award the measure.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-17_para10"></a>I believe that such conflicts of interest would be rare. The measures are designed to include the quality of a witness's evidence, but they are not designed to prevent the evidence he gives from being challenged. I do not believe that we should go as far as the noble Lord, Lord Rix, goes in the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I have no wish to push the Minister off the tightrope in his balancing act at this stage. I should like to read his response in Hansard and consult with <P>

<A NAME = "90201-17_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: Without wishing to make the application process for special measures unduly bureaucratic, it seems to me quite straightforward for the court to reconsider at least once any application for special measures which has been rejected. It is unlikely that potential witnesses will pluck their desire for special measures out of thin air. More often than not, the needs will have been identified earlier and support will have been provided during the police and CPS processes. If needs have been identified earlier, it makes sense to offer continuity of provision throughout the justice system. Therefore, if support were denied at this last hurdle it might be sensible for the court to reconsider. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I cannot accept the amendment. I know that it is well-intentioned, but I believe that the consequences would be adverse. Clause 20(6) is intended to enable the rules of court to stop parties from renewing applications for special measures once the court has turned them down. The exception, quite rightly, is where there has been a material change of circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-18_para0"></a>Applications for special measures will normally be made at a pre-trial hearing. It is very important that any directions made about special measures to be used at the trial should be binding. The purpose of this is to ensure as far as we can that the witness will know before the trial how he will be giving evidence and will be able to prepare himself appropriately. The judge must take into account more than simply the witness's circumstances. He must decide whether those circumstances will have an effect on the quality of the witness's evidence; whether the measures proposed will be able to improve the evidence; and whether special measures might inhibit the ability of other parties to test the evidence effectively. Therefore, there may be a number of good reasons to refuse an application for special measures not related to the witness's disability or distress.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-18_para1"></a>We do not think it right that the parties should be able to renew applications simply because they do not like the decision. It will delay the trial, which is a vice, and more importantly and fundamentally, it will be confusing and distressing for the witnesses. The first application should be the last application unless there is an actual change in circumstance which means that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>different measures might be needed or that the court might sensibly take a different view. I am sorry to put this quite so plainly, but I think the noble Lord's amendment will do a great deal of damage to those who need protection.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-18_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   May I ask the noble Lord a question? "A material change of circumstances" normally in law, I think, means something that has happened since the application was made and not facts that were available at the time of the application. Supposing the facts had not been fully laid before the court on the first occasion, perhaps because the witness had a disability or through fear did not really explain the situation properly. Should it not perhaps say whether there has been a change in the circumstances which were put before the court on a prior occasion, to allow for the situation where there were facts which the court did not know about but which do not technically amount to a change of circumstances because they have not occurred since the application was made?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   That is certainly a point which I will consider. However, I do not want to be in a position of allowing, encouraging or enticing those who make applications simply to be able not to place the circumstances upon which they rely fully before the magistrates or before the judge at a pre-trial hearing on the basis that they can say "Well, we did not have this information available and this is a material change of circumstance". I will certainly look at that, but at the moment, subject to reviewing the point that the noble Viscount has made, I think that the present formulation is right. I will certainly look at it again, but without any undertaking, because I think we have got it right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I should hate to cause any damage to court proceedings with regard to people with a disability and others, as indicated by the Minister. I am of course delighted that he is prepared to look at these slight alterations to a part of Clause 26 and no doubt we shall see signs of this at the next stage of the Bill. With that in mind, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1344</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>brevity on this occasion. I wonder, however, if I may just make a few more comments on this. I think that in all circumstances we must not fetter the discretion of the court to do whatever justice requires in the infinitely variable circumstances which can arise, many of which are unforeseeable. If we are in doubt we should always give the court a discretion, and I think that this amendment is therefore an important one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, was indeed extremely brief and perhaps, because of that brevity, he did not make an additional point which has occurred to me--but knowing his expertise, it may also be that it is not a very good point! It seemed to me that subsection (5), to which all this is subject, does indeed give a good deal of discretion to the court and goes a long way towards saying "may". Therefore, it would be much better if the word "may" was inserted as the noble and learned Lord suggested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   I should like to suggest that we do not pursue this particular amendment and I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that for 10 years there have been on the statute book provisions in relation to video-taped evidence by children. It seems to me that the Bill as drafted gives a pretty clear message about the will of Parliament in this kind of area. Perhaps I may draw your Lordships' attention to a point that I made at Second Reading. It is worth bearing in mind a Home Office police research report published in 1996. It found, and I quote,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There now appears to be considerable reluctance on the part of judges to allow video evidence and interviews to be used." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I suggest that we need to stick to the wording in this particular Bill because this Bill is actually about ensuring that the courts give adequate protection to vulnerable children, particularly in cases involving sexual abuse. I suggest that this amendment would actually weaken that kind of protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-18_para7"></a>I draw your Lordships' attention also to some of the statistics that I quoted at Second Reading. I will not repeat them, other than to show that prosecutions for sexual abuse of children of one kind or another dropped very dramatically between 1985 and 1995, when the Pigot recommendations were in force. I suggest to your Lordships that this actually demonstrates that there might perhaps be some lack of enthusiasm on the part of some courts for admitting video-taped evidence. If I may, I would suggest that we keep to the working of the Bill as presently framed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   As the noble Lord says, Clause 21 creates the presumption that witnesses under 17 will give their evidence-in-chief by means of a video recording made before trial and any further evidence at the trial will be given by live television link.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-18_para8"></a>The court cannot, on the current drafting, dispense with these measures unless it is satisfied that they would not improve the completeness, coherence and accuracy of the child's evidence. This amendment, if carried, would dispense with this presumption, making the arrangements merely a possibility for the court to consider.
<P>


<a name="column_1345"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1345</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-18_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Warner, is quite right that this would undermine arrangements for child witnesses which have been in place since 1992, because they were inserted by the Act of 1991 in the Criminal Justice Act of 1988. Since that time which, as the noble Lord said, is several years ago, it has become increasingly common for child witnesses to give their evidence-in-chief on video soon after the alleged offence has taken place. A child's memory is often fresher at that stage and it reduces the number of times a child must be taken through his evidence, and the less formal setting outside the court can mean that the child is more relaxed and able--this is the important aspect--to give better evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-18_para10"></a>Since the amendments to the Act of 1988, many children have benefited by giving evidence at trial by live link away from the intimidating setting of the court and away from those who are sometimes unsympathetic and sometimes hostile. Until now, live link has been available mainly for children in cases of sexual offence or physical assault allegations. We believe the measures should become the norm for all child witnesses. We live, after all, in a visually literate society, which is well used to the medium.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-18_para11"></a>The Bill therefore creates the presumption that all child witnesses who are called to give evidence should be able to do so by video-recorded evidence and live link, no matter what the offence being tried, unless the court is satisfied that the measure is not needed by the witness. The importance of Clause 21 and its present presumption is that it gives those working with children confidence to make a video recording of evidence-in-chief in the expectation that it will be admitted; it will give a child some certainty about how he will give evidence at trial. Everyone who has worked with children in these circumstances knows that one of the terrible burdens we put upon them is the burden of uncertainty--how the child is to give evidence very often many months after the alleged incident, and many months to a child of tender years is a lifetime.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-18_para12"></a>We recognise that we need certain exceptions. If the court can be satisfied the witness does not need the measures, it will not have to award them. That applies if the court considers that other measures would meet the child's needs or that the child did not need any measures at all. Of course, the overarch is that the court can still exclude a video recording or part of it if it considers that would be in the interests of justice or because proper procedures and rules had not been followed when it was made.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-18_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, indicated earlier--I agree with him--that the court process is stressful for judges, for practitioners and for advocates. But we need to bear in mind that a child is not just a small adult; it has different needs that we have overlooked for far too long. We are therefore adamant in our view that this clause is properly drafted for the circumstances with which we deal.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para5"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving Amendment No. 79A I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 79C and 80A.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para6"></a>These amendments derive from concerns expressed by the Guild of Editors--an institution which represents 300 editors of national and regional newspapers as well as its editorial counterparts in commercial broadcasting and the new media. Its interest in the Bill relates to new reporting restrictions and extended statutory powers of the court to exclude the press from the courtroom.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para7"></a>The guild feels that if the current restrictions are not amended, it could have an unintended but disproportionate and unnecessarily highly restrictive effect upon the publication of matters of public interest; for example, for police to appeal to the public in murder inquiries. They could also impede the proper application of the open justice principle and discourage reports of legal proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para8"></a>Some proposals, such as the extension of anonymity for under 18 year-olds beyond the restrictions of Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act, predate the current Government. The guild welcomes attempts to curb abuse of the new provisions which appear on the face of the Bill and within the Explanatory Notes. However, the Bill will still unduly curb previously lawful publication unless amendments are made. Even then, those will have to be backed by Statements in Parliament by the Minister and perhaps guidance to the courts.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para9"></a>Editors continually rely on the court's discretion to allow them to demonstrate that the parties, clerk, judiciary or Bench have misinterpreted or misapplied the law or ignored precedent, and thereupon persuade the courts that orders restricting reporting should be modified or lifted. The guild feels that the proposals in the Bill will be easily exploited to protect those who find publicity embarrassing instead of vulnerable witnesses being protected, as is intended.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para10"></a>It seems likely that the special measures directions will be routinely deployed in the courts, given their applications to proceedings in respect of sexual offences and those involving 17 year-olds. Editors have no doubt <P>


<a name="column_1347"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1347</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the alacrity with which applications will be made for the protection of witnesses, particularly parties who appreciate the potential for the avoidance of adverse publicity if the press and public are cleared from the court and there is no danger of any report of a failed application until the determination of proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para11"></a>We suggest that open justice safeguards should be included in the Bill to preserve public scrutiny of legal proceedings and the communication of an account of the proceedings to the wider public by the media. We suggest that the Bill ought expressly to provide that the press and the public should be able to see and, more importantly, hear the evidence given by live link. Unless the Bill is amended courts may consider that the press and public presence is optional. The Bill ought to provide that the press and public ought to be able to attend the court and hear evidence given by means of a live link if and when the court has moved to another place which has facilities for live linkage which the normal courtroom lacks. Provision should be made to ensure that the press and public can view and hear any video-recorded examination or re-examination.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para12"></a>The guild also fears that Clause 24 will be exploited to avoid embarrassing publicity providing an easier route to the in-camera proceedings than current measures. We find it difficult to understand why the presence of the media's representatives is likely to intimidate a witness in connection with the proceedings or would facilitate such intimidation. I understand that current powers of punishment for contempt of reporting restrictions under Sections 4(2) and 11 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 would presumably meet many of the potential concerns. The power to exclude the press and the public should not be routinely used in all cases of sexual offences. Complainants automatically enjoy anonymity under the law and protection under media codes. The scope for contentious cross-examination and any fear of consequent salacious reporting is reduced by the Bill's provisions in Chapters II and III.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para13"></a>It is welcomed that the Explanatory Notes contain the statement:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is expected that the press would normally be allowed to remain". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It is important that the press, as the public's representative, be permitted to remain in order to retain the element of public scrutiny which is essential to open justice. Exclusion would run counter to past practice and be inconsistent. For example, the press have the statutory right to attend youth court proceedings, so it makes little sense to create an anomaly and enable their exclusion when under 17 year-olds appear before adult courts. The courts may also permit the press to stay in the absence of the jury and the rest of the public in other circumstances without prejudice to the proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para14"></a>The guild fears that the new power creates a precedent for a routine departure from the open justice principle. We suggest that the Bill could be amended to limit expressly the circumstances in which the press can be excluded. Currently the wording could be interpreted by the court as requiring the opposite. By singling out some media representatives for exclusion, the Bill unfairly excludes newspapers and news agencies but, interestingly enough, not television or the new media or <P>


<a name="column_1348"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1348</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>magazine journalists or, indeed, authors. In any event, exclusion suggests that the real object of the provision is to restrict publication even in the circumstances where the current powers, and those in Chapter IV of the Bill, would not be justified. I do not believe that is the Government's intention.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para15"></a>The media and other parties ought to be given the statutory right to challenge applications to exclude them. The restriction of the rights of parties, or the court of its own motion, is inconsistent with the provisions introduced to meet this country's obligation under Articles 6 and 13 of the ECHR by the Crown Court Rules Act, as amended.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para16"></a>Either party might seek to use Clause 24 to avoid embarrassing publicity, although the witnesses in question, including the complainant, might well wish to present their case in open court, and, in the case of complainants of sexual offences, might well be prepared to waive anonymity as well. It is possible that schools, public institutions, public services as well as defendants whose care and conduct may be called into question would prefer that young complainants of abuse or assault should not have an opportunity for their accusations to be stated in open court. Applications may be motivated by the desire to limit embarrassing publicity indirectly, although presented as applications in the complainants' best interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para17"></a>We believe that there is a danger of creeping secrecy. That is intensified by the possibility of rules of court enabling exclusion orders to be made without a hearing and through the non-disclosure of sensitive and confidential material. It would be helpful if the Government could clarify whether charges left on file would mean that the proceedings had been determined. Will guidance be given on the scope of the binding effect of directions? Does a direction made by one court automatically bind all others; for example, if cases pass from the magistrates' courts to the Crown Court or from any court to an appellate court.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para18"></a>Media publications which fairly and accurately report proceedings in open court enjoy statutory and common law defences in defamation and contempt. The Defamation Act 1996 reaffirmed Parliament's support by extending the defence of absolute privilege. The Bill deprives the press of the benefit of such statutory defence in common law counterparts. We believe that the Bill should ensure that the press and public can hear and view live-link and video-recorded evidence at the same time as the jury as part of open court proceedings. Also, the public should have access to transcripts of evidence. That ought to be introduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para19"></a>If the public and press are excluded from the court, the statutory defences of the Contempt of Court Act and Defamation Act 1996 will not apply to media reports. That may mean that the press will be wary of reporting anything said by the witness, even if no reporting restrictions are made. That could mean that only the other party's case, including all other evidence which discredits the witness, without the witness's rebuttal, is fully reported. Presumably, that could act as a disincentive to the witness. Alternatively, because in the case of a party who called the witness, the proceedings <P>


<a name="column_1349"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1349</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cannot be reported fairly--for example, the alleged victim's version cannot be reported properly, and only that of the alleged perpetrator--the media may decide that it becomes impossible to produce a fair and accurate report of the proceedings as a whole and instead produce a brief report or no report at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para20"></a>Loss of opportunity to give evidence in public due to another's application will also prevent matters of importance reaching the public domain without threat of libel action. The effect of the restrictions might be lessened by ensuring that transcripts are available to the press, with an extension of appropriate defences to protect fair and accurate reporting of their contents.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-19_para21"></a>I apologise for the rather lengthy explanation of the amendment, but the issues are extremely important. I also apologise to the Committee for the fact that I have strayed slightly beyond the rather narrow confines of the amendment. However, I gave the Minister's team notice of that. I realise that he will not necessarily be able to answer every question that I have asked this afternoon, but I hope that he will give me some reassurance on the principles and, if necessary, write to me on other points.  I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   In supporting these amendments, I must declare that as chairman of an independent radio company I have some responsibility for news gathering and broadcasting. The fundamental and basic principle is that there should be a fair and open trial subject to public scrutiny by the press and the public. From that base, one begins to consider restrictions on that principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para0"></a>My experience of being engaged in a lengthy trial in which screens were used to screen witnesses and part of the proceedings were heard in camera convinced me that only in the most exceptional cases should there be restrictions placed upon the press. In the particular case that I have in mind, the result was followed by damaging rumour and speculation in the press through to the culmination of the appeal processes. On reflection, it was not in the public interest that there should be restrictions of that kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para1"></a>The Bill deals with the protection of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. Except in the most exceptional circumstances, those witnesses can be safely protected without preventing public scrutiny by the press and the media of what is said while they are giving evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para2"></a>The proposal in Amendment No. 80A that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Representatives of the news media may not be excluded ... unless the court specifically so decides", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
has the positive benefit that the court must give consideration to the issue before excluding the press from the court. I support these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am always grateful to have advice from the Guild of Editors. As I said earlier, one of my amendments resulted from its representations. We have a good record of paying careful attention to editors' interests and those of the broadcast media, as we can demonstrate by virtue of what was formerly <P>


<a name="column_1350"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1350</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 31 of the Data Protection Bill and the amendment to the Human Rights Act, so welcomed by our colleagues in the press.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para3"></a>I entirely agree that it is not right to exclude the press from proceedings simply because they may be embarrassing to public figures. The noble Lord may be interested to know that I am meeting representatives of the print media in the next few days and, as always, I am happy to see representatives of the broadcast media. If there is any sensible way forward by way of amendment either to Clause 24 or to the other clauses with which the noble Viscount dealt--I do not chide him at all because he was developing a theme that concerns later provisions--I am more than ready, as always, to see whether we can safeguard all legitimate interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para4"></a>On the specific amendments, which have a much tighter function, the purpose of the screen or the use of the live link is to reduce stress. They save the witness from having to see the defendant. The screens can also be used to avoid sight lines from the public gallery. That is very important. Very often, the brute intimidation of witnesses, simply by people sitting in the public gallery, is extremely effective, even if they do nothing but sit there mob-handed. The use of neither the live link nor the screen is intended to prevent anyone in the court hearing the evidence; nor from seeing the witness if the court thinks that it is practical and desirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para5"></a>Clauses 22 and 23 provide a list of those participants who must be able to see as well as hear the witness, even if no one else can. That does not include the defendant--although the court may include the defendant--but it includes the judge, the magistrates, the jury (if there is one), and at least one legal representative for each party. We think it essential that they should be able to see the witness, to test the evidence and decide what weight to give it. We also think that an interpreter or intermediary, or anyone else recognised by the court as being there to assist or support the witness, should be able to be in eye contact with him or her.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para6"></a>These amendments seek to ensure that there should be a presumption that representatives of the media should be able to see the witness when a screen is used, and that they should have a right to be able to watch a witness giving evidence via a live link. It may well be desirable for the press to see as well as hear the witness giving evidence. Sometimes it will be possible, depending on the court layout and the nature of the equipment being used. They will always be able to hear what is being said.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para7"></a>However, I am not convinced at present that it is in the interests of justice that these clauses should specifically provide for the press. Court lay-out is very important. Obviously we have inherited an estate, which means that many courts are suitable while others are not as regards the flexibility that one needs. It may not be possible to arrange for the representatives of the media or the public to see the witness or the live link unless the facilities in the court permit this. It is not an easy question. I put this to the noble Viscount rhetorically--and I do not even invite him to write to me: would he <P>


<a name="column_1351"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1351</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be satisfied if representatives of the media were simply two in number, or do we have to have all the competing representatives of the media present?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para8"></a>I should point out to the Committee that news agencies are covered as representatives of the media. Magazine journalists and those writing books could be excluded because of the exclusion provision for members of the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para9"></a>Clause 24 may require the press to be excluded from the court while the witness's evidence is being given. However, that power can only be used where it is determined by the court both that a witness is eligible for "special measures" and that this particular measure is needed to improve the quality of evidence provided to the court, leading to the consequence that the court decides that a particular group or groups of people should be excluded from the court while the witness gives all or part of the evidence. That would be an exclusion for that part of the trial only.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para10"></a>Clause 24 is drafted with a reference to people rather than various galleries or parts of the court, like the public gallery or the press box. So the court does have flexibility to decide which groups of people should be excluded. It might be someone who was not a member of the family of the witness or of the defendant. In the case of a racial attack, it may be members of the public who have proclaimed themselves to be part of a racially motivated group; indeed, it could mean anyone other than members of the press. Alternatively, members of the press could be allowed to stay in the public gallery while others would be required to leave.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para11"></a>In certain circumstances--for example, in a distressing sexual case--the court may wish to exclude everyone, including the press, for that part of the evidence. The court may do so not to stop reporting but simply to allow the witness to give evidence in private without the presence of spectators. The court is already required to specify which people it wishes to exclude when making a direction under Clause 24. It will already have to consider whether this should or should not include the press.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para12"></a>If one looks at Clause 19(4), it will be seen that this encourages a considered decision because it provides that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"special measures directions must specify particulars of the provision made by direction in respect of each special measure which is to apply to the witness's evidence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
So there are significant safeguards against hasty or apparently ill-considered decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para13"></a>I am not persuaded of the need for these amendments, although I recognise that what the noble Viscount and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, have been speaking about goes beyond the narrow confines of the amendments. They are contending on principle that justice ought to be published and ought to be capable of being reported. I certainly believe that to be a fundamental principle, though in some circumstances, which should be as limited as possible, there may have to be restrictions. Of course, there is at present a derogation from that principle.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para14"></a>I believe that a useful way forward is to indicate to the Committee that discussions have already taken place between representatives of the press and broadcast media and officials in the Home Office. From my memory, that was Wednesday of last week. Moreover, I have already arranged a further appointment with officials and representatives of the print media and myself within the next few days. I reiterate that I am perfectly happy, as always, to see representatives of the broadcast media again.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para15"></a>It is most important that we do not fetter the free press; but it is equally important that we pay careful attention to the needs of those who are vulnerable. My mind is open. I cannot guarantee that we will achieve a compromise that is satisfactory to those whom I regard as friends and colleagues in the press or, indeed, to the principles put forward by noble Lords. However, this is a useful marker. I recognise what the noble Viscount said; namely, that he was using these proceedings as an occasion--quite rightly--to develop a wider theme. I shall also pay careful attention to what he said on the wider themes. I hope that we can work together and bring something forward. I repeat: I actually believe in a free press.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-20_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. I apologise to the Committee for straying slightly beyond the narrow confines of my amendment. Nevertheless, I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with that aspect. There are different issues about reporting restrictions with which we will deal when we come to Clauses 43 and 44. Indeed, having read carefully what the Minster said today, we on this side of the Committee will have to consider what amendments we wish to table in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para16"></a>Perhaps I may make a few points as regards the amendments now before us. I accept that there is a difference between what one might call the press and the public--indeed, perhaps what one might describe as the press and a hostile public. There is a difference between the two. As the Minister said, it may be desirable for the public gallery of a court to be closed because it is regarded as hostile to the witness due to the composition of those who are there. I do not necessarily believe that that means that members of the press should be excluded. One does not necessarily follow the other because there are different circumstances involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-20_para17"></a>The Minister asked me rhetorically how many members of the press should be present and whether two would be enough. It is possible that two would be enough. As I am sure the Minister knows better than I, if, for example, members of the Press Association or a similar organisation are present, the transcript or the result of the proceedings are then available to the public at large and, indeed, to the rest of the press.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I entirely take the noble Viscount's point. However, one could imagine a racially motivated case where the only representatives of the press were perhaps people from the National Front. It would not be a case of them being employed by the mainstream press, but they may be present on behalf of <P>


<a name="column_1353"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1353</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one of their wretched, pathetic little magazines. One has to work these things through quite carefully, probably in conversations of the sort that I mentioned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-21_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I take the Minister's point. That is an issue which I believe ought to be considered by the Government and discussed by the Minister when he meets representatives of the press. As I said, I am grateful for the Minister's response However, I am not sure that he has gone far enough at present to satisfy my concerns.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para0"></a>Amendment No. 80A would put the onus on the court. It says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Representatives of the news media may not be excluded under subsection (1) unless the court specifically so decides". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is an important onus and it is one to which we shall return. I hope that the Minister will consider that proposition. I believe that it is important for the courts to have to go through a process whereby they do decide such matters--and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for his support in that respect--rather than it being an automatic process that the press are normally excluded. We want the onus on the courts to make that decision on an individual basis. There is a danger that a kind of precedent will be set whereby it is normal for the press to be excluded.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para1"></a>The Minister generously said that he would talk to representatives of the press. I shall study carefully what he said this evening, and I hope that he will study my rather long introduction to the amendments. In the light of the Minister's response, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-21_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 79B:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 18, line 23, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) Where a direction provides for the witness to give evidence by means of a live link, the court may give permission for a support person, who is not a party to the case, to be present with the witness.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para5"></a>The noble Viscount said: I can be as brief with regard to this amendment as I was verbose on the previous amendment. This is a simple amendment. It provides for someone to be present to support a witness when the latter is giving evidence by live link. There may be people who need such help, whether they are children or elderly people. It is not the easiest process to give evidence by means of a live link, as anyone who has used teleconferencing will be aware. When I was a member of the government, I found that process incredibly difficult. I am not sure that it made life easier. It is a difficult process for people who are not used to it. I hope that the Minister will consider this amendment or a similar measure to enable a witness to have a support person present to enable him or her to feel less intimidated by the whole process. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Speaking Up For Justice recommended this measure. As the noble Viscount indicated, it is important that a supporter should be a <P>


<a name="column_1354"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1354</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>neutral person capable of giving moral support to a witness but not interfering with the evidence. The amendment is not necessary as supporters are already allowed to accompany witnesses in court, and in many courts may accompany them in a live link room. However, that practice is not universal. The Interdepartmental Steering Group on Child Evidence is considering the practice to try to achieve greater consistency across the country. That work will obviously be a useful basis for arrangements for supporters for adult witnesses. I hope that on that basis the noble Viscount will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 19, line 4, at end insert ("under section 16(1) or (2) or 17").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 80 I wish to acknowledge the invaluable support yet again of the noble Lords, Lord Swinfen and Lord Dholakia. I have been most grateful for that support throughout the afternoon. I seek to make it clear through this amendment that the Bill gives people the opportunity to give evidence in private and that this measure will be available to people with learning disabilities and mental health problems as well as to those who are eligible for special measures on the ground of the fear of intimidation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para11"></a>For many people with learning disabilities living in the community even minor instances of intimidation may have a major impact. Minor intimidation may reinforce the perpetrators' impressions of their power and a victim's comparative weakness and may even lead to more serious offences. The court should therefore take seriously the cumulative effect of verbal abuse and intimidation against witnesses who are considered vulnerable as a result of their disability. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I wish briefly to support the amendment purely on the grounds that a number of people with a learning disability, and indeed those who have a mental illness, can easily be frightened by circumstances that will not worry the ordinary able-bodied person in the least. I am sure that the Minister when responding will say that people with disabilities have exactly the same rights under the Bill as anyone else. However, I hope that the courts will take into consideration the fact that sometimes these people are much more vulnerable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I accept entirely what the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, has said. In the context of Clause 24 a witness may be eligible for special measures because he is young, or disabled, or is distressed or frightened about testifying. He may be eligible because he fits all three categories. He may need one measure for one purpose and a second for another.
<P>


<a name="column_1355"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1355</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para12"></a>We would expect any application for special measures to specify in detail why a witness needs them and which special measures are needed. The court may accept the recommendations made. It may on the other hand wish to consider whether another measure, or combination of measures, may be more appropriate. It may indeed wish to offer a measure for which the applicant has not asked. We think it is important that an effort is made to provide no more and no less than the witness requires to give his best evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para13"></a>Clause 24 provides for evidence to be given in private. It allows the court to ask anyone at the trial, apart from those such as the defendant who has to remain, to leave so that the witness can give best evidence in surroundings which are as quiet or as private or as considerate to the witness as possible. Some witnesses who are eligible for help under Clause 16 on the grounds of age, physical or mental impairment, or learning disability, may feel particularly inhibited by the difficulties of speaking in public. The noble Lord made that point. There is a range of measures available in the Bill to help them give best evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para14"></a>The measures in Clause 24 will be open to such a witness or any witness who is eligible for special measures under Clause 17 if he is a witness in a sexual offence case or if the court thinks there are grounds for believing that someone other than the accused has intimidated, or is seeking to intimidate, the witness in relation to testifying. I refer to Clause 24(3) in this regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para15"></a>The provisions of Clause 18(1)(a) and (b) make it perfectly clear that the measures in Clause 24 are available to witnesses who are eligible for special measures under Clause 16 or Clause 17, or both. However, clearing a court should not be undertaken lightly. Wherever possible evidence should be given in public. The principle of open justice is an important one. Experience in overseas jurisdictions at this time is a useful reminder to us of that principle. We therefore believe that the measure should be used only in the limited, constrained circumstances set out in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-21_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   My amendment was intended as a belt-and-braces measure to ensure that Clause 16 is, as it were, referred to from Clause 24.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-21_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford </B>   moved Amendment No. 81:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 19, line 8, leave out first ("the witness") and insert ("a witness who is eligible by virtue of section 16(1)").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para21"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the video recording of an interview of a witness should be available only when the witness fulfils the requirements of Clause 16(1); namely, that he <P>


<a name="column_1356"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1356</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>or she is under the age of 17 at the time of the hearing, or he or she is affected by mental disorder or significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning. As drafted, the provision in Clause 26 would permit that a video recording of an interview of any witness for whom special measures had been granted could be admitted as evidence in chief.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para22"></a>I agree with what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, when replying to an earlier amendment; namely, that children have different needs and different capabilities. There is some sense in having their initial interview shortly after they have lodged a complaint recorded and presented in court as the evidence in chief. Their memory is fresh. It further has the benefit that, in giving their full account of what has occurred and before cross-examination, they can do so in the court proceedings without having to be examined in chief. Under the present provisions, children are subjected to cross-examination by means of a live video link. We shall discuss later whether it is advantageous and fair that they should be cross-examined at an earlier stage and that their cross-examination should be filmed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para23"></a>The provisions in Clause 26(1) relating to all witnesses tip the balance too far against the defendant. It is just the same as the witness coming into court, being provided with a statement of complaint that he or she made at the time and simply reading it out. That is something that we have always prevented in our courts. A contemporaneous statement may be used to refresh the memory, but not as the evidence in chief. If one permits this provision into the proceedings, one is in effect permitting any witness, so long as he or she comes within the provisions of Clause 17, to have that benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-21_para24"></a>Subsection (5)(a) opens the position even further. Although the witness must be called by the party tendering the interview in evidence, the special measures direction may provide that the witness's evidence on cross-examination be given otherwise than by a testimony in court. Again, that is an unacceptable widening of the situation. In trying to preserve the balance between the complainant and the defendant and ensuring that the trial is fair, open and just, these provisions take the matter too far.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The point of this amendment is to restrict the admissibility of video recorded evidence in chief, and therefore video recorded cross-examination, to videos of child witnesses and witnesses with mental disorder or physical and learning disabilities. We believe that that restriction is too harsh if we are genuinely engaged upon a search for the best evidence to be placed before a court.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para0"></a>The Bill offers a wider discretion to admit video evidence, and a stronger presumption that it should be admitted for children than is provided at present. The Bill as presently drafted will allow us to have evidence in chief and video recorded cross-examination arranged according to a timetable for a vulnerable witness who is outside the category that I specified and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, indicated.

<A NAME = "90201-22_para1"></a>The Bill as presently drafted will make it possible to admit video recorded evidence, both evidence in chief and on cross-examination, of witnesses for whom "audience" intimidation at trial is considered by the court to be a critical deterrent from giving the best evidence. It is this last provision that the amendment seeks to remove.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para2"></a>There is a case, if it is carefully and cautiously approached, for keeping nervous witnesses out of court and allowing them to give their evidence in a more relaxed way. We need to bear in mind that for witnesses intimidated by threats or fear of violence the law already allows the written statements of absent witnesses to be placed before the court, or for a witness to be granted absolute anonymity in court.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para3"></a>We do not want to go that far in this provision. We are simply offering the courts a discretion to make a direction that video recorded evidence of a witness should be admitted, and therefore be admissible, where the court is persuaded that the measure is needed to put important evidence before the court. We do not expect directions to be made simply to save the witness embarrassment or shame unless it is truly debilitating. To qualify for this provision, the witness must be so distressed or frightened that his or her ability to give evidence will be affected. I repeat: such witnesses can give evidence at present by way of written statement. I should have thought that that is a good deal less satisfactory than video evidence in chief and cross-examination. I should expect it to be difficult to convince a court to admit video recorded evidence in cases involving frightened witnesses rather than directing that another measure should be used. It should be difficult. It is not an open invitation for all witnesses to give their evidence on video.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para4"></a>The party calling the witness will have to consider whether the witness's evidence would make more impact when given live at trial, whether by live television link or in the courtroom itself. But where the court is capable of being convinced that the measure would offer proper benefits for the witness, and therefore the best evidence, the court--this is all that we say--should have the discretion to award it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   If video recordings are to be admitted as evidence in chief, sometimes they will have been taken by police officers and others in the earlier stages of the investigation. I wonder, therefore, whether those police officers and others will need special training to make sure that interviews are conducted in accordance with the normal rules of court and not simply as an investigation might otherwise proceed. A police officer interviewing a witness in the course of an investigation will not normally follow all the intricacies that are required in court. If he has this provision in mind, he will need to do that. That will involve considerable training, and so on. I note from the Financial Memorandum to the Bill that it is expected to cost the Crown Prosecution Service some &#163;0.7 million a year to admit video recorded evidence in chief. It may be that part of that amount is intended for training, at <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>least so far as the CPS is concerned. However, the training will be more important for police officers and others in the circumstances I have described.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I am heartened by some of the Minister's remarks. He said that it would be in exceptional circumstances that the interview of a witness would be admitted as evidence in chief. Nevertheless, I am not entirely satisfied with his reply. It seems to me that there is a great distinction between a child--a child can be identified as one who requires evidence to be given in this way in court and therefore an interview can be conducted right at the very beginning with all the proper safeguards in place--and any other adult competent witness. It may not be until much later that the question of the competence of that witness, or the quality of the evidence being affected by fear and distress, becomes an issue at all. If at that point, some months later, one then returns to an interview that the police conducted by way of a video recording, I should have thought that in the case of adults the safeguards referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Cope, will not be in place. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment, but I shall return to the matter again.

<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para8"></a>I should declare an interest, which is non-financial, as chairman of Scottish Aquaculture, which is a new organisation created to represent and promote Scotland's various aquacultural interests and species.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para9"></a>This very short Bill amends Section 7(4) of the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 in respect of several fisheries. The amendment would give Ministers, when granting a right of several fishery, powers to specify what implements may be used by fishermen in the area covered by a several order. The Bill, therefore, intends enabling Ministers to authorise, on a case by case basis, the use of non-damaging types of fishing gear, such as creels, in several fishery order areas by fishermen as well as by the grantee of the order. Currently, the 1967 Act is inflexible in this respect. This inflexibility prevents the recognition of a legitimate and compatible capture fishing interest. As a result, the fishing sector has felt compelled to be equally inflexible in its opposition to the granting of several orders.

<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para10"></a>The Bill promises a win-win solution and therefore comes before the House with the full support of all interested parties. Indeed, this proposed solution has enjoyed support that is widespread and from both sectors of the fish industry since a public meeting in Inverness in May 1993. None will know this as well as my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, who chaired the Inverness meeting as the then chairman of the Sea Fish Industry Authority. That meeting unanimously identified the introduction of flexibility as the key to removing the current adversarial stand-off, thereby promoting the use of several orders for shellfish interests, while at the same time protecting the legitimate interests of creel fishermen.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para11"></a>Research by the Sea Fish Industry Authority has indicated that the use of seabed cultivation, protected by several orders, has the potential to increase significantly the production levels for species such as scallops. In addition, and of significance, there is a general recognition that the existence of a high density population of shellfish on a several order site is likely to enhance recruitment to the natural fisheries.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para12"></a>There is, therefore, a strong underpinning element of sustainability in this Bill's proposal. On the one hand, it will enhance both the fishing and shell-fishing opportunities available to some of our most remote and fragile rural communities, while, on the other hand, it will simultaneously promote conditions that enhance natural recruitment. The latter is good for conservation purposes.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para13"></a>The Bill, I reiterate, is the result of long and careful consideration by all interested parties. The wide consultation has attracted support and approval from all those parties. I should add that, if the Bill completes it passage through this House, its sponsor in another place will be the honourable Member for Orkney and Shetland, Mr. Jim Wallace.

I have arrived just in time to congratulate my noble friend Lord Lindsay yet again on introducing the Bill to amend the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967. I have been fortunate enough to listen to him now and to hear again so many of the points that the Sea Fish Industry Authority proved were important the last time that we talked about this matter. The authority carried out a great deal of work on scallops to which my noble friend Lord Lindsay referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para15"></a>It is important to be vigilant and to keep up to date in all our fishing regulations as technology advances and as monitoring of our maritime environment shows an ever-changing picture as we approach 2002 and prorogation. On this occasion I can see nothing to stop the Bill receiving a fair wind in its passage through both Houses. Our British fishermen need all the help and support that they can get. As we have heard, the Bill will allay the fears of many in Scotland. I am happy to support it and I wish my noble friend every success.

<A NAME="90201-22_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   My Lords, I too wish to congratulate the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, on once again bringing this short Bill before your Lordships' House and for explaining it to us in his crisp and complete way. I confirm that we are delighted to give this legislation a fair wind, not simply because it is my honourable friend who will be sponsoring it in another place but also because, for all its shortness, it is an extremely important piece of legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para16"></a>I am delighted to see that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, will be dealing with the Bill from the Opposition Front Bench since he is the broker of Inverness through whom this important piece of legislation comes before us. He is to be congratulated on having brokered the agreement eight years ago, even if it has taken that length of time to arrive in Westminster.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para17"></a>I am tempted to ask your Lordships simply to refer to columns 88 and 89 of Hansard of 1st June because I do not think I can add anything to the copious amounts said on the Bill at that time. However, I was slightly chided by the noble Earl for having ended my remarks on that occasion with a rather feeble attempt at wit, since when a noble friend has pointed out to me what the proper quotation should be. It comes from Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, it would be nice to say that I am delighted to rise to support my noble friend, but I wish that it was not necessary and that the Bill had proceeded through the House last year. On that occasion I was unable to come to the Second Reading debate introduced by my noble friend Lord Lindsay. Perhaps I may, first, thank him for the kind things he said about me. The meeting in Inverness seems so long ago that I had almost forgotten about it. I have not been able to calculate how many scallops might have been brought to the market if we could have had action rather more quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para18"></a>As my noble friend Lord Lindsay said, it is important that we pass the Bill, and I hope that the other place will do so as quickly as possible. The scallop population of the west coast of Scotland, in particular, has declined markedly over the years with two consequences. The first consequence is for the fishermen and the second is for those of us who enjoy scallops: they have become so expensive that it is difficult to enjoy them without thinking about the price.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para19"></a>When the Sea Fish Industry Authority, of which I was the chairman for three years, investigated the cultivation of scallops it was found that one of the ways in which it is done is by the use of lantern systems suspended in the water. But the trouble with that system is that the scallops attract all kinds of other creatures to live on their shells, with the net result that it is an inefficient method of cultivation. The same is true of other shellfish <P>


<a name="column_1361"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1361</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and cultivation methods, but to a much lesser extent, which is why we enjoy mussels and oysters at a very economic price in restaurants these days.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para20"></a>Scallops are proving quite difficult to cultivate with the so-called lantern system. The clever people who work for the Sea Fish Industry Authority, based largely at Ardtoe in the West Highlands, thought up the idea of taking tiny scallops, about the size of a small fingernail, and seeding them in a suitable place in a sea loch, where they would then grow in natural conditions, with clean shells, and so on, and could be harvested at some stage in the future. The side benefit to everyone from that would be that, if they were allowed to go through at least one reproduction cycle, they would help to repopulate the whole of the loch system.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para21"></a>I remember chairing a public meeting in, I believe, Kinlochewe with regard to carrying out such a project on Loch Ewe. We made little or no progress between the various "warring parties", although the warring party on one side was represented by only one person. Obviously, if one puts these shellfish down, one has to make sure that people do not go through the area trawling and thus digging up the small shellfish that have been put down. That is the whole point of the order. While the fishermen and their organisations were very keen to accept the principle, one of the problems was that creel fishermen, who would not damage the bottom of the loch, would also have to be excluded because we had to exclude everyone. That is the importance of this Bill. I hope that we can move ahead quickly with some of the projects in this regard in any area where this takes place. The only kind of fishing that needs to be prevented is that which damages the growing scallops and the sea bottom. Creel fishing or fishing for lobsters, crabs and prawns does not cause that damage and should be allowed to continue. I say that to show that I can still remember some of the things I learned about eight years ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para22"></a>I hope that this Bill will hasten its way to the statute book. More importantly, I hope that the industry will be able to take advantage of it and carry out some of the important work that could be done on the west coast of Scotland. It would bring employment to some of those areas for fishermen and fish farmers--and perhaps even manage to bring us slightly cheaper scallops at the restaurants.

<A NAME="90201-22_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, for introducing this Bill again. It was extremely disappointing that it was objected to last June in another place--although, as noble Lords opposite know, it was through no fault of the Government. The Government's view of this amendment Bill has not changed: we welcome and support it. We recognise the important role several orders can play in the development of farmed shellfisheries and the protection afforded for stock within the designated areas. Only eight several orders have been granted in Scotland, and this has much to do with the concern expressed by the inshore fishermen, which this Bill seeks to address.
<P>


<a name="column_1362"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1362</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para23"></a>The Government want to see greater use of several orders: they make sound economic sense; they offer employment opportunities for those living and working in rural and remote areas; and they can provide the basis for a sustainable shellfishery and a means whereby production can be increased to meet consumer demand for top quality shellfish.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para24"></a>At the present time, the granting of a several order under the 1967 Act provides protection for the shellfish stocks and the owner's rights within the designated area. All other fishing activities are prohibited, except where pelagic trawl nets or hook and line are used.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para25"></a>Herein lies the problem. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay, as long ago as 1993, tried to resolve the sensitivities which had arisen between fishermen and shellfish growers over the use of several orders. Since then, improved guidelines have been introduced. Applicants must submit sound business plans for the operation of the several order site, which the Scottish Office monitors. If enacted, tonight's Bill will address the most important of these issues--namely, that of access of creel fishermen in a several order area. The 1967 Act places an unreasonable restriction on fishing within several order sites, and this fact is accepted by shellfish farming interests and other fishermen. All are agreed that greater flexibility is needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para26"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, who spoke earlier in the debate, helped to improve the scope and effectiveness of this legislation in 1997. It is good that she is still fighting the good fight for this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para27"></a>The noble Earl's amendment will provide that much needed flexibility by removing the current prohibition and giving Ministers discretion, on a case-by-case basis, over the types of fishing which may be permitted within a several order area.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para28"></a>As I have said before, I am grateful to the noble Earl for bringing forward the Bill. I am confident that the amendment, if enacted, will help to resolve some of the difficulties surrounding the granting of several orders in Scotland and should, as a result of greater up-take, stimulate shellfish farming production. Your Lordships gave their support before to this Bill. It has been gratifying tonight to hear the support expressed by the noble Viscount, Lord Thurso, and other noble Lords who have spoken. I commend the Bill to the House.

I am especially grateful that the noble Viscount, Lord Thurso, resorted to Shakespeare this time rather than his home-made wit, which was a feature of the earlier occasion when we discussed this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para29"></a>I am very appreciative that the Government continue to support this Bill so strongly and unambiguously. The Minister gave as good a summary as I could have hoped for of the very cogent reasons why this Bill should be passed into law as soon as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para30"></a>I express special thanks to my two noble friends who have spoken. They have both had considerable experience of the industry, as was obvious from their contributions. My noble friend Lady Wilcox very kindly <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para31"></a>My noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish left us in no doubt as to just how well he knows not only the specific problem that the Bill seeks to address, but many of the other features of this very important industry, which is of extraordinary value to many remote and rural West Highland communities. He was right to stress some of the extraordinary local difficulties that shellfish interests have provoked, and he reminded us of his experiences in Kinlochewe. He is also right that a Bill such as this will promote not only employment but a greater natural recruitment, which will be of immense value in a much wider sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para32"></a>I share his hopes that scallops may become a more accessible commodity in restaurants and elsewhere as a result of this impediment being removed from the interests of the shellfish industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-22_para33"></a>I repeat that the badly needed solution is encapsulated in this amendment. It is wholly modern in the way it would work in promoting both employment and the long-term conservation interests of the natural fisheries. The amendment has enjoyed considerable support outside of the House; I welcome the fact that there is cross-party support for it inside. It is a true reflection of the consensus which lies beyond this House. On that basis, I beg to move.

<A NAME="90201-23_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross </B>   moved Amendment No. 82:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 19, line 15, leave out subsection (3) and insert--
<BR>
("(3) In considering for the purposes of subsection (2) of this section or subsection (1) or (2) of section 27 whether any part of a recording should not be admitted under these sections, the court may refuse to allow evidence on which any party proposes to rely if it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para3"></a>The noble Viscount said: I apologise to the Committee for introducing this topic immediately after an admirable repast. This matter is difficult and complicated but I hasten to assure the Minister that I seek clarification and do not intend to press this collection of verbiage to a Division. Perhaps I may explain the problem that I identify with these provisions. Clause 26 deals with evidence in chief to be used in a wider variety of cases than originally provided for which <P>


<a name="column_1364"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1364</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was only in relation to children. When a video recording of evidence in chief is prepared it is done by means of an interview by people who have very special training. There is a great deal of guidance and manuals and so on are produced to enable this to be done according to a code.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para4"></a>Nevertheless, on occasions it goes wrong. A judge in the Crown Court where these matters mainly occur has a discretion whereby evidence that would otherwise be admissible is excluded on the grounds that it is unfair to allow it to be put before the jury. There are a number of different principles whereby evidence may be so excluded. That the principles should be clear is of enormous importance. It has been said this afternoon that it is not very easy to get convictions in some cases where there is abuse of vulnerable people. It is not for me to say whether or not people should be convicted, but the judiciary certainly should not be hampered by any lack of clarity as to what is its job. If there is an application by either party for evidence to be excluded on the ground that it is unfair the judge must apply the correct principles. If he or she does not do so and there is a conviction it will be overturned by the Court of Appeal because the principles on which the decision has been reached by the judge are wrong. The fundamental issue therefore is to get the principles right.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para5"></a>In common law a criminal judge always had the ability to exclude evidence which would otherwise be admissible on the grounds that it was unfair. In the Police and Criminal Evidence Act two provisions were added to the existing law: one was Section 78 in the terms that I have set out, broadly speaking, in my amendment; the other was Section 82(3) which preserved in so far as it was still required--sometimes it was--the old common law position. That was in 1984. On the basis of Section 78 a very great deal of judicial guidance has been built up in cases before the Court of Appeal. One can refer to quite a large book if this matter arises. All of these cases are individual and one cannot discern a direct precedent but one has the principles and seeks to get the matter right.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para6"></a>When the idea of the video recording of testimony by child witnesses was introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 a new set of provisions was grafted on to the Criminal Justice Act 1988. It took the form of a number of amendments to Section 32 of that Act: the addition of Section 32A and a number of other matters. Section 32A is to be repealed by Schedule 4, as one sees from the top of page 60, as is a good deal of Section 32.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para7"></a>When I raised this matter on Second Reading, however, the noble Lord, Lord Williams, said that I should take comfort from the fact that in Clause 26 of the Bill the test as to a judge's exercise of discretion on admissibility was the same as that found in Section 32A(4), as it is now, of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Broadly speaking, that is true. In Clause 26 one finds a very similar provision in subsections (2) and (3).
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para8"></a>There are, however, very substantial differences. In Section 32A(3) of the 1988 Act, as inserted in 1991, the power to exclude evidence was made subject to the exercise of any power of the court to exclude evidence <P>


<a name="column_1365"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which would otherwise be admissible. In other words, as I read it, it was subject to the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act referred to earlier. There is no repetition of that saving in Clause 26 of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para9"></a>Unfortunately, it does not stop there. Clause 26 of the Bill, together with the repeal provisions, effectively takes the place of Section 32A of the 1988 Act as inserted in 1991. If it is amended so as to accord with the provisions of the 1991 Act that may be adequate for the provision of evidence in chief. Unfortunately, nothing has been provided by way of principles for the exercise of a judge's discretion in relation to evidence that may be video-recorded under Clause 27. There is no cross-reference between Clause 26(2) and (3) and the provisions for cross-examination and re-examination to be video-recorded and presented to the court under Clause 27.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para10"></a>As the position now stands--I am aware that there are Members of the Committee who are extremely familiar with the situation and will put me right if I am wrong--even with child witnesses there may be a contest as to the admissibility of some parts of the video-recorded evidence in chief. For instance, during one of the breaks which are allowed to take place in the course of the video recording the child may go out, and the other party (usually the defence) says that during that period the child was coached. The child comes back, continues the video recordings and produces all the necessary information and evidence about the offence with which the court is concerned. There is objection about what happened during the gap and one has to hear evidence about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para11"></a>That situation will continue to occur. The Bill has simplified the tests for the Crown Court judge. It has made them different from those under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. I do not know what they are supposed to be. However, there is now the proposition that cross-examination and re-examination should be on video as well, and a further problem arises. There is no reference in the Bill about the principles for admissibility of evidence and fairness. In the course of cross-examination there is often a pause because the attention span of the witness may be brief. There has to be a short adjournment. There is an allegation that the witness was coached. As a result there may be a challenge as to the admissibility of what happened thereafter.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para12"></a>Furthermore, there is provision in Clause 27(5) and (6) for the recall of a witness in certain circumstances even after cross-examination and re-examination. It can occur only on the basis that some new material has come to the notice of the defence, and it therefore wishes to recall that witness. At that moment--I speculate because no one knows how the provision will work--some part of the pre-recorded video of the cross-examination may come under challenge. Some additional evidence may throw doubt upon the safety of allowing the material to go before the jury. Nothing in the Bill states the principles which the judge has to apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para13"></a>As I read the Bill, the judge has to apply to examination in chief the principles derived from Clause 26 alone without paying attention to Sections 78 or 82(3) of the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Police and Criminal Evidence Act. For the purpose of admissibility of cross-examination or re-examination there is no guide. Presumably one goes back to the terms of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. If that is so, there is a different test. The words are different as regards the principles that the judge has to take into account now and those which will apply to examination in chief, cross-examination and re-examination in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para14"></a>I seriously doubt that I have the position right. I cannot believe that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, would present a Bill to Parliament which does not clarify that situation. The amendment merely reproduces the formula in Section 78 in the hope that we might have a constant provision throughout the jurisdiction. In the hope that we shall have an explanation of how the provision is to work, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I support the amendment put forward by the noble Viscount. I cannot attempt to match his analysis of the interplay between Sections 26 and 27. However, when admissibility of evidence in a criminal trial is being considered by a judge it is clearly desirable that he applies one test. For him to have to turn from one statutory provision to another in order to determine the correct test is unacceptable and confusing. If there is to be a different test, it is a matter that will trouble the Court of Appeal. We are familiar with the test set out in the noble Viscount's amendment from Section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. It is frequently before the court and frequently in the minds of judges. It is obviously the correct test. I invite the comments of the Minister on the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   As currently drafted, Clause 26(3) of the Bill is based on the test for admissibility of video evidence which already is to be found, as the noble Viscount correctly points out, in Section 32A of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. That test required the judge to balance the possibility of the jury being prejudiced against the defendant by a part of the recording with the desirability of showing the whole recording intact so that there is in fact a complete picture of the witness's evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para15"></a>It was developed for the specific circumstance of video recordings. The court might consider, for instance, that the recording shows an exchange between questioner and witness which the rules of evidence would exclude but which could be edited out without damage to the rest of the recording being used in evidence. Alternatively, the court might prefer--indeed, the defence might wish it--to allow the whole recording to be shown and the jury warned that it should have regard to the prejudicial nature of the question and the consequential answer.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para16"></a>Section 78 of PACE is intended for evidence in general. It is not adapted to the specific question of video-recorded evidence. I am not sure that the noble Viscount's amendment explicitly provides for the possibility of part of the recording being excluded while the rest was admitted.
<P>


<a name="column_1367"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para17"></a>I do not think that the test will be confusing for judges. It is substantially the same as is already used under Section 32A of the 1988 Act. The amendment would also extend the reach of the new subsection (3) to the editing of video-recorded cross-examination. We need to remember that the cross-examination will have been controlled by a judge with all the parties to the case present. We believe that anything prejudicial to the defendant should have been stopped at the time of that hearing. However, subsection (4) of Clause 27 allows a video recording of a cross-examination to be excluded after it has been made if the rules of court or the direction allowing the cross-examination have not been complied with. We think that they are sufficient safeguards.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para18"></a>I turn to Section 78 and Section 82(3) of PACE since both sections were mentioned by the noble Viscount. Section 82(3) of PACE preserves the common law power of the court to exclude any evidence at its discretion. Neither that nor Section 78 of PACE overrides Section 26(3), which is simply specific additional provision on the admissibility of video evidence under Section 26. On the basis of the advice I have received, it seems to me that Section 78 continues as a general provision enabling the courts to refuse to allow any evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely, subject to the question--it is what Section 78 is supposed to preserve--of the overall fairness of the proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para19"></a>Section 78 applies to all evidence, as we can see from the case of R v. Mason, Vol. 86 Criminal Appeal Reports. It is not limited, as used to be thought, to the admissibility of confessions. There is no reason to think that Section 78 does not apply to prosecution evidence under Clause 26. I do not believe therefore that the amendment is necessary as regards prosecution evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para20"></a>We are dealing with new bases of admissibility of types of evidence because we are applying it further to what has been known in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para21"></a>I know that the noble Viscount has gone to a good deal of trouble in relating Clauses 26 and 27, to Sections 78 and 82(3) of PACE and the various possible differences of nuance that there might be to the judicial approach. Therefore, whether or not the noble Viscount intends to press the amendment--he indicated that he was probing--I wish to give a certain amount of thought to the inter-relationship between Clauses 26 and 27 of the Bill with Sections 78 and 82(3) of PACE. I agree entirely with the noble Viscount that one wants to put one's mind to these inter-relationships and to consider, and reconsider for my part, whether there may be some fudging of the different criteria that ought to be applied under the respective clauses. I undertake to do that. I shall write to the noble Viscount and to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and those Members of Committee who have shown an interest. I shall also put a copy of my reply in the Library.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-23_para22"></a>Not for the first time, the issues raised by the noble Viscount are certainly well worthy of further consideration and I undertake to give them that.

<a name="column_1368"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1368</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>possible for the Minister to put on one sheet of paper the considerations which the judge will have to take into account in deciding whether to admit video recorded evidence in chief in a case such as this. If that is difficult to do--judging by the discussion we have just had it is quite difficult--it seems to me that it would be very difficult for police officers and other people involved in interviewing child witnesses and others in the course of an investigation to get it right in a manner which will stand up in court. It is not only learned judges and counsel who will have to be able to follow the rules, whatever they are in the end, but other people with much less expertise, who will need to be able to follow and obey the rules in order to be successful in producing evidence in chief which can be used and lead to the correct decision in the court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Perhaps I may respond quite briefly to the noble Lord, Lord Cope. As the noble Viscount pointed out, we have had the video recording of interviews with children for almost 10 years. As he rightly pointed out, there is a memorandum of good practice and the training of police officers in the taking of statements. I understand that the noble Viscount's question is not really directed at the obtaining of material but dealing with it in its judicial context either in the magistrates' court, or as he rightly said, more likely in the Crown Court.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para0"></a>That is the question to which his observations and interventions have been addressed and on which I have focused my mind. It may be that at the end of the day I shall simply come back and say that I believe Clause 26(3) and the present Clause 27 are sufficient. But I believe that he has raised perfectly legitimate queries about the inter-relationship between at least four clauses. I undertake to think more carefully about it, even if I come to the same conclusion, and to write appropriately as I promised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, perhaps I may ask two questions. In the giving of evidence children are mentioned all the time. I presume that the safeguards in taking evidence apply equally as much to people with a learning disability. The second question may be rather naive. If the editing of evidence is allowed, who is going to be present from the court to ensure that it is conducted in a true and proper manner?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Again, I want to be as helpful as I can. The reason I mentioned training over the past 10 years and the memorandum of good practice, is that it has been in the context of children's evidence. But the lessons we have learnt from that good practice will be applied to those who have a disability. As regards editing, that takes place in a court context because the judge makes a ruling that certain questions and answers should not be allowed. That is one stage. The taking of cross-examination is subject to judicial control as well. So if one means editing physically, that can be done by a direction from the judge in the Crown Court context, but if one means editing in the form of, <P>


<a name="column_1369"></a>

<P>
<A NAME="90201-24_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross: </B>   I am grateful to those who have taken part in this debate, particularly if they understood what I was trying to say because it is not very easy. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Williams, very much for his offer to look at this matter again.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para1"></a>I wish to make three brief points. If he is right that Clause 26 is to be governed overall by the tests and principles in Sections 78 and 82(3) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, why does not the clause contain the same saving that is in the section which includes the proviso of being subject to the exercise of any power of the court to exclude evidence which is otherwise admissible? That is the cross-reference in that provision to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. If the Minister is right in that those provisions override, why is it not in the Bill?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, was quite right in saying that the video-recording of cross-examination and re-examination of any witness will be of a wider range than just children. There is no real safeguard in Clause 27(4) because the rules of court for these purposes, if they are like the rules that we have had before, simply deal with the number of days to transpire before the second stage is taken. The directions will have been given before the event and are unlikely to be the cause of the trouble. I believe the noble Lord will understand that the whole process involved in Clause 27 is organic, it is something added to the law and system that we have now. There is the ability to re-open the cross-examination, as I have mentioned previously.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para3"></a>None of this is foreseeable. The way in which challenges as to admissibility are going to occur is unknown at the moment. Without any clear guidelines in the Bill itself, I doubt whether it will be easy for judges to get it right. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the noble Lord will look at this again. I am sure that he will not come to it with any preconceptions that the Bill must be right. I am asking for absolute clarity so that in dealing with these matters the judiciary does not make a mistake on its part. Whatever else may go wrong with the trial, at least the judiciary will have clear guidance about what it is to do and the principles it has to apply. I welcome what the Minister has said. I look forward to his letter and a further discussion with him when I have received it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>either the Explanatory Notes or Speaking Up For Justice  there is a suggestion that cross-examination and re-examination on video of witnesses who are to be given the protection of special measures should not necessarily be controlled by the magistrate or the judge. That is a disastrous suggestion to make. If there is one thing that has been learnt from the experience of video recorded evidence in chief and the cross-examination of a child witness--which is all that we have had so far--on the live link, it is that there has to be very close control indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para8"></a>There is the inevitable tendency for cross-examining counsel to cover a point for longer than is necessary. He may not remember that a child's attention span is not very long. He may not allow time for a pause, certainly not for coaching but so that the child may have a short break in the proceedings for reflection. There are many reasons why it is necessary to have judicial control over the cross-examination and re-examination. Those who have taken part in trials will know that that is right and if properly exercised, it enhances the quality of evidence which witnesses give.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para9"></a>Therefore, I thought it worthwhile to make sure that the policy indicated in whichever of those documents it was, is not to be put into practice when the Bill comes into force. I seek an assurance from the noble Lord that that will not be the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para10"></a>That will be particularly important if there is a risk that cross-examination may continue by way of a recall under Clause 27. It must be right the first time because the defence will not have another opportunity unless it has new material of which it could not reasonably have had knowledge at the time. Therefore, close judicial control over those proceedings is necessary. I look forward to an assurance from the noble Lord that that is exactly what is intended. I beg to move.

<A NAME="90201-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I noticed an interesting difference between this provision--particularly if it were to be amended in the way suggested by the noble Viscount--and the position in Scotland. In Scotland, as I read it, if there is to be separate giving of evidence by vulnerable witnesses, including children, the evidence is taken by a legally qualified commissioner appointed by the court and acting for the court. I wonder whether the Home Office has considered that possibility for England and Wales or whether it did not regard it as working very satisfactorily in Scotland. However, I have no real evidence to suggest that it is anything other than satisfactory in its operation North of the Border.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-24_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount for raising this issue. I assure him that we should absolutely prefer the same judge or justices who has or have heard an application for special measures as part of a pre-trial hearing to control interim proceedings such as the video-recorded cross-examination; and who would then take the case at trial. I am quite certain that the Court Service, the judiciary and the magistracy will make every effort to ensure that that is so.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para11"></a>As the noble Viscount pointed out, that provides consistency for parties and the witness. Explanations to the jury in due course about the video-recorded evidence may well be fuller, more explanatory and, perhaps, better informed if the same person or persons control proceedings throughout. For a vulnerable witness, a familiar face is important.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para12"></a>But we must recognise that it will not always be practicable if we are to avoid unnecessary delay. Unnecessary delay is a significant feature of the damage that is done to children or other vulnerable witnesses. Therefore, I am happy to give that indication as firmly as I may to the noble Viscount.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para13"></a>I do not believe that such an absolute rule as he proposes is necessarily in the interests of justice for the defendant. Delay is often a blemish from the defendant's point of view too. The identity of the judge or justices who control the trial ultimately is perhaps not as important, but we wish to have continuity as far as we can possibly attain it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-24_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, asked me about taking evidence on commission. I had jotted down something about that earlier. There are sometimes difficulties about taking evidence on commission. Sometimes, the commissioner has not the authority to rule out inadmissible material. In the circumstances of our new experience, it is probably better to have the evidence controlled judicially for all the reasons which the noble Viscount gave. I am happy to give that clear indication--I do not believe I could have made it plainer--in response to the noble Viscount's question.

<A NAME="90201-25_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross: </B>   The noble Lord has made it very clear. It is quite right that it would not be possible to statutorily require the same judge or justices necessarily to sit at all stages. Nevertheless, the Minister has given the principle which I am sure will now be followed. He has forsworn what was in that previous document. I am extremely happy with the situation and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-25_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross: </B>   At this stage, I wish to refer to the practicality and usefulness of Clause 27. It may be that other Members of the Committee will be able to make better contributions about this matter. However, we should examine the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para2"></a>I am wholly in favour of the video recording of cross-examination and re-examination, particularly if there are not to be later recalls when the defence has eventually decided exactly what it is that it wishes to present to the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para3"></a>However, I wish to make certain that the introduction of that provision on to the statute book does not raise false hopes. I said at Second Reading--and I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, has confirmed it--that since the Pigot Report suggested the whole of this procedure, there has been the intervention of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 which sets out a statutory progression of primary disclosure, <P>


<a name="column_1372"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1372</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>defence statement and secondary disclosure leading to the preparations for the trial. That is an admirable arrangement but it takes time.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para4"></a>Time is not on the side of obtaining real and reliable evidence from the kind of people for whom special measures are required. The noble Lord, Lord Rix, will know better than I about some of the people with various other disabilities. But I know that the memory of children is very short. Three may be a delay of six to nine months between the time when the alleged offence occurred and the time when the children are asked questions about it, having first, in rather unfamiliar circumstances, seen the video recording of their own evidence-in-chief. They are then asked questions about it. They have great difficulty remembering what happened and being able to explain, in answer to questions, what occurred. They take refuge in saying that the incident happened a long time ago and they have forgotten. Consequently, their evidence is not as reliable or helpful as it should be to the jury or anyone else.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para5"></a>I am concerned about the timetable and the facilities and my Amendment No. 84 is relevant to that. My Amendment No. 135 repeals the special provision about facilities for video recordings for petty sessional divisions. If no facility is available in a magistrates' courts area another facility can be used somewhere else. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, mentioned that earlier, saying that there are sufficient venues for video recordings for all these proceedings. If that is the case, why repeal Section 32 which makes specific provision for that?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para6"></a>Whether or not there are sufficient venues, what is the timetable to be? How is justice to be improved by the provisions in Clause 27? I would guess that the defence would never be ready to cross-examine, certainly not without the risk of a further recall of the witness later on, until all the secondary disclosures have been made, the defence witnesses collected, statements taken by the defence solicitor and all that has been considered by defence counsel. Unless there is a speeding up of the process over and above what happens in the Crown Courts--certainly in my experience, and mine was one of the pilot courts in the video-recording process--children and other witnesses under a disability will be cross-examined on video months and months after the event. I seriously doubt whether that will be an improvement on the current situation in which they are cross-examined in court on the video-link, not subject to further recall as the Bill provides, their evidence standing or falling as they come across on the day.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para7"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, will say that something special is to be done about such a case because the essence is speed. If speed is not introduced into the proceedings, I fear that all the admirable aspirations set out in Clause 27 will come to nothing and that hopes will be falsely raised and dashed when it is seen not to work. I look forward to his explanation of what is to be done to make the proposal effective and quick and being told that we shall take the opportunity of getting the evidence before the jury on videotape when the witness can remember what happened.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Mallalieu: </B>   Although I do not support any attempt to take Clause 27 out of the Bill, I express concerns about its practical effect. The ideal is to have a cross-examination following directly on from the evidence-in-chief and as near as possible to the time of the first complaint. The reality is that it will be a slow process to amass the necessary material for cross-examination, which in many cases may involve additional applications to the court for disclosure. In cases involving children, particularly those who have a relationship with local care authorities, it is not unusual for there to be applications for the disclosure of social services records, which often do not become available until shortly before trial.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para8"></a>I am troubled that attempts may be made to use the provision as a norm, or at any rate regularly, when at later stages it will be impossible for a judge to refuse an  application to recall the child for further cross-examination because material has come to light which could not have been in the hands of the defence earlier. The end result may be that the child undergoes two periods of cross-examination rather than one. I would like the Minister to indicate whether he sees the provisions as being "the norm" or whether they will apply only in relatively exceptional circumstances where all the material is available and no further material is anticipated to be forthcoming.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-25_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   From a lay person's point of view, all these complications that will prolong the process are not particularly easy to understand, but the point is that for a child this is absolutely impossible. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children tells us that now the average length of time for a trial involving cases such as this is 10 months. That is the average, and for many it is longer. They say that it looks as though under this new process things will get worse. I think the noble Viscount has suggested that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para9"></a>Childline have written to me to say that they get much involved with children in this kind of thing and that speed is of the essence in these cases. They are appalled at the thought of a long process. It just will not work, and even if it is the exception, as the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, suggested it might be, what about those children who are the exceptions? I do not think it will do. Even if it means going back to the drawing board on this matter, I think we should do so, because anyone who understands anything about children will realise that they will not be able to give proper evidence. I do hope that the noble Lord, the Minister, is going to look at this very hard indeed.

<A NAME="90201-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   I believe that the noble Viscount is right. Time is of the essence in relation to children's memories and the recall of events.

<FONT SIZE=3>suggest, in making it easier for the video-taping of evidence in chief to be used in cases, particularly of sexual abuse of children, if we do not then follow through in terms of cross-examination and re-examination, using the same video-taping. If we do not follow through, we end up with the situation we have had over the last few years in the courts, with the absence of this facility to use video-taping being a real deterrent to the successful prosecution of people who have abused children.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para10"></a>If we only go through part of the process in which we actually have evidence in chief video-taped but we cannot video-tape the cross-examination and re-examination, all we shall end up with is a situation in which there is a real deterrent to prosecution because children will not come forward. It seems to me that we have to re-examine the way in which the court processes are working and in these particular cases we have to use our best endeavours to speed up the process and recognise the circumstances of the children involved in these cases.

I refer to the difficulty of having the cross-examination outside the trial--in some cases well outside the trial in point of time, it seems--when the defence will not really be in a proper position to cross-examine as it would be by the time of the trial, having much more information, much more disclosure and all the rest of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para11"></a>It seems to me that it is extremely difficult to have a cross-examination taking place a long time before the trial takes place. This point was made to me by the Law Society and others. But that runs across the point which has also been raised in this most interesting little debate about the question of time that elapses between the offence and its coming to court. Like my noble friend, I have seen the suggestion that at the moment in child witness cases there is an average of 10 months--I repeat, an average--so presumably in some cases it must be quite a lot longer.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para12"></a>It has been my observation that one's appreciation of any span of time is actually not absolute as life proceeds, but it is a function of one's age. When you are 10 one year is 10 per cent. but when you are 60, 10 per cent. is six years. In a sense, the youngster who looks forward to Christmas at any point in the year sees it as being much further away than one does at 60, when it seems that Christmases come round very quickly one after the other. That is just an indication of the difficulties of taking evidence from children 10 months, let alone much more, afterwards.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-25_para13"></a>That runs counter to the problems of having the cross-examination outside the trial. I do not see how to resolve those problems. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that to separate the evidence-in-chief from cross-examination is also very difficult and could make one or the other less valid. It could actually make the evidence-in-chief less valid if the cross-examination is a long time after it; one should try and keep them together. The only answer is to speed <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>up the trials. I know that a great deal of effort has gone into trying to speed up trials in recent years and, though there has been some beneficial effect, there is still considerable delay. So the Government are struggling with very great dilemmas on behalf of us all.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   It is impossible for cross-examination to follow immediately after the interview under Section 26. It should be borne in mind that Section 26 deals with the provision,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for a video recording of an interview of the witness to be admitted as evidence in chief". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It would be impossible to cross-examine any such witness without taking instructions. That requires that the video recording be made available to the defence and that time be provided for a proper conference or consultation to take place before the arrangements can be made for the cross-examination and re-examination of the witness to happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para0"></a>The Committee should not be left with the impression that it is possible to have a witness interviewed and on the same day for that witness to be cross-examined by counsel in full possession of his instructions. If that were to happen, if that is the intention of these provisions, it is almost inevitable that at a later stage the witness would be recalled to give evidence and subject himself or herself to further cross-examination.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para1"></a>A further point that has to be made is this: the Committee has addressed these provisions almost as though they were concerned solely with the sexual abuse of children. That is not the case. These are broad and wide provisions. I have not pressed my amendment to Clause 26(1) to confine "the witness" to a witness as described in Section 16(1); namely, a witness under the age of 17 or subject to some disability. Therefore these provisions apply to any witness where the court is satisfied that the quality of that witness's evidence is likely to be diminished by the reason of fear or distress. That can be any adult witness and is not confined to sexual abuse; it can extend to any criminal proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para2"></a>For example, I had the experience of dealing with a murder case in which the deceased was subject to a severe disability, as was the defendant and around half a dozen of the witnesses; they were all subject to disability. These provisions, therefore, could apply in a murder case. And one can easily imagine a fraud case where the critical and crucial witness was in such fear and distress of what might happen to him or her when the matter comes to the attention of those further up the chain of criminality that he or she might come within these provisions. The provisions could therefore apply to a fraud case.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para3"></a>It is virtually impossible to cross-examine a critical witness in a fraud case without primary and secondary disclosure taking place. So let us not confine ourselves to the sexual abuse of children in considering how broad these provisions are. I have attempted to confine them to children and those who are disabled but that has not so far been successful. Therefore one has to look at the implications on a much wider basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I am not experienced in these matters but I wonder whether the Minister can instruct me. Am <P>


<a name="column_1376"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1376</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I right in thinking that much of the evidence that will be given by a child--and perhaps others--will be taken by the police during their investigations, even before a defendant has been found, and that those interviews will be used in court as evidence? In those circumstances, there will have been no chance for the defendant's counsel even to have been appointed, so that evidence could not be questioned in the very early stages. It could be months before a defending counsel is appointed. As the evidence has to be fresh in a child's mind to ensure that it is correct, it is taken in the course of police inquiries before a court case is even contemplated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The noble Lord is quite right: as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, rightly reminded us, Clause 27 refers to video-recordings of interviews of witnesses. If the accused is not apprehended for some time, in the nature of things, there cannot be a virtually contemporaneous cross-examination. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, again rightly pointed out, you cannot cross-examine properly and professionally until you have instructions and, as the noble Viscount again rightly pointed out, you cannot cross-examine efficiently and professionally until you have had disclosure in some cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para4"></a>I see the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, in his place. When I say, "What about this, that or the other?", he frequently chides me with the doctrine of unripe time. I have always been amused by that. Your Lordships are now saying, "In some cases it may be difficult, so let us, therefore, do nothing in any circumstance where it might be of assistance to a child or a witness under disability".
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para5"></a>Unless we start, we shall get nowhere. Of course, there will be some difficulties. Of course, the inertia of the judicial machine will continue. Apparently, to the outside observer, it regards itself as more important than those fundamentally concerned with it; namely, the complainants, the public and the defendants. I am not pretending--I never have--that this Bill provides a perfect remedy in every circumstance, but there are many cases where endless disclosure, primary and secondary, is not required. There are many cases in which disclosure is not fundamentally important. In those cases, which may be a minority--nevertheless, an important minority--after all this time we ought to begin to get on with the protection of victims in our system, whether they are complainant witnesses, child witnesses, witnesses under disability or simply the terrorised witnesses. I remind your Lordships yet again that there is already a provision for the admissibility in  evidence, without cross-examination in some circumstances, of statements made by those who are too terrorised or too afraid to come to court.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para6"></a>The noble Viscount is quite right in his historical reminder. The measures are based on a recommendation made by the late Judge Pigot in his advisory group on video evidence, which was published a long time ago--in 1989. He made the general suggestions which formed the basis of our approach. As the noble Viscount said, with his enormous experience of the court system, it is  perfectly true that the Pigot recommendations <P>


<a name="column_1377"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1377</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>significantly predated the disclosure provisions introduced in April 1997 by the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para7"></a>In many cases--I have never pretended differently--the defence is unlikely to be ready or willing to cross-examine witnesses until shortly before a trial begins. It would be wrong for any procedure or any judge to attempt, coercively, to interfere. I stress the words, "until shortly before a trial begins". If the average is 10 months--that means that some cases take longer than 10 months--that is a standing, continuing reproach to our judicial system. There is no reason why the judicial system should not be taken firmly by the neck and shaken. I do not mean the judges; I mean the whole system which, for far too long, has been polluted by interference on a delaying basis by those who are well versed in it. I speak as a game-keeper who was formerly a poacher, but now retired.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para8"></a>If we try, we can make improvements. They will not be 100 per cent. appropriate for every child complainant, every child witness or every adult who may be under a disability. There are two alternatives: either we begin with this enormous effort of will and determination or we do nothing. I am too young to want to do nothing.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para9"></a>As the noble Viscount said, it is perfectly true that this will be an inappropriate help in many cases, but it will be better than what we offer at present. It will be a start to doing away with uncertainty. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, was quite right; indeed, it entirely coincides with my experience. Nine months or 10 months is a lifetime to a child. What is even worse is the constant nagging, on going to bed every night, of not knowing whether or not they will have to give evidence and when the court date will be. At least certainty is better than that; we owe it to people. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, is quite right to say that we must not confine ourselves to children because many other people have the oppressive fears that we have colluded in for far too long.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para10"></a>There are some cases where we could get the video recording of evidence in chief fairly closely followed by cross-examination. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said, that would be very difficult in fraud cases; indeed, it could also be difficult in some murder cases. But in quite a number of other cases it would be perfectly straightforward.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para11"></a>Given the will and determination that noble Lords have shown they abundantly share in the context of the Crime and Disorder Bill, we must bend our minds and wills to the training of those who participate in the system. It can be made to work. After all, the listing system is quasi-judicial, but it is not beyond our wit, intelligence and, perhaps more importantly, imagination to list cases in an appropriate way to ensure, as criminal justice is now beginning to do, that priority cases get true priority. There is no difficulty in that respect, except the lack of will and determination.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para12"></a>Therefore, we should start to manage cases better. After all, I am addressing the Committee in the context of the Woolf reforms, where the noble and learned Lord's theory and philosophic approach is that judges <P>


<a name="column_1378"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1378</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should manage cases--what an extraordinary proposition! The public interest in the speedy adjudication and determination of all disputes, whether criminal or civil, is properly regarded as part of the public's interest. They are not private proceedings between the prosecution and the defence; they are wholly involved morally, politically and socially with the public interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para13"></a>I recognise that this is not a perfect solution, because there will be none. However, it is an improved solution. I am saying that we must make a start. We must train practitioners and make them see that it is a professional obligation. We must encourage the judicial system about listing and we must also encourage judges consistently to manage the criminal cases that are in their court centres. There is no one--be it the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls in a civil context, the Lord Chancellor, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney-General--who does not believe that these are coincident interests to which we can work towards.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para14"></a>I am not going to promise that the world, presently flat, will become round as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent. I know that not to be true. However, we can and must make a start. If we can give certainty to those witnesses who are vulnerable--a decent regard for their vulnerability is all that we are pressing for--we can make a start. There will be difficulties. There will be those who will not see that any reform can conceivably be of any advantage. There will also be those who will say that when they started at the Bar, when they first became solicitors or when they first learned to read and write, things were different. Of course things were different then; but, fortunately, they will not remain the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-26_para15"></a>As I said, there will be difficulties. However, I believe we can manage them in the way that we are managing the Narey experiments. We can have designated judges, as, indeed, we have designated judges to try rape cases. I see that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, is present this evening. If I may say so without presumption, one of the great ornaments of his tenancy of the Woolsack was that the Children Act was brought into play. For virtually the first time it was a necessary requirement--which he insisted upon--that judges who tried these extremely difficult cases should not be allowed to try them without being designated, and they could not be designated without being trained. We do not necessarily need statute for these things. What we need is the efficient management of a system which creaks.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Many judges here look at this not only with amazement but with shame.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   The noble Lord makes my case for me that this clause is too widely drafted. He says that we should start. I agree with that as I do not wish to stand still. But let us also prioritise. As this Bill is drafted at present, the provisions could be used, for example, for supergrasses who would certainly be in fear and who would certainly have their evidence qualified by that fear. That is not the kind of case we want to start with. Let us go back to the provisions of Clause 16(1) and look at the people who are declared eligible for assistance in that subsection; namely, children and those suffering from a disability. Let us start with them. As experience of the use of video recording expands, we can move to other areas and to other defendants.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I shall reply briefly. In some supergrass cases the allegations are of serial murder and torture. I decline to accept the proposition that they are of less public interest and importance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </B>   Before the noble Lord completes his response can he say whether it is necessary that the special measures direction, which permits the examination-in-chief to be on video, need be the same as permits that for the cross-examination; in other words, may it not be desirable to allow for the possibility that as the procedure develops it may appear practicable--although it did not earlier--to have the cross-examination on video? It appears that the decision with regard to the cross-examination has to be made at the same time as the decision with regard to the examination-in-chief, if I have understood the position correctly. I am, of course, subject to correction. I thank the noble Lord for what he said about me earlier. That was kind of him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I have made those remarks on many public occasions for the modest reason that I believe the reforms of the Children Act were correct. I shall consider the noble and learned Lord's question. My immediate impression is that a direction as to special measures can be capable of being altered as circumstances change. If I am wrong about that, I shall of course write to the noble and learned Lord. Even if I am correct, I shall write to confirm that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </B>   Assuming that that cannot be done in terms of the Bill, it would appear to me--from what I have heard so far--desirable that it should be done. In any event, if that is not the case, it may be wise to change the position.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-27_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross </B>   moved Amendment No. 84:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 27, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Time limits for video recorded evidence cases </B></center><BR>
(" . Where a court makes a special measures direction under section 26 or 27, it may, notwithstanding any time limits provided by regulations under section 12 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, give and enforce such time limits as it thinks fit for the expeditious bringing to trial of the accused.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-27_para1"></a>The noble Viscount said: This amendment gives me an opportunity to comment briefly on the previous debate. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, mentioned the method whereby the special directions will be given. He is right in saying that there should be a provision enabling that to be done in separate stages according to what happens in a particular case.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-27_para2"></a>What happens in existing trial cases is this. When the police decide that there is a case to be investigated, they take a statement from the child. It will in future be from a much wider selection of witnesses. It is not until much later, when the matter comes up for discussion--for instance, under Section 32A of the 1988 Act--that it has to be decided, usually by, the Crown Court, whether that statement will be admissible as part of the evidence in chief of the witness. That is the first time that the matter comes before the court, although the material has already been prepared--it is on tape by that time, and has been for a little while.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-27_para3"></a>The point of this amendment is to take the noble Lord, Lord Williams--and indeed the noble Lord, Lord Lester--up on the whole issue of shaking everyone up and getting these cases hurried up. I could not resist drafting this clause. The Bill already includes (in Clause 22) screens, which we use now; evidence by live link (under Clause 23), which we use now; evidence given in private (under Clause 24) which we do now; and removal of wigs and gowns (under Clause 25) which we do now. I thought, therefore, that it would be following this very suitable trend if I tabled a new clause to allow judges to take charge of a case.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-27_para4"></a>At Second Reading I made some suggestions as to how matters could be speeded up. So far as concerns the judiciary, they can certainly do that once the matter comes to the Crown Court. What they cannot control are the events that precede that stage. I suggested at Second Reading that when the CPS, or whoever it will be under the Access to Justice Bill, finds a case where a witness is likely to give evidence on video and will possibly have to be cross-examined, it should be given priority. The public defender service, or whatever that will be under the Access to Justice Bill, should make certain that the defence is alerted to the priority of the case, and that the magistrates are alerted so that the matter is given priority in the magistrates' court for committal purposes. Then, when the case comes to the Crown Court, of course the noble Lord, Lord Williams, is right: the listing system is a judicial one and something can be done about it. But nothing at all can be done about it until the matter arrives in the hands of the judicial system in the Crown Court. The magistrates have their own judicial system. They can do it if they are given the necessary encouragement. I have therefore tabled a proposal that can be done anyway. That is the trend in <P>


<a name="column_1381"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1381</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this Bill--to make statutory what everyone can do anyway. The only point I have added is that the time limits could be enforced. That we can do anyway, by means of wasted costs orders. If this provision were written into the Bill it might add a little punch to the views that are being expressed on all sides of the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-27_para5"></a>The noble Lord is not expected to accept this amendment. I merely point out to him that it is not just the listing and judicial system that is involved; it is the entire scope of the criminal proceedings. All those involved in them must have a little spur to push them along faster than they go at present. One of the spurs is that the Crown Court should give the necessary directions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-27_para6"></a>When this matter was discussed in 1991, the noble Lord's predecessor as Minister of State, the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, rejected this whole approach. He said that it was not practicable. I am glad that the Government and the Home Office have changed their mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-27_para7"></a>I remember from my period as Minister of State, a very long time ago, that when a file became the subject of the attention of the parliamentary commissioner, the colour of its cover changed. It became dark red--maroon--and everyone knew that it was a very important file. I wonder whether we might use some colour-coding system of that kind which would enable these cases to receive the priority which I am sure they deserve. In the meantime, I wonder whether the noble Lord would like to follow his own lead and incorporate into the Bill things that we can do anyway but which perhaps ought to have some statutory backing. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-27_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am happy to be teased by the noble Viscount that we are simply putting into statute what he and his judicial colleagues do anyway. I do not believe that that is universally true about the Bill. We are talking in the context of the Crime and Disorder Act and its consequences. As your Lordships know, we are introducing a number of measures to reduce delay in the criminal justice system and are piloting the measures at present, mainly to do with straightforward guilty pleas, I agree, but also to do with enhanced case management in the magistrates' court, to which the noble Viscount referred, and starting indictable-only cases in the Crown Court.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-27_para8"></a>I do not believe--and I do not think that the noble Viscount necessarily believes--that the new clause would help to address the problems that we have discussed on a number of occasions this evening. Under Section 12 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and regulations, a time limit of 14 days is set for the preparation and service of defence statements once the prosecution has served primary prosecution disclosure, which in turn informs secondary disclosure by the prosecution of any matters which the prosecution considers might assist the defence. I agree with the noble Viscount. The conduct of the prosecution is entirely within the control of the Crown Prosecution Service, under the ultimate direction of the Director of <P>


<a name="column_1382"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1382</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Public Prosecutions, subject to anything that the Attorney-General may have to say. I agree with him that we can do things there. I do not think we ought to give the courts the power to disregard the time limit for defence statements prescribed by Parliament on this occasion because it applies in a limited range of cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-27_para9"></a>In this context, I think that what I said earlier has virtue and weight. Unless practitioners are devoted to the scheme of things which I describe, unless judges are determined, and in particular unless there is a continuity of judicial approach in a particular case, preferably by a single judge managing the case, we shall not get anywhere. The Court Service is in the process of taking forward a project to improve the effectiveness of plea and direction hearings following a review of such hearings and I hope that the judiciary will feel the benefit. I agree with the noble Viscount that a firm judicial grip is needed at preliminary hearings and pleas and directions hearings. It can significantly minimise some of the delays. If one looks, as I do sometimes, at the charts of progress in fairly similar cases at different Crown Court centres, I feel that there is no real answer to the discrepancies other than that some judges are perhaps more focused on these problems than their colleagues in other court centres.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-27_para10"></a>We intend in due course to act on the provision in the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, as amended by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, to enable the introduction of statutory time limits for the prosecution of criminal cases overall. I think that the tide has turned; I think that minds are now open to the more effective and efficient management of the system. I do not think that there is fundamentally much difference in approach between the noble Viscount and myself. I am not able to accept his amendment, as he rather foresaw, but I think that he and I share the common goals that he has identified.

That is true of foreign language interpreters and it is true of intermediaries. Occasionally an explanation may be needed--for example, an explanation of a difficult word where a simpler word might have been used, or an explanation of a word that the witness uses for a personal place or experience that otherwise would not be easily understood by the court. That is explaining what the witness meant to the court as opposed to what the questioner meant to the witness. The court can of course reject any explanation offered by the intermediary or require the intermediary to clarify the answer with the witness. The judge, magistrates, jury--if there is one--prosecution and defence lawyers will be able to see and hear the witness and the intermediary communicating.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-28_para5"></a>It is important that intermediaries understand their function clearly and that they are not there to interfere with the substance of questions and answers. I recognise that, before Clause 28 is implemented, we need to spell these matters out clearly in guidance and training. I beg to move.

<BR>
("( ) Rules of court may make provision for the appointment and appropriate training of an intermediary.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-28_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 86, I wish to say that the proposal in Clause 28 to introduce intermediaries is a bold step and one that I have no hesitation in recommending the Government to take. With proper training, an intermediary can enable a witness who would not otherwise have access to the justice system to come forward. It would also facilitate the production of quality evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-28_para9"></a>However, it is vital that the scheme is implemented carefully so that both the intermediary and the court can be assured that they are performing to standards consistent with the production of good evidence. This will take some very innovative thinking on the part of the Home Office.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-28_para10"></a>Even parents of learning disabled sons and daughters--and I am one such parent--will find it difficult to know the limits of any assistance required in a courtroom situation. I view the training and the presentation of intermediaries as essential if such services are to be reliable, safe and in the best interest of vulnerable and often frightened people who may have limited skills with which to seek out their own independent support. These issues must be addressed through guidance, which is why I propose to add an additional subsection to the Bill.

<A NAME = "90201-28_para11"></a>I would like to make one further brief point on this clause. I notice that no account has been taken of the clause within the financial impact assessment which accompanies the Bill. Undoubtedly there will be financial implications in setting up the intermediary scheme properly. I am disappointed--indeed, amazed--that central funding has not been allocated for this purpose at any stage of a case. There can be little benefit in providing support for a witness in court if the intermediary is not given support at an earlier stage, including as regards the preparation of witness statements and ensuring that a witness is familiar with court procedures. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I support this amendment purely because the intermediary who could be appointed to help someone with a mental disability may have no idea of a courtroom, or how the courts operate, or the proper procedure. They may not be all that well educated, and it would be helpful to the court if they had some training to enable the proceedings to proceed smoothly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Rix and Lord Swinfen, that training is required. That was why I indicated in the debate on the  previous amendment that before Clause 28 is implemented there will need to be proper guidelines on how intermediaries are to perform their functions and on what qualifications and training will be required. That may be flexible. It may be that a speech therapist has expertise. In some cases it may be a relative of the witness. Therefore, the training and "qualifications" are likely to differ quite significantly as between someone who is a relative of the witness, who will probably never be called upon again in his or her lifetime to be an intermediary, and a speech therapist or someone qualified to deal with the partially sighted or those with poor hearing who may well do it on a regular basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-28_para12"></a>I envisage that the guidance will set out a number of factors and criteria that the court may wish to consider when appointing an intermediary. But we believe that it is better to leave it to the court finally to exercise its discretion about whom to appoint. That is much more flexible, practical and helpful than prescriptive rules of court. Guidance would be more readily available to prospective intermediaries who would be unlikely to be legal professionals and might do it on a regular basis or might well not do it more than once. There is a degree of provision for intermediaries that falls within the existing court service allocations for expert witnesses, et cetera. That is intended to deal with the question raised about the financial memorandum. We need to be flexible to achieve the best practical outcome, and we believe that guidance rather than rules of court is the best way forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   It is getting late. I believe that at this time of the evening guidance is better than placing something on the face of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "90201-28_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: Currently, this clause stands alone and consists of a general warning to the jury against acting prejudicially towards the accused in cases where special measures have been granted. I impress upon those members of the Committee who are present the importance of incorporating an additional warning to the jury not to act prejudicially against a witness. I refer to the jury questioning the weight of a witness's evidence solely on the basis that he or she requires special measures in order to give evidence. Instances of prejudice and discrimination against people with learning disabilities are all too widespread in every sector of society. Therefore, it is unduly optimistic to believe that those prejudices will not be carried over into the courtroom by some members of the public when undertaking jury service. To add an extra warning is a necessary safeguard that should be backed up by the provision of awareness training for jurors who are involved in cases where special measures are to be employed. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-28_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Judges normally only need to give a warning to the jury in order to avoid prejudice to the defendant. That warning might cover the inferences that a jury is entitled to draw from the evidence given or from the defendant's behaviour.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-28_para21"></a>Clause 31 provides for a warning, where special measures are used, to the effect that the jury should draw no conclusions about the defendant from the fact that the special measure or measures has or have been used. We provide that because we recognise that the measures in the Bill constitute a significant change of culture for the jury as well as other participants. I do not think that it is necessary to go to the extent that the noble Lord does in the context of witnesses. The judge already has ample discretion to give directions to a jury about witnesses' competence or resolution. We have made that safeguard for the defendant because in a sense this is a change from what we had formerly and we want the defendant's position to be kept absolutely intact in its full integrity.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-28_para22"></a>I do not think that we need the amendment for adequate instruction to be given on the status of evidence to a jury in respect of a witness.

I ask him whether he considers it entirely appropriate to proceed on that discussion bearing in mind the time and the fact that inevitably the attendance is perhaps not as representative as it might be on another occasion.

<A NAME="90201-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I understand what the noble Lord says. I know that he does not say it for any trivial purpose.

My Chief Whip is not present. I do not know what the Committee wishes. I am entirely in noble Lords' hands because I genuinely wish to achieve the best outcome and the best product (I am sorry to use the jargon) for the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford </B>   moved Amendment No. 90:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 24, line 5, at beginning insert ("Without the leave of the court,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is so to amend Clause 33 that the court has a discretion to grant leave to cross-examine in person a witness who is the complainant. It is the removal of the prohibition that is starkly stated in Clause 33 and its replacement by a discretion to be exercised by the judge.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para7"></a>The consequences of a conviction for rape or a serious sexual offence are a long term of imprisonment, intolerable persecution from other prisoners within the prison, registration as a sex offender, restrictions after completion of sentence and serious public opprobrium that may last for the rest of that person's life. It might be thought that miscarriages of justice should be avoided because of the consequences for a person convicted of a sexual offence. In principle, there should be no less a burden on the prosecution to prove guilt than in any other category of case.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para8"></a>The trial cannot be conducted on the basis that the defendant is a rapist and that the complainant is a victim since the whole purpose of the trial is to determine whether that be the case. The defendant has a basic right to defend himself and to present his own case in the way he considers best. He may have reasons to distrust lawyers and, in certain situations, he may be in the best position to conduct cross-examination.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para9"></a>On Second Reading, I mentioned the possibility that a husband or partner may wish to put questions directly to his wife or partner who may be complaining of marital rape and seek to persuade her, through cross-examination, that her complaint is not a true complaint.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para10"></a>Unless the defendant's case is put to the complainant, the jury has no means of evaluating the evidence which has been brought forward. The suggestion of these provisions is that the court should appoint a barrister, but a court-appointed barrister will, in practice, be in a virtually impossible situation. He will not be acting for the defendant, who may refuse, in the circumstances, to speak to him at all. He will not be entitled to see the defendant's proof, if there is one. The defendant's case may be entirely different from that which appears in his original interview as part of the prosecution case. Should he give evidence and should his case, in giving evidence, be quite different from the interview--the information which the court-appointed barrister has--there will obviously be a necessity for the complainant to be recalled to be cross-examined again.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para11"></a>But there is no way in which the trial judge could prevent a defendant who wished to represent himself, and who had had a court-appointed lawyer thrust upon <P>


<a name="column_1388"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1388</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>him, from addressing the jury on the basis that he had not had a fair trial. He would be perfectly entitled to say to the jury, "I did not want that man. He has not asked the questions that I wanted to be asked. He has no instructions from me and my trial is therefore unfair". Should the jury agree with that as a proposition--and a jury might well do so--then the defendant might be acquitted in a case where he should not be acquitted.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para12"></a>There have been two highly-publicised cases in which defendants abused their rights to act in person in order to torment the complainant. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, the Lord Chief Justice, in the case of Brown, pointed out that the trial judge has power to protect witnesses and to control questioning. He said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The judge may, if necessary, to save the complainant from avoidable distress, stop further questioning by the defendant and take over the questioning himself. Further, if the defendant seeks by his dress or bearing, manner or questions, to dominate, intimidate or humiliate the complainant the judge should order the erection of a screen to protect the witness", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and, in the circumstances that we have been discussing earlier in Committee, the judge would be entitled to order the further giving of evidence by way of a video link or by one of the other measures contained in this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para13"></a>It is for the Minister to explain whether he believes that these measures which the Lord Chief Justice set out in that judgment are inadequate. In my judgement, it would not be satisfactory, if the purpose of this provision is to do something rather than nothing, to use the phrase of the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, earlier this evening. It is not enough that this provision should go in as window dressing if there is already adequate provision in the judgment in the Brown case to cover the position of a complainant.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para14"></a>The position taken by myself, although not for the moment by my party, in Amendment No. 90 is to leave the control of the proceeding in the hands of the trial judge, who can evaluate the particular situation in the case. Perhaps I may make a general point. It seems to me that, over the past few years, Parliament has interfered with the discretion of judges not simply in matters of sentencing--and this is an obvious example--but in the exercise of their general discretion to control and run their courts. I believe that the provisions in Clause 33 are unnecessary. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-29_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   Before we continue the debate, perhaps I may say that I missed the earlier remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder. I believe it has been agreed that this group should be split at Amendment No. 95 and that we should discuss the group of Amendments Nos. 90 to 94. Then we should go to the group containing Amendment Nos. 95 to 134 and finish there. We should then continue with Clause 35 on Monday, if that is agreeable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-29_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Mallalieu: </B>   Amendment No. 92 stands in the name of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice, the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, and myself. It is grouped with this amendment. Therefore, in speaking to that amendment, perhaps I may say something in relation to the amendment which the noble Lord has just moved.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para15"></a>At Second Reading on 15 December, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, said in relation to this Bill,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are approaching this with a genuinely open mind. If your Lordships table amendments that are consistent with the theme and philosophy of the Bill I undertake to give each one [decent] consideration".--[Official Report, 15/12/98; col. 1239.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In outlining the philosophy behind Clause 33, the noble Lord started from the position which I would ask him at the outset to reconsider. In relation to complaints of rape and certain other sexual offences, he said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We owe a duty to the victims of those distressing crimes to ensure that they are not victimised afresh when they come to court. Clause 33 and 34 are designed to fulfil our duty which, in the past, has not been fulfilled".--[col. 1238.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I begin by saying that what I go on to say is in no way to disagree with the noble Lord that no witness, whether truthful or otherwise who comes before the court, should be bullied, intimidated or threatened. Indeed, when a witness is lying, in my experience that fact is more likely to become clear to those in court if he is relaxed and as at ease as possible in the course of giving evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para16"></a>However, when the Minister used those remarks in outlining this part of the Bill on Second Reading, he appeared to be basing his approach on a presumption that the witness is a victim. The purpose of a contested trial is to determine whether or not that is so. The accused may instead be the victim of a false allegation. We must indeed find ways, as this Bill does, in which we can enable a witness to give evidence more easily so that the court can better determine where the truth lies. But in framing changes in criminal legislation it is easy to fall into the trap of assuming guilt on the part of the accused. Some witnesses may need more help. We are all agreed about that and other parts of the Bill provide for it. However, that does not mean that those who are or may be falsely accused need fewer safeguards or to have their rights eroded. And we must be vigilant to see that that does not happen, despite our best intentions, in these provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para17"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord, Lord Williams, bracketed child witnesses, to which Clause 34 applies, together with adult witnesses in sexual cases. I am sure that he did not intend to be either patronising or insulting because we in this House know him well and we know that that is not his way. Children need special protection in our courts. They are without exception under a disability by reason of age. I have no objection to the extension of that protection; indeed, I welcome it. They are less well able to give evidence; they may require specialist cross-examination to elicit the truth; and the <P>


<a name="column_1390"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1390</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>courts rightly take special powers to ensure that justice is done. However, adult victims of sexual offences do not form a category of people giving evidence under a disability. They come from every background and every level of education. Most, but not all, are women. Some are robust, others are not. They are not under a disability as of class and it is patronising to treat them as though they are.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para18"></a>Of course, very few people relish the idea of giving evidence in any case, particularly in a sexual case which may be acutely embarrassing. But some witnesses are not deterred, and indeed are anxious, to confront their attackers face to face and play their part in seeing that justice is done. When offered the opportunity to have her statement read rather than come to court and give evidence live, I have known a witness in a serious sexual case insist that she wished to give evidence in person in court in the face of her attacker. And she was indeed a devastating witness.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para19"></a>When an adult witness is vulnerable and likely to be prevented from giving evidence satisfactorily if cross-examined by the accused in person, Section 35 gives the court powers to restrict the defendant's right to ask the questions. But that is a different matter and it may well be appropriate in some cases. However, Clause 33 does something which is quite different. It imposes an absolute prohibition with no discretion. It allows for no consideration of the wishes or needs of a witness or of the interests of justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para20"></a>The objections to an absolute prohibition, a mandatory ban, are, frankly, these. First, it is a drastic step to deprive an accused person of the right to conduct his own defence. He may dislike or distrust lawyers, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said. He may feel that he can do a better job himself and he may be right about that. He may feel that if he can put his questions directly himself he may elicit the truth where others may fail. Again--forgive the anecdote--I recall a case where the defendant, accused of rape after an argument by someone with whom he had been living, insisted on questioning her himself. It took no more than very few questions, put gently and courteously, before she admitted that the allegation had been made in temper and out of spite, and was now regretted and withdrawn. She was not prepared to continue the lie to that man's face.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para21"></a>The reality of a refusal to allow an accused to cross-examine in person is that he may well afterwards, if he is told that he must have a counsel to represent him, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, has already said, quite frankly refuse to co-operate with the lawyer assigned to him. We are of course talking here about a defendant who has already refused legal representation. He may fail to instruct his counsel adequately or at all, so that in effect his case goes by default. The jury will almost certainly be aware in his final speech that he has been prevented from conducting his own defence in cross-examination and may well regard that as unfair and treat his case with particular sympathy.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para22"></a>Is it, I ask, necessary to deprive all defendants of that right in every case of this type? I think not. Reference has already been made to the two cases--both of them <P>


<a name="column_1391"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1391</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bad cases, both of them attracting extensive publicity and both of them occurring two years plus ago. On 7th May last year the Court of Appeal gave clear guidance to judges faced with this situation, and gave them clear directions as to the steps which they could take, and indeed indicated quite clearly that the Court of Appeal would back judges who, in an appropriate case, stopped a defendant from asking direct questions and indeed stopped him in advance of asking questions, if they had good reason to think that his right to do so would be abused.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para23"></a>Since that date there has been no further problem. There were, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, failures in the past, but in May of last year the Court of Appeal put them right. It is very rare indeed for a defendant to seek to cross-examine himself. Most of them have the good sense to use a trained advocate and, apart from those two cases, I know of no instance where a defendant has intimidated witnesses in that way since. It may be said that public perception is that this happens frequently and so victims are discouraged from coming forward to give evidence. If that is the public perception it is a misconception, and legislation, particularly where it takes away a basic right from the defence, should not be based upon public misconception.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para24"></a>The remedy surely is to acquaint the public with the facts, which are two cases only and action by the Court of Appeal, since when no further problems have arisen. It may be said that victims need to be reassured that this cannot happen and that an attacker will not be permitted to cross-examine. I am sure that many more potential witnesses would be encouraged to come forward if they could be reassured that no one would cross-examine them or question their account at all. But cross-examination is, as we all recognise, a safeguard--indeed the main safeguard--for the wrongly accused against false conviction.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-29_para25"></a>Amendment No. 92, in my name, does not go as far as others in this group. It merely asks that Clause 33 shall not come into force unless and until the Secretary of State, in the light of experience, certifies that it is necessary to protect witnesses. There is no evidence that that is the case today. If the position changes later he can say so, and have his way. It is a very modest amendment and I hope it is one which will find favour. As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said at Second Reading, it is surely wise to wait and see if a further remedy is needed before depriving judges of the discretion to control proceedings in their courts, fortified as they are now by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, in the way that they think best.

<A NAME="90201-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wigoder: </B>   I rise to support Amendment No. 92 with a marginal preference for that amendment rather than the other amendments in this group. I feel strongly that, unamended, Clause 33 ought not to be allowed to stand.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para0"></a>Like several others Members of your Lordships' Committee, I speak from a lifetime's experience at the criminal Bar, sometimes prosecuting, sometimes defending and sometimes trying cases in which, from <P>


<a name="column_1392"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1392</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time to time, sexual offences were involved. I hope therefore that the Committee will consider my next few sentences to be relevant to our discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para1"></a>Over that lifetime I came to have a huge respect for our jury system. I believe that on almost every occasion juries returned the appropriate verdict in accordance with the weight of the evidence. But I am bound to say that over that period too there were cases where the verdict surprised me. I have no evidence as to why juries occasionally return such verdicts because evidence is not permitted as to what takes place in a jury room--I am glad that is so--even though that upsets some slightly dyspeptic academics and journalists.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para2"></a>But looking back over those cases, I detected a perfectly clear pattern of the cases in which juries did not convict, even though the evidence appeared to be overwhelming. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, and the noble Lord, Lord Bach, will all have had similar experiences. They were cases in which the jury detected that something was wrong. For example, they included cases in which the penalty, if there were to be a conviction, would have been totally disproportionate to the offence. Those cases ranged from a capital murder charge where the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter because they felt that there was strong mitigation on behalf of the defendant, to a much lesser case where the Chief Officer of Police was charged with shoplifting some petty item from Woolworths, and the jury acquitted because, should there be a conviction--never mind the sentence the court would impose--there would be a penalty not only of the loss of his job, but also the loss of his pension.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para3"></a>There were frequently cases where the jury felt that the power of the state was being used unreasonably to oppress the ordinary citizen in a matter in which it was apparent to everybody that the ordinary citizen appeared to have been acting in the public interest. I remember a number of cases under the old Official Secrets Acts where juries returned acquittals though there was perfectly clear evidence to the contrary.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para4"></a>There were cases where the prosecution had seemed to act unfairly; where they had been discovered half-way through the case to have concealed some evidence that they ought to have disclosed to the defence. There were cases where witnesses for the prosecution were prejudiced and biased and discriminatory in their evidence, however weighty it might be. An obvious example of that, perhaps, is the O. J. Simpson trial heard recently in the United States. There were even cases--I hasten to use the past tense in the presence of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice--where judges on occasion appeared to be prejudiced in their summings-up in an attempt to secure convictions.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para5"></a>In all those classes of case from time to time the jury would return verdicts of not guilty, despite apparently overwhelming evidence. I am in no doubt that the reason was that the juries, apart from the oath that they had taken, looked at something rather more important; that is, they looked at what they perceived to be the interests of justice and what they perceived to be the fairness of the trial and the fairness of the result. If that is right, let <P>


<a name="column_1393"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1393</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>us apply that situation to that which will now arise if trials are carried out in accordance with the procedure that is conceived by Clause 33.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para6"></a>It is accepted by everybody that a defendant has a complete right to defend himself. Under the clause he still has that right. The right is not refused or abolished. However, there may be certain penalties attached if the defendant insists on enforcing his right. He has a complete right to defend himself or, if he has a legal representative, to dismiss that representative summarily in the middle of the trial if he wants to do so, without giving any reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para7"></a>Jurors see a rape case as a case in which the parties start level. They do not see it in the way that some publicists tend to analyse such cases. They do not assume from the very beginning that the man in the dock is a violent sex pervert and that the girl in the witness box is a chaste and comely maid. They start with no preconceived notions and listen to the evidence produced. What happens? In due course, the girl gives her evidence and the defendant, representing himself, as is his right, is told, "No, sorry; you can't ask any questions". What will the jury think? Let us suppose that it turns out later that the defendant has an alibi and says, "I wasn't there. Somebody else interfered with you, if your account of the interference is true". But the defendant is not allowed to put that. It is no good saying, as is said in one of the later clauses, that the judge can appoint a lawyer to act on behalf of the unrepresented defendant against his will and to put what seem to be appropriate questions. How on earth does a lawyer, seeking to represent someone in that situation, without any instructions, know where to start? How does the lawyer know whether the defence is one of consent, mistaken identity, or whatever?
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para8"></a>In the result, I believe that the jury will instinctively react in some cases--not in every case; I do not want to exaggerate--saying, "This procedure is unfair. This man is in the dock and he is presumed at this moment to be innocent. He cannot put his defence because he is not allowed to".
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para9"></a>It does not end there. Although the unrepresented defendant is not allowed to cross-examine the complainant, he has a total and complete right at the end of the case to make a speech from the dock. That can be a formidable experience. I recall a Minister of the Crown who spoke for five days solidly in such circumstances. It is very difficult for the judge to interrupt a defendant who is making a speech in his own defence from the dock, without also appearing to the jury to be not entirely impartial. A reasonably plausible defendant can say a lot of things in a speech from the dock when he will not be cross-examined, such as why he was not allowed to ask questions, how unfair it was and if only he had been allowed to ask questions, he would have challenged this, that and the other and perhaps have called evidence about this, that and the other.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para10"></a>It is not in the least difficult to envisage a scenario in which in those circumstances a defendant could gain the sympathy of the jury. The jurors would be solidly on his side and when in due course they returned a verdict, <P>


<a name="column_1394"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1394</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there would be a real danger that, however strong the evidence, from time to time, in some cases but not all, they may say, "This system is unfair and we are going to show that it is unfair by returning a verdict of "not guilty". That is what I fear will happen if Clause 33 becomes effective as it stands.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para11"></a>There are alternatives to the difficult problem of unrepresented defendants starting to "misbehave", if you like, to ask oppressive questions and to frighten and upset witnesses. There are now perfectly clear guidelines laid down by the Lord Chief Justice in the case of Brown which mean that the judge is in control of the case. In other words, the judge can take control of the case without the drastic measures that are suggested in Clause 33.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para12"></a>I remember one occasion, many years ago, when such a problem arose while I was trying a sexual offence case. The defendant was incessantly cross-examining the girl in the witness box and I was constrained to say to him, "Look, you have asked that question seven times now. I'll allow you to ask it once more, but then we've got to move on to something else. I am sorry to have to tell you, but if you won't take my advice and do what I suggest there will be no alternative but to ask you to finish your evidence and cease any further questioning". Fortunately, the defendant took the advice. He asked the question once more, received exactly the same answer and then moved on to another topic. Thus the trial proceeded to its end. Although the defendant was convicted, there was never any suggestion that I, as the judge in the case, was behaving improperly--and there were no guidelines in existence to support me.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para13"></a>However, at this stage when the problem is fully recognised and when the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal has made it perfectly clear that it will strongly support the efforts of judges to control the evil which is being aimed at by the clause, I believe that the powers that the judges have will now be entirely adequate and will prevent this from happening. If the clause is passed, I fear that, as a result of the operation of its provisions, there may well be acquittals in several nasty cases of rape where verdicts of guilty would be fully justified on the evidence.

<A NAME="90201-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   I find myself in a position of some embarrassment. In the first place, I could not attend the Second Reading debate because I was abroad and I very much regret that fact. Secondly, I am going to disagree with my noble friend Lord Thomas. As he said, putting it very tactfully, our party in this Chamber has no official position on the matter at this stage. Therefore, in a sense, we are speaking for ourselves. Thirdly, I am not a member of the criminal Bar, although I sat as an assistant recorder and a recorder for 10 years. There may perhaps be some advantage in my not being a member of the criminal Bar. I love my colleagues from the criminal Bar, but I am bound to say that I find them somewhat conservative when it comes to doing anything to change the traditional elements of evidence and procedure in criminal trials; indeed, even more conservative than I and my colleagues on the civil side.
<P>


<a name="column_1395"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1395</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para14"></a>I shall address my remarks to something that I know a little about; namely, why I do not think that there is any violation of the fundamental right of the accused to a fair trial involved in Clause 33, why I think that there is no conceivable breach of the European human rights convention and why, if something like this provision is not in place, I think that there will be clear violations of the human rights convention--at any rate, if anything like the scandals that occurred in the two notorious cases were ever to happen again.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para15"></a>As the Committee knows, the impetus for Clause 33 springs from the 1996 rape trial of Mr. Ralston Edwards, who chose to conduct his own defence and then deliberately used the trial to embark upon a humiliating and intimidating cross-examination of his victim for several days while wearing the very same clothes that he had worn when he committed the offence. Naturally his victim suffered extreme emotional and psychological distress at being questioned in such a manner. She complained to the European Commission of Human Rights in Strasbourg of a breach of her right not to be subjected to degrading treatment. I believe that the case is progressing rather well from her point of view. In my view, it is very probable, if not certain, that the United Kingdom will be found to have breached the convention, including the positive obligation to ensure that such abuses do not occur.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para16"></a>A year after the abuse of the criminal justice process in the Edwards trial, another rapist was able to follow the example set by Mr. Edwards. Once again the courtroom was abused publicly to subject victims, in the words of the trial judge,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to merciless cross-examination clearly designed only to intimidate and humiliate them", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
there being several victims on this occasion. Those cases badly damaged public confidence in the administration of justice in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para17"></a>My noble friends Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Wigoder and the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, all, I am sure, agree that such abuses of our criminal justice system must not be allowed ever to happen again for the sake both of the victims and of public confidence in our criminal justice system. We must not let our courtrooms be used to scare or intimidate victims of crime so that they are deterred by the ordeal of a humiliating trial from complaining or testifying.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para18"></a>A judge has a difficult task in controlling an unrepresented defendant. I have listened carefully to what has been said so far and I think nothing that has been said suggests otherwise. There are no codes of ethics, no training in questioning standards and legal tests of relevance, and no measures of censure that can be imposed on a non-lawyer who chooses to conduct his own defence. Nor are there many means available to a  judge to control the nature and manner of a non-lawyer's questions when that judge is all too aware that too much control before a jury--as the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, has pointed out in a different context--can prejudice the fairness of a trial and its outcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para19"></a>For those reasons, I respectfully disagree with the amendments which oppose Clause 33 because of a wish to test the guidelines recently given by the Court of <P>


<a name="column_1396"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1396</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Appeal, Criminal Division. Those guidelines are most welcome. They invoke what is the inherent power of a judge--a power which judges have always had--to prevent abuses occurring in a courtroom. However, that inherent power did not assist the victims in two tragic cases. I believe that the guidelines, although most welcome, are a less sure guide than the guide given by Parliament in legislation. I do not think it is good enough to leave matters to the trial judge, even with the welcome guidelines, when there is a pressing need to restore public confidence in the administration of justice in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para20"></a>It is, I think, entirely appropriate for Parliament to legislate to implement the obligations imposed by the European human rights convention. I do not think anything in Clause 33 usurps judicial functions or breaches separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government. I think it is for Parliament to make the laws relating to evidence and procedure, and for the courts to interpret and apply the law.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para21"></a>Of course it is common ground that an accused has a fundamental right to a fair trial, but that is not the only fundamental right that must be protected in the administration of justice. Victims of crime have a right to be treated with dignity and respect and a right to have their personal privacy respected. Letting alleged sex offenders question their alleged victims directly in a publicly provided forum does not protect those competing rights. A properly proportionate balance has to be found and I believe that the Government's proposals achieve that balance without infringing the convention. The Bill does not take away a basic right of the accused, as I hope briefly to explain in the context of the convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para22"></a>The Bill was introduced with a single sentence statement made under Section 19 of the Human Rights Act that the Minister considers its provisions to be compatible with the convention. But the statement did not explain the Minister's reasons for reaching that conclusion. I therefore sought the reasons and the Minister gave them to me in a letter of 18th January 1999, for which I am grateful. As he knows, I hope it will be possible in future for the Government to find a practical way of giving reasons of this kind systematically when a government Bill is published, so that Second Reading debates can be better informed and the matter does not have to be dealt with in the way I am about to deal with it. This is presently the only practical way in which the House can be informed of the Government's reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para23"></a>The noble Lord's letter explained that, in drawing up the provisions in Chapter II, the Government gave careful thought to whether they were compatible with the provisions of Article 6 and the right of the defendant to receive a fair trial. Article 6.3(d) states that the accused has the right,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to examine or have examined witnesses against him". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He also has the right under Article 6.3(c),
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1397"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1397</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
But, as the Minister pointed out, Article 6.3 does not confer an absolute right to instruct a representative of one's choosing nor to benefit from state funding regardless of means. Nor does Article 6.3(d) preclude a national requirement to be represented in criminal proceedings. The case of Croissant v. Germany supports those views.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para24"></a>And, of course, witnesses too have rights under Articles 3 and 8 of the convention. Those articles set out their right to protection from cruel and inhuman treatment and unwarranted intrusion into their private lives. Aggressive, humiliating and unnecessarily prurient questioning of a complainant by an accused person would, as the Minister pointed out--and I agree--raise issues under Articles 3 and 8.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para25"></a>The Government therefore believe, and I share their belief, that the provisions of Clause 33 and the following clauses will provide greater protection in future cases. The Government also believe (and again I share their belief) that the provisions strike an appropriate balance between the right of the accused to a fair trial and the interests of the witness and his or her right to protection under the convention. The Minister drew attention to the case of Doorson v. Netherlands in regard to the need to balance the witnesses and victims against the interests of the accused. He quoted from paragraph 70 of that judgment, which is very helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para26"></a>I agree with those reasons and with the Government's belief that the provisions in Clauses 33 to 39 are fully compatible with the convention. There is no absolute right of the accused, whether at common law or under the convention, to conduct his defence as he pleases even if he does so in a manner which abuses the rights of his alleged victim. Indeed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal indicates as much in giving guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para27"></a>It is said that there is no need for reform given the rarity of such cases. Yet, surely the serious abuse suffered by one victim, let alone three (Mr. Brown questioned two victims) is enough to demonstrate the need for change. There may well be a positive obligation on the Government under the European Convention to take steps to ensure that no other witnesses are so brutally treated in our courts.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para28"></a>The provisions of Clause 33 are well-balanced, circumscribed and necessary. The amendments tabled in this group would emasculate those provisions, whether by leaving the matter, as at present, to the discretion of the trial judge, or postponing the coming into force of Clause 33 until some unspecified future date.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para29"></a>The Home Secretary does not have a monopoly of wisdom. No one does. But he and his colleagues have decided that these provisions are appropriate and necessary to restore public confidence. I see no reason why Parliament should refrain from enacting Clause 33.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-30_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The principles at stake in this debate are about as big and as good as principles can be. On the one hand, there is the need to protect those who are victims of superior power; on the other, there is the need of the accused for the best possible defence and for the <P>


<a name="column_1398"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1398</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>presumption of innocence while that defence is conducted. Both are the kinds of interest that one might be tempted to describe as paramount. But one cannot have two paramount principles. That is the ground of the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para30"></a>One could approach the debate in one of two ways. One could argue about which of these principles is more important. I am extremely reluctant to take that approach because a decision in favour of either on a question so big would, I think, tip the balance of justice quite inadmissibly one way or the other. I should therefore prefer to approach the debate by asking which of these principles is likely to be more damaged by a decision against it in this case.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para31"></a>I am in total agreement with my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford that one cannot conduct a trial on the assumption that the accused is a rapist. My noble friend knows, and I think the Committee knows, perhaps rather better than I might have wished, that that is a principle for which I have in the past contended. What is not quite so widely known is that I have not only attempted to defend a male pupil unjustly accused of rape but have also advised no fewer than three female pupils who had been victims of it. I think I can claim to have tried, within my limited sphere, to apply the principles of natural justice and to hear both sides.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para32"></a>It is notoriously difficult to persuade women who have been victims of rape to take their cases to court. I advised all three of those women to do so. I mention the cases now only because I believe it is too long ago for there to be any risk of their being identified. I was successful in one case out of the three in which I advised the women to take their cases to court. The first advice I gave to the woman was: "If you go to court, you do not do it for your own sake, you do it for the sake of the next woman who comes along". When she came out of the witness box, the first thing she said at the beginning of an hour-long international telephone conversation was: "I am extremely glad you gave me that advice. It was true".
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para33"></a>Going to court to make this kind of complaint is painful and difficult at the best of times. Discouraging women from coming forward is distressingly easy. We are told that there are only two such cases of the kind complained of. So far that is true. The risk of copycats is real. I would not mind placing a bet that, if the evidence were discoverable, the number of women who have already been deterred from coming forward by the very considerable publicity given to those two cases would probably be found to be several hundred times that number. That is a real blow to the interests of justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para34"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, said, perfectly correctly, that some women are not deterred from coming forward and from the confrontation. That is true. But, with respect, I do not think that that is good enough. To say that some people can get over the hurdle is not to deny the allegation that the hurdle may be placed too high in the first place. The form of the noble Baroness's statement conceded that there are many women who are deterred. I therefore hope that we can take that as common ground.
<P>


<a name="column_1399"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1399</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para35"></a>What of the effect that this provision might have on the rights of the accused? If it seriously damaged the interests of the accused, that would clearly be a fatal objection. Again I turn to the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu. She said that most accused people had the good sense to use a trained advocate. I do not think that people who use a trained advocate necessarily handicap their defence. Many things have been said in criticism of lawyers--though not by me--but I do not think it has ever been said that, as a general principle, those who employ lawyers are less likely to be acquitted than those who do not. In fact, it is a regular proverb that a barrister who conducts his own defence has a fool for his client.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para36"></a>On one memorable occasion, a highly colourful public figure--whom I will not name in deference to the Rules of Order--was arrested for driving at 120 miles per hour on a motorway. When the case came to court, The Times rather prudently said "Mr. So and So, who is a barrister, conducted his own defence". The said person lost the case--as indeed one might have expected. I do not think the litigant in person--by doing it that way--necessarily increases his chances of acquittal. If he employs an advocate, his chances of acquittal may be increased.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para37"></a>The other point which deeply concerns me is that we misunderstand rape if we take it simply as a sexual offence; it is more an offence of violence than a sexual offence. There is a very real risk--more than in any comparable type of crime that I can think of--that the sheer act of cross-examination may be used as a way of repeating the offence. It is that point about the accused being allowed to cross-examine which really sticks in my gullet. In these cases I think that he does not do it in the hope of an acquittal; he does it in the hope of inflicting future pain. That is something I really do not like.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para38"></a>I have read the directions of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham. They are good directions. But the difficulty with any attempt to control the behaviour of a cross-examiner by judicial direction is that one cannot know what question will be asked until it is asked. When one reads cases in the very different American atmosphere, one is constantly reading reports that "So and So should be stricken from the record". Once a question has been asked, even if the cross-examiner is restrained, the shock or pain created is already there--it is too late to undo it--and the deterrent effect remains on any future person who may wish to complain, even if the question is ruled out of order.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para39"></a>My noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford drew attention to the risk of people refusing to instruct. It is indeed a risk. So is the risk of people refusing to plead. One cannot stop them doing that; they do it at their own risk. If they wish to do it, they have to be free to do so, even if they know that they suffer from it. Nobody can force the accused to act in his own best interests; we can only do everything we can to make it possible for him to do so if he wants to. I believe that employing a trained advocate normally would be in his best interests.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bingham of Cornhill: </B>   Your Lordships are all agreed that Clause 33 is directed towards an abuse--but it is an abuse that has only been demonstrated to occur on two occasions; no one has so far unearthed any other examples. Following these two very highly publicised cases, everyone feared that there would be copycat examples. There have not been. Your Lordships know that in the second case the Court of Appeal did all that it possibly could to strengthen the arm of judges, and to make it plain to all concerned that they had the power to stamp on this abuse. There has been no further example.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para41"></a>Because it is an abuse, the noble Baroness Lady Mallalieu, the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, and I have tabled an amendment which recognises that if the guidance given by the Court of Appeal proves ineffective something more needs to be done. We do not say, or invite the Committee to say, that we should get on with it, that it is not too bad and we can put up with it. We recognise that if the abuse continues something must be done. But we must hope--at present we have every reason to believe--that the advice that has been given will prove to be effective. As has been pointed out, two years have passed without further copycat examples. We urge the Committee to accept that if the advice proves to be effective it is unwise to introduce a measure that deprives the court of discretion to control its own proceedings in the interests of justice--after all, that is what the judge is there for--and involves the appointment of a legal representative who is not responsible to the accused and very probably is not in receipt of instructions from him.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para42"></a>I believe that I take words out of the mouth of the Minister when I say that no one can cross-examine efficaciously and professionally without instructions. That is true. These are not technical points; nor are they an example of judges defending their turf or of amour propre. These questions are related directly to the administration of justice. Those of us who hope that it will not be necessary to bring this provision into force do so because we believe that it opens the door to the risk of unjust convictions. We believe that the jury will not have heard the complainant appropriately cross-examined. It also opens the door to the risk of unjust acquittal for the reason given by the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder; namely, that the jury may feel that the defendant has not had a chance.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para43"></a>It is no answer to say that in order to find himself in this situation the defendant needs to be awkward, truculent and stupid. He may be so, but it is not a crime under the laws of this country to be awkward, truculent and stupid, and certainly not a crime for which he may be sent to prison for many years on end.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-30_para44"></a>I have never suggested in this House or anywhere that the provision is contrary to the European convention. The argument of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, is one that I readily accept. But it is not so long since what gripped <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the popular press and rightly engaged the attention of your Lordships was the series of unjust convictions which were a blemish not simply on the criminal justice system but on our national life. This House must act at all costs to avert the risk of miscarriages of justice. It is for that reason that I, in company with the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, believe it to be urgently important that this provision should not be brought into force unless and until it is clearly shown by practical experience to be needed.

<A NAME="90201-31_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   I had not intended to participate in the debate this evening. I shall be brief. As I listened to the debate I wondered what women who had been victims of rape would feel on hearing a report of tonight's proceedings. I am quite sure that many of them would be deterred from taking their cases to court. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said that one wanted to avoid unjust convictions. Of course that is so. One understands the sincerity of noble Lords who have defended the right to a fair trial, but what about the woman who is afraid and deterred from taking her case to court? That has been a common occurrence in the past and one does not want it to continue in future.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para0"></a>I think that it was my noble friend who said that the accused may not receive a fair trial because he refused to appoint an advocate. That would be his choice. The accused would be able to defend himself to the point of cross-examining the woman who was bringing the case of rape. Like the noble Earl, Lord Russell, I believe that if there is to be a balance it should be on her side. Under this clause, there is the possibility of a fair trial without the accused being able to cross-examine the victim in the way that occurred in the two cases referred to. I believe that the majority of women in the country would want this clause to stand as it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-31_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws: </B>   The Lord Chief Justice spoke of the great concern about miscarriages of justice. I think that many women in this country believe that miscarriages of justice take place all too often when it comes to the trial of rape.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para1"></a>I believe that an important moment has arrived with this legislation. The Government seek to strike the balance between human rights and civil liberties. It is interesting that it is happening now because we are introducing human rights legislation into this country. That poses an intellectual challenge to us as lawyers in the courts of thinking a different way. Some of my colleagues from the criminal Bar may somewhat lag behind in their consideration of human rights principles.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para2"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said, in consideration of rape we necessarily have a tension between two principles: between the human rights issues raised on behalf of the complainant and the civil liberty issues of protecting defendants' rights. The happy resolution found here is charting a very subtle course between those two positions. We are not abandoning here the rights of defendants to a fair trial, of proper representations, to be tried to a high standard of proof, and that they are considered innocent until proved guilty. Here we have the charting of a course between <P>


<a name="column_1402"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inflexible legislative rules and wholly untrammelled judicial discretion. We know that the former threatens the rights of defendants and that the latter ignores the needs of complainants. But here one has a resolution which seeks to track a middle course. I suggest that the amendments are not taken into consideration by the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, spoke of the intolerable effects of conviction for rape. I agree with him. It is terrible if there is a miscarriage of justice. But in considering that, we also have to have in mind the intolerable effect of intimate cross-examination on a woman if she has been violated and if that cross-examination has been conducted by the person who violated her. The noble Earl spoke effectively about that balancing act. We have to bear that in mind. That is the failing by my colleagues from the criminal Bar.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para4"></a>Sometimes cross-examination can contain menace even when it is conducted without a threatening tone. I was surprised at the suggestion that it might be a good thing if a husband or former husband were able to cross-examine his wife where there is an allegation of rape. That is precisely the kind of circumstance where there can be intimidation and a woman can withdraw her complaint because of fear of what might follow on conviction.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para5"></a>I have acted on behalf of the accused in many cases of rape. I have also been involved in advising those who have been victims of rape; for example, in seeking compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. I was indeed the lawyer to whom the noble Earl, Lord Russell, turned when his student was falsely accused. My advice was that which I believe any criminal lawyer, believing in the system, would give; namely, that it would be wrong for him to be asked to leave his university without a trial and that he should insist that the case went to court. That was done in that case and he was properly acquitted.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para6"></a>In the same way, I have to balance my concern on behalf of women with that on behalf of defendants. I have always resisted the demands of some of the women concerned about rape cases that I should never defend in such trials. I have always believed that in my role as a lawyer I should abide by the cab rank principle and acknowledge the experience which comes from acting in such cases. I, too, know the suffering that flows from women feeling the loss of justice and the way in which that leads to a loss of confidence in the criminal justice system generally. I know that from speaking to women's organisations throughout the country. There was a general sense that such cases do not take account of the pain and anguish that women experience in the courtroom.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para7"></a>It is interesting that the Lord Chief Justice said that there had been only two cases, and yet, in making submissions to this Committee, both the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, and the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, spoke of two different cases, which were obviously not the ones reported so heavily in the press. They spoke of defendants acting for themselves and cross-examining the victims. The two most recent cases were shocking. <P>


<a name="column_1403"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1403</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>But over the years there have been other shocking cases. There will continue to be such cases if steps are not taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para8"></a>I take great pleasure in the fact that this Government have sought to act in securing the confidence of women in the system. It is my belief that this clause does that and also the later clauses which seek to reduce cross-examination on sexual history. We have to see the context. It is about the mythology and the stereotyping that go into these cases and the way in which judicial discretion has not protected women in the past. I say to my noble friend Lord Wigoder that eight questions are seven questions too many of the victim in a case of this kind. That does not speak too well of judicial discretion if matters are left as late as that before there is an intervention. This is a good clause and I commend it to the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   After such an expert and experienced debate I am hesitant to intervene, but that is not going to put me off. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said that he was not speaking for his party, which subsequently became apparent in the debate. I do not believe that this is a party matter. We all speak for ourselves, I certainly do. In any event, I believe that our aims in this matter are the same. They are to balance the very difficult dilemma clearly put to us by the noble Earl, Lord Russell. There is the need to protect women from humiliation--particularly from the terrible experiences mentioned in the cases which have been referred to--in contrast to the need not to prejudice a fair trial. That is a very real and difficult dilemma for us. It is a difficult choice to make.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para9"></a>On reflection, having heard the debate, I prefer the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, supported by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice and the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, to those in my name. But all the amendments go in the same general direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para10"></a>The first question to which we must give attention is whether there will be copy-cat cases. We had some reassurance in respect of that from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice which I found reassuring. In any event, the reason that I prefer Amendment No. 92 is that it provides protection against the possibility of further copy-cat cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para11"></a>But the next and more difficult question is as regards how we avoid other women being deterred by the publicity that there was for those two cases in particular and the general publicity surrounding them. It is extremely important to try to do that. It is clear that many women are understandably deterred from pursuing cases and that is not in the interests of justice. It seems to me that that can be matched only by publicity in the opposite direction. I doubt whether our agreement to this clause, as opposed to the rest of the Bill, will do much in relation to that publicity. It is a much larger matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para12"></a>The next question which we must address is whether the accused would be denied, by this clause, the opportunity to defend himself properly. I accept entirely the arguments that have been used about the  European Convention on Human Rights. As I <P>


<a name="column_1404"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1404</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>understand it, as explained in a letter that I too received from the Minister after Second Reading, that seems to be satisfied provided that a court-appointed lawyer can cross-examine. That provision is essential to the ECHR. But obviously that is a matter which we shall discuss later in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para13"></a>The final question is whether, if we do not agree to the clause as printed in the Bill going onto the statute book, we shall have done enough to protect women against the humiliation that there was in those publicised cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para14"></a>The first judgment we must make is whether the Court of Appeal's actions have so far been sufficient. So far as we can tell, in the time which has elapsed since the Court of Appeal made its decisions, they have been sufficient to protect women. But, in any event, within the Bill itself, in other clauses, we are going much further in relation to protecting women in that situation. We have already discussed the clause dealing with special measures--screens, videos and so on--which can be used to protect women, in this case, during cross-examination. On another occasion, we shall discuss the question of consent and so on which is dealt with in later clauses.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para15"></a>Therefore, if we do not agree to this clause unamended, it is not that we are doing nothing to address those problems. On the contrary, we are taking some extremely effective steps to address them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-31_para16"></a>That brings me back to the question of whether the accused will be denied the opportunity to defend himself properly. It is a difficult question, but at least for the time being I come down on the side of Amendment No. 92. We should have the clause on the statute book as a fall back in case the actions that have already been taken by the Court of Appeal and those that we are taking in other parts of the Bill do not prove to be a sufficient safeguard in the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I am grateful for the tone and content of everything that has been said. I prosecuted and defended in rape cases and I know that the memory never leaves one in a way that is different from other serious cases. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, is a generous-hearted man, but he says that women may be put off from complaining of rape. I do not believe that that grasps the true dimension. I do not believe that it begins to describe the deep, bitter distress and humiliation that women feel at the prospect of--I underline that--being cross-examined by the alleged perpetrator.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said that I promised to look at these matters with an open mind and I continue to do so, but the more I have listened to the arguments tonight the more I have been fortified in my view, which I did not reach lightly, that Clause 33 is correctly included in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, also said that there might be a danger of a man being unable to defend himself properly. That cannot arise. The only prohibition is that he shall not be allowed to cross-examine the complainant in person. These are very important matters. There is no question that a defendant cannot <P>


<a name="column_1405"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1405</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>defend himself properly. He can have a court appointed lawyer for the appropriate part of the cross-examination--that is the prohibited part of Clause 33--he can have the lawyer, at legal aid, of his reasonable choice to defend himself throughout. That is no inhibition against defending himself properly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para2"></a>We have already come to the policy conclusion, which none of your Lordships from any quarter of this Chamber has challenged tonight, that in cases involving children the benefit, as it is, of allowing a defendant the freedom to conduct his defence in the way he chooses does not outweigh the distress of being cross-examined by an unrepresented defendant. No one has raised a question about that tonight and I fortify myself, I believe open-mindedly, with the arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para3"></a>What perhaps has not been grasped tonight is the very powerful deterrent--my noble friend Lady Kennedy made this point--that the possibility of being cross-examined by a defendant can have on witnesses considering those agonising circumstances described by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, as to whether they can face giving evidence in court. I recognise--I have said it often enough in this House--that not all defendants are guilty, but they have then to contemplate the moral burden of dreadful wrong going unpunished because a system is skewed against them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para4"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said that it was not a question of judicial amour propre. I entirely accept that. I have never suggested it, nor to my knowledge has any member of this Government. He said that there had been no other cases. I respectfully dissent from that view. There is abundant material to show that there have been many other cases; not cases which have gone to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, but cases of women who simply cannot bear the prospect of being cross-examined by their alleged criminal violator.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said that we must avoid the risk of miscarriages at all costs. I do not believe that he and I can agree on that. I do not believe that "at all costs" falls into the equation here. The trial process should not be about allowing witnesses, particularly in this specific class of case, to be abused by defendants who want to take the opportunity to cross-examine, badger, humiliate or intimidate the alleged victim. And it is a crime of violence. It is sexual, physical violence on the occasion of the attack; brutal humiliation and verbal violence in the court setting. They are not, qualitatively, enormously different in some ways. The slightest chance that that can happen in the future, no matter how controlled the questioning, is putting women off coming to court at all. They ask police officers, they ask the CPS, "Is it still a prospect?" and the honest police officer, trained in this class of work, and the honourable servant of the Crown Prosecution Service have to say that it is a possibility--because it is.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para6"></a>I do not consider that husbands should be given the chance to confront their wives in this way if they are accused of rape. I thought myself that a married woman <P>


<a name="column_1406"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1406</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was no longer her husband's chattel. We have already decided--I repeat because no question has been raised about this--that a father accused of incestuous sexual abuse by his daughter, is denied that opportunity. We did that on policy grounds, which I for one am perfectly happy to defend, defend and defend again.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para7"></a>Of course the witness's evidence must be tested and of course the defendant's unique knowledge of a witness can help to uncover a false complaint, but that can be done fairly; it can be done properly; it can be done in the defendant's interests by a legal representative, properly instructed, who will stick to the issues at trial and is going to be professionally bound by obligations which make judicial control of the trial efficient, expeditious and fair. The prohibition does not curtail the freedom of a defendant to choose what defence should be put forward, or what questions within the proper limits should be asked of a witness. It does stop him taking the opportunity of further humiliation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para8"></a>I was going to say just a word or two justifying my thumbprint on the front of the Bill which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, kindly pointed to, but it seems there is no question about that. The certificate, at least in the context of Clause 33, was properly given and I will not deal with the cases in the European dimension which the noble Lord has referred to.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para9"></a>May I take an illustration? At the moment, under the general common law rules, if a defendant defends himself and the judge gives him directions that he must not ask this or that or must desist from this line or not continue with that, the only power the judge has, should he refuse, is to put him down in the cell. The judge has no present power to appoint a court authorised representative--none at all--and therefore in the scheme of this Bill, we are giving additional protection in that context to a defendant who is otherwise not represented. Of course some defendants will be wholly unco-operative: they are at the moment in a vast number of cases. They know the game. They cannot make a statement from the dock as Mr. Stonehouse could but they can still make a concluding speech which is supposed to have some relationship to the evidence which was given. Of course the complainants can play the system as of their choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para10"></a>The judge trying the case is perfectly capable and competent, in my experience of the modern judiciary--I say that without presumption--of saying calmly to the jury, "The reason why this defendant cannot ask questions of this woman is because Parliament says he is not allowed to. That is the law of our country. He is not allowed to cross-examine children: that is the law of our country. Whatever you think of it, members of the jury, you and I are bound by it and you are bound to abide faithfully and loyally by your oath." There is no difficulty there if the judge tries the case properly, as they do.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para11"></a>I return to what the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice said: there has been no further problem, for the reasons outlined by the noble Baronesses, Lady Kirkwood and Lady Kennedy, as well as by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell. I profoundly disagree that there is a further problem, <P>


<a name="column_1407"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1407</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and that it continues with us. The guidance of the Lord Chief Justice in the two leading cases was of course extremely important in setting down what judges have to do and what judges can do to control the proceedings. There was the emphasis that judges should step in to stop irrelevant, repetitive or humiliating questions, and that in certain circumstances the defendant can be stopped from questioning altogether.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para12"></a>I simply say this. That was the law long before those two cases were tried; whether by way of obligation on a member of the Bar or an unrepresented defendant, that was the law. These cases did have enormous publicity. Yet women who are in the position of the students of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, are not going to be satisfied on the next occasion when he gives them the moral tutor's guidance, "Ah, all will be well with you because we have got two guideline decisions from the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division". I am sorry to say that life is not like that.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para13"></a>We have thought carefully about this. We tried to balance the two rights and the two possible great wrongs of which the noble Earl spoke. It has not been an easy decision for any of us. Many of those concerned in making the decision have a lot of experience in one way or another of practice in various courts. It was not something we rushed into; we thought about it very carefully. The more I have listened to the arguments this evening--arguments which spanned the whole spectrum of possible debate--I regret to say to some Members of the Committee, the more abundantly I am sure we have come to the right conclusion, which, in the nature of things, is a compromise; but it is a right, just and proper one.

<P>
<A NAME="90201-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I must express my profound disagreement with the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, when he queried the phrase used by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice that it was necessary to avoid miscarriage of justice at all costs. I consider that a single miscarriage of justice--as the history of the past few years has shown--carries a disproportionate weight and affects the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system of this country in a deep and significant way.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para14"></a>My noble friend Lord Lester, arguing from principle as he does, because there is in fact no decided case of the Court of Human Rights which supports his proposition, referred to the proportionate principle and sought to balance Article 6.3 against Articles 3 and 8; that is to say, the human rights of the defendant to defend himself against the rights of the complainant who brings forward the complaint. Similarly, my noble friend Lord Russell referred to the balance that has to be struck between competing principles.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para15"></a>However, neither of my noble friends put into the balance the right of a person not to be wrongly convicted. It is more than a right to defend himself that is in that side of the balance when one is considering this problem; there is also his right not to be wrongly convicted. In the other side of the balance, if the position is as the history of the past two years has shown--that <P>


<a name="column_1408"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column 1408</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>no complainant has been put through this ordeal--and if judges have been given full and proper instructions as to how to deal with this situation should it arise in the future, there is nothing of significance to set in the balance against the right of the defendant not to be wrongly convicted and his right to defend himself.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para16"></a>My noble friend Lord Russell drew attention to the fact that it is painful and difficult for a complainant to go through with her complaint; and so it is; I have no doubt about that--if the complaint is true. Indeed, if it is true, I would add that it requires determination and consistency for a complaint to go forward. But, if one is carrying out a balancing exercise, against that painful and difficult task one has to set the dire consequences to an individual if he is wrongly convicted. A rape case in which I was involved last year resulted in a 14-year sentence of imprisonment for the defendant. That is a considerable period of time for the loss of liberty, followed as it inevitably will be by further restrictions upon that defendant's freedom.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para17"></a>We cannot proceed to make the law as if every complaint were true and as if the complainant had been violated. That is not the case. False complaints of rape are made for a variety of reasons: sometimes due to quarrels over money, the children, another woman or jealousy. All sorts of reasons lead to false complaints being made. It should be borne in mind that the problems of bringing forward complaints and the difficulties to which reference has been made may deter false complaints as well as those which might be properly founded. There is a deterrence not simply for people who are making true complaints and who have the benefit of the force of truth behind them when they make such complaints; a deterrent factor also operates when a person makes a false complaint.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-32_para18"></a>The Minister said that there is no question but that a defendant can defend himself properly. I disagree. I can see that the possibilities of a miscarriage of justice are inherent in Clause 33. However, for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment, although I may return to it at a later stage.

<FONT SIZE=3>justice. Several Members of the Committee, on both sides of the debate, spoke from great experience of fears that the well intentioned provisions of Clause 33 contain potential danger to cause miscarriages of both types.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-33_para2"></a>I understand the concern of noble Lords, and in particular the difficulties that are faced by a police officer with a complainant who expresses concern about whether she is likely to be cross-examined by her attacker if she goes to court. I think that the Minister has temporarily forgotten that Clause 35 would enable the officer or person advising her to tell her that if the quality of her evidence was likely to be affected by her concern about such cross-examination, the prosecution could apply to the judge and a prohibition on that cross-examination could be made. The Bill contains other provisions which afford protection to those particularly vulnerable witnesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201-33_para3"></a>I regret to say that I do not believe that many of those who have been the subject of serious sexual attack will not still be deterred, even following the passage of this Bill.

Nevertheless, between now and Report stage, I hope that all those of us who listened to what has been said can reflect upon it.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Gilbert): </B>  Following the Strategic Defence Review, the Chief of Defence Logistics organisation was established, and the MoD is currently looking at possible locations for its headquarters. A number of sites in the UK are under consideration, including RAF Brampton/Wyton.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w01_para0"></a>Some tasks currently undertaken by Headquarters Logistics Command at RAF Wyton/Brampton will be absorbed by the new headquarters. Consequently, the future use of some parts of the Brampton/Wyton site would need to be reviewed, should the new headquarters be located elsewhere. There are a number of other logistics organisations based at RAF Wyton/Brampton which we are not planning to relocate.

<A NAME="90201w01_wqn1"></A><B> Baroness Goudie </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their response to the report and recommendations of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body.[HL795]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   The 1999 Report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body has been published today. Copies are available in the Printed Papers Office and the Library of the House. We are grateful to the Chairman and members of the Review Body for the work they have put into them.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w01_para1"></a>In the Comprehensive Spending Review, the Government made it clear that public sector pay settlements would need to be fair, affordable and consistent with targets for public service improvements we have set. The new arrangements announced in the CSR for the Pay Review Bodies were designed to ensure a closer and more effective link between pay settlements, departmental expenditure limits and service delivery targets. Under these new arrangements, the AFPRB now reports to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence, as responsible Departmental Minister, as well as to the Prime Minister. The Terms of Reference of the AFPRB were revised to ensure that, in making their recommendations, they took into account four key considerations set out in the CSR:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>the Government's inflation target, requiring responsibility in pay settlements across the public and private sectors.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90201w01_para6"></a>The AFPRB has recommended an increase in basic military salary of about 3.5 per cent. for all ranks, with the exception of: Privates and Lance Corporals, and their equivalents, who should receive 3.6 per cent.; Lieutenants and Captains, and their equivalents, who should receive 3.7 per cent.; and Brigadiers, and their equivalents, who should receive 3.3 per cent. Additional Pay--for example Flying Pay and Submarine Pay--will also increase by 3.3 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w01_para7"></a>We are satisfied that these recommendations take account of the four key considerations and will support the Services' strategies to achieve full manning. The additional cost of this settlement will be contained within the MoD's expenditure limits announced in July and we will continue to meet the objectives and targets set out in Public Service Agreements. This is in line with the Government's prudent and disciplined approach to public spending and its commitment to delivering high quality public services and low inflation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w01_para8"></a>The AFPRB's recommendations are to be accepted in full, with implementation effective from 1 April 1999.

<A NAME="90201w01_wqn3"></A><B> Viscount Simon </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What conclusions they have reached following their review of the law relating to the drinking of raw cow milk in England and Wales.[HL639]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My right honourable friends the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales have decided not to stop the sale of raw cow's drinking milk in England and Wales. However, they intend to introduce tighter checks to benefit consumers who choose to drink raw cows' milk.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w01_para9"></a>The new measures will include increasing the frequency of official microbiological sample testing of raw cow's drinking milk at production premises to four times a year and increasing the frequency of official
<P>


<a name="column_WA177"></a>

<B>1 Feb 1999 : Column WA177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inspections of registered raw cow's milk production holdings to once a year. These measures will begin immediately.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w01_para10"></a>Raw milk producers will continue to pay for official checks, and we will be putting in hand arrangements to extend the scope of enforcement at production holdings. In addition, we intend that on-farm caterers will no  longer be exempted from the charges for microbiological sample testing, and also that the full costs of inspection and sample testing will be recovered. This will necessitate changes to the relevant regulations, and in due course we will issue draft regulations for public consultation.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w01_para11"></a>There is already a requirement to label raw cow's drinking milk with a public health warning. We will be putting into place arrangements to ensure that this is  given greater prominence. In addition, these arrangements will also require that labels on retail packaging, and notices displayed at on-farm catering premises, must include the Chief Medical Officer's advice, which is that children, pregnant women, elderly people and those who are currently unwell or have chronic illness should not consume raw cow's milk.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w01_para12"></a>We emphasise in the strongest possible terms that the industry is responsible, and remains responsible, for the production of safe food. Producers of raw cow's drinking milk must ensure that it is produced to the best hygienic standards.

<P>
<UL>What are the policy priorities for the Biotechnology and Sciences Research Council; and which Minister authorises these.[HL575]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) is a non-departmental public body established by Royal Charter under the Science and Technology Act 1965 which takes its own decisions on policy, strategy, and what research to support, operating within a broad framework of guidance and supervision by government. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is accountable to Parliament for the activities of the council and determines the broad policy framework within which the council operates. He is supported by myself as Science Minister and the Director-General of Research Councils and the Office of Science and Technology (OST). Further details of the formal relationship are set out in the Management Statement and Financial Memorandum between the BBSRC and OST, a copy of which is available in the Library.
<P>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   The regulation of telecoms operators is a matter for Oftel. The Government and Oftel considered the importance of being able to trace nuisance calls carefully before the launch of the Calling Line Identification (CLI) service in 1994. The possibility of barring CLI (by dialling 141 before the number) was introduced for those people who do not wish to have their number released for legitimate reasons, which may relate to the protection of their privacy, and which may be personal. However, in order to protect customers against nuisance callers who withhold their CLI, the police do have the ability to trace nuisance calls, by formally requesting the details from the telecoms operator from whose network the calls were made.

<P>
<A NAME="90201w02_wqn1"></A><B> The Countess of Mar </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will issue clear and consistent instructions to cheese makers, veterinarians and environmental health officers in the whole of the United Kingdom as to the action which should be taken when it is found that cattle producing milk for cheese production are found to be (a) tuberculin test reactors or (b) show inconclusive results at testing.[HL654]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  The Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995 (Schedule 3) and the equivalent regulations in Northern Ireland and Scotland require that raw cow's milk shall come from animals belonging to a herd which is officially tuberculosis free (OTF).
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w02_para0"></a>Where dairy herds are tested by veterinarians and do not satisfy this condition, following the disclosure of tuberculin test reactors, then milk may only be sold for human consumption after it has been heat treated (Regulation 9(10) of the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations). Similar legislation and controls apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w02_para1"></a>When veterinarians carry out TB testing of dairy herds they will advise dairy farmers (including those making cheese) of reactors found in the herd and requirements to safeguard animal health. Where the OTF status of a dairy herd is suspended or withdrawn, whether by discovery of reactors or for any other reason, in the United Kingdom, the Veterinary Service will notify the relevant food authorities who have enforcement responsibility for the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations. The food authorities will also contact producers of raw milk products such as cheesemakers to give advice where they may have purchased raw cow's milk from herds where the OTF status has been suspended or withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w02_para2"></a>Currently, when inconclusive reactors only are disclosed, the official tuberculosis-free status of the herd is retained; the animals which reacted inconclusively are kept in isolation and retested. Amendments to European Union animal health legislation, due to be implemented by 1 July 1999, require herds with inconclusive reactors to have their OTF status suspended if there has been a confirmed TB incident within the past three years.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w02_para3"></a>The Department of Health are currently preparing guidance for food authorities in conjunction with other relevant government departments.

My honourable friend the Minister of State for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning set out a range of measures to achieve this in the Modernising Planning Statement he published on 15 January 1998. This included proposals to improve the arrangements for delivering local plans and unitary development plans; quicker handling of planning appeals; and improving local planning performance through Best Value. A number of other initiatives are under way, including a review of consultation procedures for planning applications; and a review of procedures for handling listed building consent applications.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The first two stages of the Quinquennial Review of the Prison Service have now been concluded and my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has today placed in the Library copies of the Evaluation of Performance and the Prior Options Report. A revised Framework Document is being finalised and will be published shortly.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w03_para0"></a>The Evaluation of Performance concludes that since becoming an agency, and during a period of rising prison population, the Prison Service has achieved a remarkable turnaround in performance, to which agency status has contributed for the following reasons:
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w03_para1"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>the delegated freedoms and flexibilities to the Director General;
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>a focus on agreed outputs and targets for which the Director General is personally responsible to my right honourable friend the Home Secretary;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90201w03_para3"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>a more cohesive organisation with a more visible Director General enables him to provide clearer leadership and to communicate with the organisation more effectively and to speak publicly for the Prison Service.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "90201w03_para4"></a>The Prior Options Report reviews agency and other organisational options for the Prison Service and concludes that continued agency status offers the most appropriate and cost effective means of achieving Home Office aims. It notes and endorses the major agenda of work already in progress or planned as a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review and the Prison Probation Review. It notes the need for further work in the next period of agency status on contractorisation issues, taking into account experience with tighter "contracts" between headquarters and individual prisons and the overall contribution of the private sector to prison services.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w03_para5"></a>In the light of these findings, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary accepts the recommendation of the Prior Options Report that agency status should be reconfirmed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w03_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What percentage of mentally disordered offenders are included in the current prison population of some 64,000.[HL642]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Mentally disordered offenders are found in a variety of settings. Some are in secure psychiatric hospitals, some are in Prison Service establishments and others, who have committed relatively minor offences and pose less risk to the public, remain in the community. Information about what proportion of the total number are in prison is not available. However, a survey of psychiatric morbidity among prisoners in England and Wales, undertaken in 1997 by the Office for National Statistics for the Department of Health, showed that around 90 per cent. of prisoners sampled displayed evidence of at least one of the five disorders (personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, alcohol misuse and drug dependence) considered in the survey.

<P>
<A NAME="90201w03_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What conclusions they draw from voluntary and compulsory drug tests carried out on prisoners in recent years.[HL643]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Mandatory drug tests proving positive fell from 24.4 per cent. in 1996-97 to 18.8 per cent. in the first seven months of 1998-99. This is an indication of the success of the Prison Service's drug strategy. Mandatory drug testing acts as a deterrent to drug misuse, provides information on trends in drug misuse, and enables the identification and referral of drug misusers to treatment programmes. The number of voluntary drug test samples sent for laboratory analysis has risen from 9,992 in 1996-97 to 14,759 in 1997-98 and 10,340 in the first seven months of 1998-99. Many more tests have been undertaken using on-site screening machines or test kits. This is a welcome sign of a growing commitment amongst prisoners to remain drug free.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by Lord Williams of Mostyn on 20 January (WA 105-106), whether they will ask chief constables to inform them whether child prostitution and the exploitation of children for pornography appear to be significant in their areas, given the importance of such information for the formulation of the National Plan concerning child abuse.[HL668]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   There are no plans at present to ask chief constables to inform the Government specifically whether child prostitution and the exploitation of children for pornography appear to be significant in their areas.

<FONT SIZE=3>Act 1998 requires police and local authorities to carry out audits of crime and disorder in their areas. Child prostitution and the exploitation of children for pornography should appear in the audits if they are significant local problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "90201w03_para6"></a>The National Plan we are developing will put the wide range of work the Government are undertaking to combat the commercial sexual exploitation of children within a coherent framework. The contents of the plan have yet to be agreed but it will include the action we are taking to combat the problems of child prostitution and child pornography. We will consult interested organisations about the contents of the plan in March.

<P>
<UL>Whether they will now remove the restriction in Prison Rule 16 that prisoners undergoing solitary confinement may only have in their possession such religious books as may be approved by the Secretary of State.[HL618]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="90201w03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My written reply of 7 July 1998 (Official Report, col. 125) explained that prisoners serving a punishment of cellular confinement are allowed all normal privileges (except for those incompatible with cellular confinement), unless a concurrent punishment of forfeiture of privileges has been imposed. Normal privileges include a reasonable number of personal possessions including access to a range of reading material. Where, exceptionally, reading material is withdrawn from a prisoner undergoing cellular confinement, the prisoners would nevertheless retain access to those religious books approved by the Secretary of State for use in prisons under Prison Rule 16. There are no current plans to alter the list under Prison Rule 16, but I am always ready to receive representations on the matter.

<A NAME = "90201w03_para7"></a>This figure is subject to minor fluctuation as new postings are agreed and others end. It does not include those who are posted to London in another primary capacity but who occasionally carry out functions similar to those of a police liaison officer, or Customs liaison officers.
