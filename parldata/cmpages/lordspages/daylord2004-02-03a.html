<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool </B>  : My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In doing so, I declare a non-financial interest as chairman of the All-Party British North Korea Parliamentary Group.
<P>

<a name="40203-01_para0"></a>The Question was as follows:
<P>

<a name="40203-01_para1"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of the security and human rights situation in North Korea.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, Her Majesty's Government fully support the six party talks process, which began in August 2003. The agreed objective of those talks is to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons, peacefully and through dialogue.
<P>

<a name="40203-01_para2"></a>On human rights, we are concerned about reports of continued, serious violations of human rights in North Korea. We raise these issues regularly in our dealings with the North Korean authorities in London and in Pyongyang.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply and welcome the strong approach that the Government have adopted. What assessment have they made of the BBC television documentary that was broadcast on Sunday evening, which documented examples of lethal chemical weapons tests against civilians? Does she agree that the best way forward in North Korea is to continue the process of engagement and dialogue, so that the dangerous nuclear stand-off and the serial human rights abuses can be consigned to the past?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I wish that we were able to engage on these serious allegations of human rights abuses. I saw part of the programme to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred and I&#151;like, I suggest, many others who saw that programme&#151;was completely appalled at the practices outlined in the documentary. I share the noble Lord's concerns about the cruel and inhuman treatment in those kinds of facilities.
<P>

<a name="40203-01_para3"></a>Yesterday, we made representations to the embassy in London as a result of that programme. The embassy denied that any such activities take place in North Korea. It refuted all the allegations made. We have requested a meeting next week with the ambassador on <P>


<a name="column_548"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 548</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wider issues of human rights. Although the North Koreans are finding it hard to engage with us, we shall persist.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, the Minister may be sceptical about the allegations of the development of chemical and biological weapons made in the programme, although less so when they come from the BBC than when they come from 10 Downing Street. The programme displayed an atmosphere of collective paranoia. Does she not agree that the people of North Korea seem to be convinced that they need these weapons of mass destruction to defend themselves against American aggression? Therefore, apart from the six nation talks at high level to try to remove nuclear weapons from the peninsula, does the Minister think that the western world should campaign to open up North Korea, so that the people can see for themselves that no one has aggressive intentions against them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I confess that I am slightly taken aback by what the noble Lord said. I am sure that he is not trying to play politics with questions of human rights. I do not know whether the noble Lord saw the programme. If half of what was alleged in the programme is true, I suggest to him that there can be no possible excuse for such experimentation involving whole families being herded into rooms and subjected to lethal conditions. It was disgusting and appalling to see.
<P>

<a name="40203-01_para4"></a>As to the threat to North Korea, the issues of its security are being addressed through the six party discussions. We learnt this morning that it is proposed that the talks will be resumed on 25 February. I hope that that is something that your Lordships will be pleased to hear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Cox: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister know the results of the recent visit by five American observers to Yongbyon nuclear facility in North Korea, with regard to the obvious security threat from its nuclear programme? Does she consider that it would be appropriate for a comparable British delegation to visit North Korea to discuss these serious human rights issues, which concern us all?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I understand that the visit provided no conclusive evidence about the state of North Korea's nuclear programmes. Such evidence could be provided only by a comprehensive inspection by international monitors, which would require the full co-operation of the DPRK authorities. It is an area on which we must do more work.
<P>

<a name="40203-01_para5"></a>As to the question of whether non-governmental groups could engage on human rights issues, the problem is that the Government of North Korea will not engage. I welcome interest taken by anybody who tries to get to the bottom of these issues. It is important that, despite the non-engagement, we do not let up on the dialogue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend confirm that the role of China in the human <P>


<a name="column_549"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 549</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rights situation is wholly deplorable? It arrests refugees from North Korea, and imprisons them or returns them to face torture or, possibly, death. It even imprisons international humanitarian workers. Can it be made clear to China that if, as appears, it wants to earn the respect the international community, it must work at it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, we expect all countries with whom we engage to respect human rights. Regrettable as some of the practices are in a number of different countries around the world, in respect of China at the moment we very much rely on its engagement in the six party talks. It is a very difficult situation. The fact is that until we can engage properly on a nuclear issue, we are very unlikely to make real progress on human rights issues. That, of necessity, is where we start with the nuclear issue but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, reminded us, we must not lose sight of the deplorable state of human rights in North Korea.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister give some thought as to the possibility of using the mechanisms of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which has rapporteurs for dealing with these kinds of allegations, as a way of starting a dialogue with the North Koreans which might be a little more difficult to fend off than just bilateral approaches?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, we supported the 2003 UN Commission on Human Rights resolution that calls for access to the country by independent monitors and for engagement by North Korea with the UN human rights mechanisms. That is something that we very warmly support. We want to pursue a dialogue with North Korea on human rights as I have indicated, including with its national commission on human rights. However, I must re-emphasise to your Lordships that this is not for want of trying. The fact is that North Korea simply refuses to engage. We shall continue to raise all our concerns and we shall also raise those concerns when the Supreme People's Assembly delegation visits the United Kingdom between 15 and 18 March this year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness recall saying last November that the Government's judgment is that North Korea has the fissile material with which to make one or two nuclear weapons, has the technical ability to make them and can also make missiles that will travel 10,000 miles? Am I alone in finding it rather surprising that in this situation the United States is taking rather a leisurely attitude towards the problem? If I am right, what is the explanation for that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that the United States is taking a leisurely attitude. The fact is that the North Koreans have so far publicly acknowledged one plutonium-based programme. They admitted in discussions with United <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>States officials in October 2002 that they had also pursued a clandestine uranium enrichment programme. The international community is seeking to resolve this issue through the six party discussions. Those six parties include not only the United States and North Korea but also South Korea, Japan, China and Russia. The first round of talks that began in August last year sadly did not get very far but the second round of talks is due to begin towards the end of this month. This will be a very long process, but it is one in which the North Koreans are proposing to be engaged.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will explain the role of the Office of Fair Trading in the rail franchising process.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the award of a rail franchise constitutes an acquisition of control by virtue of Section 66(3) of the Railways Act 1993 as amended, for the purposes of the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002. The Office of Fair Trading has a duty under the Enterprise Act to refer certain mergers to the Competition Commission if it believes that the arrangements in question have resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for that reply but, with regard to the rail franchise in Scotland, does he share my concern that the competition authorities left it until very late in the franchising process before deciding that there might in principle be a conflict regarding the same company operating the bus and the rail franchise? Does not the noble Lord agree that clarification in that area needs to be sought urgently to bring a little more stability into what is already a very difficult industry?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Baroness that we want to see movement on this decision as expeditiously as possible. However, she will recognise that it is not a matter for Ministers but for the properly constituted authorities which will note the point that she has made so volubly today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, how does the Minister's last answer sit with the Government's intention to promote co-ordinated transport? If transport operators are not allowed to co-operate with each other on services, fares and co-ordination of bus and rail, what does their policy amount to?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has highlighted an important principle of the Government's transport policy. We want to see greater integration of such activities. However, that does not mean that we necessarily want to see one company <P>


<a name="column_551"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 551</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>running all rail and bus services in an area as that would lead to obvious dangers so far as the fare-paying and travelling public are concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, in relation to the supplementary question of the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, did I understand her to suggest that the people who run the railway line are in competition with the people who run the trains? The idea in Scotland is that they should work together. I do not see that there is any objection to that. Do the Government agree with me on that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that is the issue regarding competition. A potential situation has been identified in which a company with substantial bus interests would take over the Scot Rail franchise. That is the nub of the problem. The relationship between the companies that own the rolling stock and the trains and Network Rail, which owns the rail track, is a different matter altogether.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, how many organisations are involved in controlling and regulating the rail industry?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, there are several and the co-ordination is not all that we should like, which is why the Secretary of State has indicated that he wants a review carried out over the next five months. By June we should be in a position to produce a rationalised system of regulation and control for the railways.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, is not the most relevant form of competition that between public transport and the private motor car? Should not the OFT be focussing on that rather than the rail passenger franchising process?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the OFT has a limited role which relates to competition between companies. I do not believe that the noble Lord is indicating that particular companies present problems relating to car traffic, however large they may be regarding hire cars and so on. So that issue is not quite four-square with this issue, which is about a bus company and a rail franchise.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  My Lords, Her Majesty's Government believe that international co-operation to promote transparency and exchange of information is <P>


<a name="column_552"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 552</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the most effective way of tackling cross-border tax evasion. We welcome the progress that our overseas territories and the Crown Dependencies have made in committing to international standards and we will continue to promote the adoption of the highest standards in all financial centres.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. However, is he aware that there are perfectly reputable accountants who set up tax avoidance schemes which are then abused by taxpayers and used for evasion purposes? The Minister mentioned the question of co-operation. Can he confirm that the OECD is trying to ensure that there is a rule drawn up for all countries where there are tax havens? Without such a ruling, no single country would agree to co-operate with the OECD. I understand that a number of countries are not co-operating. What exactly is the UK Government doing about that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, regarding the first question of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, I would have thought that one of the professional responsibilities of perfectly reputable accountants would be to see that their clients do not use their advice for tax evasion.
<P>

<a name="40203-02_para0"></a>Regarding his second question, I agree that it is necessary for us to support the OECD's pursuit of all financial centres to ensure that they adopt the highest possible standards. Most recently we have succeeded in ensuring the highest possible standards in the Crown Dependencies. The issue of overseas territories is being pursued by the European Union with a good deal of success, but we need to continue to pursue many other financial centres. We totally support the OECD in doing that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, what estimate do the Government make of the tax loss each year from tax evasion through offshore financial centres? Will he say how much that has been reduced by government policies over the past seven years?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that might be the classic unknowable statistic. Tax evasion is tax that is unpaid by breaking the law. If we had statistics on law breaking we could stop that. By definition, estimates of tax avoidance may exist, but that was not the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. Yes, we are making progress, but it is inevitably slow. First, it has been through the EU savings directive; and all but three countries in the EU now agree to exchange of information, which is our preferred method. Those countries&#151;namely, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria&#151;which still maintain withholding taxes, will have to increase them. All of that puts pressure on the next group of countries, including, most importantly, Switzerland; and that, in turn, puts pressure on those outside countries which are also resisting. It is a long and difficult task, but as we make step-by-step progress it becomes more difficult to use offshore tax havens.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, does the existence of tax havens mean that what the rest of us would regard as "tax evasion" is described as "tax avoidance"? I thought that was the point of my noble friend's Question. Is it not the case that whereas ordinary British people work extremely hard and end up paying the maximum rate of tax, other people earn infinitely more and end up paying lower rates of tax? Do not the Government&#151;not just accountants&#151;have a responsibility to act as vigorously as they can to deal with that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I thought that I answered a question like that in some detail a couple of weeks ago in the House. I agree that it is in all our interests that we should pursue tax avoidance and tax evasion. Lower rates of tax in themselves cannot be pursued. We are not looking for harmonisation of either corporation tax or income tax. But through the European Union and OECD we pursue the use of those lower tax rates by offshore financial centres to facilitate tax avoidance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, why should the Minister seek to make a moral argument that says that the Inland Revenue can use all of its powers and legal advice to obtain the maximum amount of tax from the taxpayer, while the taxpayer is criticised for doing no more than seeking the best advice that he can afford to ensure that he pays the minimum amount within the law? That is spoiling a perfectly happy relationship between those people and the Inland Revenue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have already made clear that we cannot pursue differential rates of taxation in different centres. It is when those rates are used to avoid taxes due to this country that we are obligated to pursue the matter&#151;in that I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Peston. That is why we have supported the savings directive and, particularly, its disclosure provisions, which will help to ensure that people pay tax in the tax regime where they are supposed to pay it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Marsh, displays an untypical streak of naivety in his comments regarding tax evasion. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett&#151;

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, those of us who have practised in the field, whether as accountants or solicitors, might be a little more sceptical.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew1"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Question!
<P>


<a name="column_554"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 554</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, my question relates to the report of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee on tackling tax fraud, which was published three weeks' ago. It pointed out that the Inland Revenue would like to have the same power as the United States Internal Revenue Service to issue information notices to banks, asking them if a customer has an overseas account. Would the Government contemplate giving our Inland Revenue the same powers, because they would be effective?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I shall not comment on the first point made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips&#151;called by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, "the fine line" between tax evasion and tax avoidance. For me one is illegal and the other is legal and that is not a fine line at all.
<P>

<a name="40203-03_para0"></a>Regarding the second point, I acknowledge the valuable report of the Public Accounts Committee. In turn, it recognised that in the 2003 Budget we introduced new compliance and enforcement initiatives to enable us to deal with offshore problems. The committee agreed that any further steps should await confirmation of the success or otherwise of the initiatives that were introduced last year. We are certainly prepared to go further if that proves necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted that my noble friend recognises the fine line between tax avoidance and tax evasion occasionally. However, in his earlier reply he appeared to place responsibility on perfectly reputable accountants who have devised perfectly legal tax avoidance schemes that are misused by taxpayers. That is what I was referring to and I hope that that was what he had in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the phrase "fine line" was used by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. I see no fine line between illegality and legality. It is different under different legal jurisdictions, but it is there and it ought to be adhered to.
<P>

<a name="40203-03_para1"></a>My point in relation to the first supplementary question was that professional advisers, be they lawyers or accountants, have a responsibility to ensure that clients who take their advice do not transgress the line between avoidance and evasion. If he is saying that others who have no professional relationship to a client are doing that, clearly professional advisers cannot intervene.

<A NAME="40203-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, in the light of the outbreak of avian flu, European law was introduced on 29 January addressing concerns about live birds. Accordingly, the UK Government took measures that same day to ban the importation of all live birds from Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, China, South Korea and Vietnam.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. I am surprised that the Government, in choosing to ban a number of imported products on 23 January, did not ban the import of live birds until a week later. In the light of lessons learnt during the foot and mouth outbreak about transmission between live animals or birds being so much more dangerous, can the Minister explain that? Furthermore, is this not a good moment to call a halt to a trade which is a disguise for some of the illegal imports of wild birds into this country, decimating the populations in the countries from which they come?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, there are two different points. The EU decision to ban the import of live birds of all kinds from the nine south-east Asian countries was a precautionary move and further precautionary moves have been introduced. The risk of them having the strain of avian flu that exists among poultry is very low. The number of imports of live birds from those countries directly into the UK during the past few years has been very low indeed.
<P>

<a name="40203-03_para2"></a>In so far as live exotic birds are imported from tropical climes, they tend to come from South Africa and not from south-east Asia. While there have been concerns about legitimacy and bird welfare involved in the trade, it is a legal trade under EU and international law, provided that animal welfare legislation is observed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, are chicken droppings made into fertiliser and then exported from the Far East? If so, should not that trade be halted?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, fertiliser made in that way should not be imported from the Far East but, on a precautionary basis, the EU is banning imports of feathers and a number of products based on bird droppings from those countries. That therefore minimises any risk, however remote, of the particular strain of avian flu coming into Europe.

<A NAME="40203-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </B>   My Lords, we should be glad that the Government have banned the import of live birds. There is of course the major problem of poultry products coming from the Far East in massive amounts. This virus spreads rapidly and is lethal. What is the capability of this country and the European Union in the production of a vaccine against this avian flu and possibly the recombination of avian and human flu viruses? Are we set up to respond to the danger should it enter the EU?

<FONT SIZE=3>involved after 1 January. Processed meat will have gone through a heat process that will have eliminated the virus. Indeed, the virus probably disappears from meat, although not necessarily from chilled and frozen meat.
<P>

<a name="40203-03_para3"></a>As regards the vaccine, the World Health Organisation network is working on vaccines which meet particular strains of avian flu. The vaccine is not at this point available and it may take weeks or months before it would be available on a sufficiently usable scale in Europe. If there were a recombination of the kind the noble Lord refers to in humans, that would be a different strain again on which one would have to develop a vaccine. A base vaccine exists, but one would have to develop it in order to meet the particular strain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, do the Minister and the Government share the concerns I have heard expressed by some biologists that avian flu would be more likely to spread to pigs than humans and that if it did a new virus could be generated which would be far more infective between humans because the pig is much nearer to our construction than is the bird?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, it is true that pigs are susceptible to avian flu. In the same way as a reconstitution of the virus can occur in humans, in effect creating a new virus, it can do so in pigs for the very reason the noble Baroness outlined. Therefore, there is undoubtedly that danger, which is probably higher because frequently in south-east Asia&#151;in China in particular&#151;pigs and poultry are kept together. That form of husbandry may maximise the danger, which is why Europe and other importing areas of the world must be on their guard against importing any poultry or pig produce from the affected areas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm whether or not wild birds are able to contract avian flu? When the question was first raised a few weeks ago, he said that it was not possible. Secondly, although the embargo was slapped on as soon as it was known, the outbreak occurred in October/November. Is there any tracking of cage-birds that have entered the country? If so, what results have been shown?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, extremely few cage-birds have entered this country from south-east Asia in recent years and therefore a tracking system could not effectively be pursued. In any event, the virus would have run out by October. As I said last week, there is a low level of avian flu in wild bird populations. It tends to be of low pathogenecity and in poultry the pathogenicity increases. Therefore, the transferability of avian flu in wild birds to humans is probably very limited indeed, if it exists at all. It must be transmitted via poultry before it becomes infective to humans. Nevertheless, that situation must be kept under control.
<P>

<a name="40203-03_para4"></a>As for the outbreak in October, we had continuous reports until 23 January that the Thai outbreak was not avian flu. The position in relation to the other <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>countries was that for other reasons poultry from all of them has been banned for some considerable time and the situation would not arise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   My Lords, have there been any seizures of chicken produce from Asia since the ban came into being? If so, have there been any prosecutions of the people who have brought in that produce?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, since the ban on imports from Thailand, which is the only new ban, there have been no seizures. There may well have been seizures prior to the avian flu of produce coming from China and other banned countries. If I can acquire such information, I will let the noble Lord know.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they have ceased permitting the erection of onshore wind farms in the light of recent evidence of their effect on human health.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, we have no plans to change current procedures for giving consent to onshore wind farms. Currently planning authorities take into account the recommendations and methodologies for the measurement of noise in the case of wind farms as set out in the report ETSU-R-97: The Assessment & Rating of Noise from Wind Farms.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para0"></a>The methodologies applied during the planning application stage to satisfy authorities that noise emission levels will fall within accepted levels do not include the measurement of infrasound, as we are not aware of any scientifically validated evidence that infrasound emitted from wind turbines affects human health.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, the Minister will undoubtedly be aware that the Danes have ceased the erection of further on shore wind farms, in part as a consequence of health concerns. I hope he will also be aware that his colleagues in Defra have commissioned an investigation into the effects on health of infrasound; that is, low-frequency sound. Does that not suggest at the very least that the Government should consider a moratorium on further construction until the matter is properly cleared up?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I have no reason to suppose that the Danes have started to build more offshore wind turbines because of health reasons. They have done so for the good reason that offshore wind turbines can be larger, which is more economical. Denmark already has a density of wind turbines 30 times greater than this country.
<P>


<a name="column_558"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 558</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para1"></a>Defra is carrying out a further study on the effect of low-frequency noise on health, but it is not related to wind farms. The study by Dr Harry, which suggested that low-frequency noise from wind farms could have an effect on human health, is contradicted by the study carried out in 1997, which showed that vibrations from wind farms have no impact on low-frequency vibration levels at the distances we are talking of.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Watson of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, in the light of well documented research on the damage that offshore and coastal wind farms have done to bird life in Spain, the greatest care will have to be taken on the location of wind farms? Will he assure that House that the matter is subject to active research by the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, clearly this issue is of great importance and we are very aware of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Tanlaw: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister say why the Ministry of Defence still objects to the erection of windmills in south-west Scotland on the basis that they interfere with radar? I understand that the only interference they make is similar to that of a heavy rainstorm or a clump of trees. I do not think that that justifies such objections.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, this matter is being considered by the Ministry of Defence. As far as I know, no health issues are involved&#151;which is what the Question is about&#151;but if they have an impact, obviously we need to take it seriously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, given the controversial nature of wind farms, will the Minister consider that the time might be right to expend more effort and finance on tidal power, which is a guaranteed source of energy for 20 hours out of every 24, 365 days of the year? If it was applied through tidal lagoons it would cause no problems to marine or avian life and could be as beneficial as wind power.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, tidal power is extremely expensive at this stage compared to wind turbines. Wind turbines are by far the most economical option. There is no kind of energy generation that does not have some downside. The question is therefore to balance the risks, the costs and the energy security objectives. The health downsides of wind turbines, as I hope I pointed out, are non-existent at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the psychological health of the nation is deeply related to the quality of our countryside, which is becoming at a premium? Will he assure the House that in future policy towards wind farms&#151;which have an <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, it is a major part of the planning process that the important consideration of the impact on the environment is taken care of.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, what does the Minister believe to be the safe separation between dwellings and wind turbines in terms of low-frequency considerations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the latest figure in the planning guidelines is 300 to 400 metres. Some bodies producing wind power such as National Wind Power use a more stringent guideline of 600 metres, which is probably desirable, but not necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary. The Statement was as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="40203-04_para3"></a>"Mr Speaker, with permission, I should like to make a Statement. The Prime Minister has decided to establish a committee to review intelligence on weapons of mass destruction. This committee will be composed of privy counsellors. It will have the following terms of reference: to investigate the intelligence coverage available on WMD programmes of countries of concern and on the global trade in WMD, taking into account what is now known about these programmes; as part of this work, to investigate the accuracy of the intelligence on Iraqi WMD up to March 2003, and to examine any discrepancies between the intelligence gathered, evaluated and used by the Government before the conflict, and between that intelligence and what has been discovered by the Iraq Survey Group since the end of the conflict; and to make recommendations to the Prime Minister for the future on the gathering, evaluation and use of intelligence on WMD, in the light of the difficulties of operating in countries of concern.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para4"></a>"The Prime Minister has asked the committee to report before the Summer Recess. The committee will follow the precedent in terms of procedures of the Franks committee, will have access to all intelligence reports and assessments and other relevant government papers and will be able to call witnesses to give oral evidence in private.
<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_560"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 560</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para5"></a>"The committee will work closely with the United States inquiry and the Iraq Survey Group. The committee will submit its final conclusions to the Prime Minister in a form for publication, along with any classified recommendations and material. The Government will, of course, co-operate fully with the committee.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para6"></a>"The members of the committee will be the Lord Butler of Brockwell, the chairman, Sir John Chilcot, Field Marshal Lord Inge and two senior Members of this House, the right honourable Member for Dewsbury and the honourable Member for East Hampshire, who will be made a privy counsellor.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para7"></a>"In setting the terms of the inquiry and its membership there have of course been discussions with the leaders of the two main opposition parties. I regret, however, that the leader of the Liberal Democrat Party has declined to support the inquiry; that, and that alone, explains the absence of a senior member of the Liberal Democrats on it.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para8"></a>"As the House will be well aware, there have already been three inquiries into aspects of the Iraq war. The first, established in early May last year, was by the Intelligence and Security Committee. This considered in some detail the intelligence received in London, its assessment, and use, including in the dossier. It reported to Parliament on 9 September.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para9"></a>"The second, by the Foreign Affairs Committee, was established on 3 June last year against the background of the controversy surrounding the Andrew Gilligan report on the "Today" programme on 29 May. It reported on 7 July.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para10"></a>"The third, the judicial inquiry by Lord Hutton, was established following the death of Dr David Kelly, and it of course reported last Wednesday.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para11"></a>"Although the terms of reference of the three inquiries varied, a central theme of each of them was whether the Government had acted improperly or dishonestly in using the intelligence available to them. Echoing the conclusions of the earlier reports, and in categorical terms, Lord Hutton made emphatic last week that such allegations were unfounded. This new inquiry will obviously not be revisiting the issues so comprehensively covered by Lord Hutton.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para12"></a>"Whilst these inquiries were under way, three proposals were put before the House in June, July and late October on opposition Motions calling for wider inquiries into aspects of the Government's handling of events in the run-up to the Iraq war. The Government resisted these calls, including on the grounds that the inquiries already under way should be allowed to complete their work. Later, both the Prime Minister and I referred also to the continuing activity of the Iraq Survey Group.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para13"></a>"Over the past week, we have seen the publication of the Hutton report and the evidence of Dr David Kay, former head of the Iraq Survey Group, to a US congressional committee. It has also emerged that the ISG may take longer to report than we had originally <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_561"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 561</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>envisaged. All this has led the Government now to judge that it is appropriate to establish this new inquiry of Privy Counsellors.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para14"></a>"Lord Hutton has, as I have said, dealt conclusively with the very grave charge against the Government that we had in some way acted improperly or dishonestly in the preparation of intelligence put before the House and the public.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para15"></a>"But the Government recognise that there are wider and entirely legitimate concerns about the reliability of the original intelligence, which have been heightened by Dr Kay's evidence. Dr Kay, repeatedly in that evidence, emphasised his continued support for the decision to take military action and that Iraq was in clear and material violation of UNSCR 1441. But he also said to Congress on 28 January:
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2> 'Prior to the war, my view was that the best evidence that I had seen was that Iraq, indeed, had weapons of mass destruction. I would also point out that many governments that chose not to support this war&#151;certainly the French President Chirac . . .  referred to Iraq's possession of WMD. The German intelligence certainly believed that there was WMD'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-04_para16"></a>
Dr Kay added:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> 'It turns out that we were all wrong, probably in my judgement, and that is most disturbing'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-04_para17"></a><P>
<UL>
<a name="40203-04_para18"></a>"In the intervening period since the Iraq war began, there have, however, been events elsewhere which have greatly increased anxieties about the proliferation of WMD and of the need for reliable intelligence and effective international action. According to reports over the weekend, an individual has sold nuclear secrets to Pakistan. Iran, for a long time, did not report all that it should have reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency under its Safeguards Agreement. Libya was in breach of its obligations under the non-proliferation treaty and both countries are now the subject of considerable activity by the International Atomic Energy Agency. There are other concerns, too. So we have judged it prudent for this inquiry to consider these wider issues as set out in its terms of reference. But, of course, a great focus of the committee's work will be on Iraq, and rightly so.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para19"></a>"It is, however, important to remind ourselves both about the significance and the limits of the use of intelligence in relation to Iraq. The September dossier made a powerful case for the world to take notice of Iraq; it did not make a case for military action. And, as the record shows, the case for military action was fundamentally based upon Iraq's breach of UNSCR 1441.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para20"></a>"Saddam Hussein had used WMD against his own people and against his neighbour, Iran. He had invaded two of Iraq's neighbours, leading to the deaths of a million people. For 12 years after the Iraqi army was expelled from Kuwait, Saddam Hussein defied repeated United Nations resolutions calling for him to co-operate with UN weapons inspectors to dismantle his WMD programmes. Resolution 1441 unanimously found Iraq in material breach of previous resolutions and offered <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_562"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 562</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>it a 'final opportunity' to comply fully and immediately with UN inspectors or face 'serious consequences'. The head of the UN inspectors, Hans Blix, published on 7 March 2003 a 173-page document listing the unresolved issues in respect of Iraq's WMD programmes&#151;a document which I placed before the House in a command paper some days later.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para21"></a>"All this painted a compelling picture. As the Prime Minister and I have said repeatedly, it would have been gravely irresponsible not to have acted against this. We took the right decision in agreeing military action against Iraq, and it is still the right decision today.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para22"></a>"For the sake of completeness, it may be helpful to give a more rounded picture of Dr Kay's evidence to Congress last week. These are some of the things that he said:
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2> 'I think, when we have a complete record, you are going to discover that after 1998 Iraq became a regime that was totally corrupt. Individuals were out for their own protection and, in a world where we know others are seeking WMD, the likelihood at some point in the future of a seller and a buyer meeting up would have made that a far more dangerous country than even we anticipated with what may turn out to be a not fully accurate estimate.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-04_para23"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> 'All I can say is if you read the total body of intelligence in the last 12 to 15 years that flowed on Iraq, I quite frankly think it would be hard to come to a conclusion other than Iraq was a gathering, serious threat to the world with regard to WMD.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-04_para24"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> 'I think you will have, when you get the final ISG report, pretty compelling evidence that Saddam had the intention of continuing the pursuit of WMD when the opportunity arose'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-04_para25"></a>
I shall place in the Library of the House a full copy of Dr Kay's evidence.
<P>
<UL>
<a name="40203-04_para26"></a>"Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to the outstanding work of Britain's intelligence agencies around the world, often in hostile conditions. This inquiry is emphatically not an attack on that vital work, nor on the dedication and the professionalism of the people who work in those agencies. But what it should do is help the Government better to evaluate and assess the information they provide.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para27"></a>"The decision which this House took 10 months ago to go to war was justified, given the defiance of a regime which uniquely had used WMD and had refused to comply with obligations unanimously imposed upon it by the United Nations Security Council.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para28"></a>"That is a decision for which we, as elected representatives, took responsibility and will continue to take responsibility. We cannot sub-contract that to any inquiry, however distinguished. But I believe that Lord Butler and his colleagues will be able to perform a most valuable service to this House and the country, and I express my appreciation to them".
<P>
</UL>
<a name="40203-04_para29"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that we are all extremely grateful to the Minister for repeating this Statement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. Obviously, we welcome the <P>


<a name="column_563"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 563</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decision to hold this inquiry and, in particular, we welcome the appointment of the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, as its chairman and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, as a member of the inquiry team.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para30"></a>It is very much in the interests not only of the Government but also of the Opposition&#151;indeed, of all those who seek to participate responsibly in public affairs and the democratic process&#151;that trust and confidence in government institutions should be restored, including in our intelligence services.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para31"></a>In this terrorist age, when failure to anticipate attacks can be fatal and when the alternative to intelligent and well informed pre-emption of threats is defeat and possible mass murder, the quality and integrity of intelligence becomes even more crucial&#151;indeed, fundamental. So it is all the more vital to establish beyond doubt in people's minds what were the real reasons and justifications for removing Saddam Hussein and his hideous regime. As the Prime Minister emphasised and this Statement confirms, the inquiry now proposed will not go over the narrow ground covered by the Hutton inquiry. Personally, I have never doubted that the Prime Minister is entirely honourable. I am very glad that he escapes all criticism and that Downing Street is cleared of "underhand or duplicitous strategy", to quote the Hutton report, in the tragedy. Anyway, we shall debate that tomorrow.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para32"></a>But our concern has all along been something wider. While we thought, and still think on these Benches, that there were good grounds for getting rid swiftly of the monstrous Saddam regime, which incidentally, Dr Kay himself concluded did pose a serious and imminent threat despite no weapons of mass destruction being uncovered, we did repeatedly question at the time the main reasons being given by Ministers for going to war as part of the coalition. That is why we have been calling for a deeper inquiry for many months past; in fact, since last June.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para33"></a>I have some brief questions for the Minister. First, how is it that, despite our pleas over many months past, the Government have only now changed their mind and that very suddenly indeed? Only last Sunday the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, on whose guidance we so often in this House respectfully rely, was saying:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Little would be achieved by continually looking and re-looking at what the intelligence shows at a particular time".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-04_para34"></a>
Yet by Monday evening it seems that a lot would be achieved. This is a sudden and rapid U-turn without any signals, even by the erratic driving standards of the present administration.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para35"></a>Secondly, the terms of reference, to which I attach great importance, refer to the "evaluation" of intelligence gathered. Does that mean evaluation by intelligence officials themselves of the material they receive or does it mean evaluation by government of what they have received? The text appears to support the latter and surely it is bound to be the latter. In that case the role of government officials in handling and presenting intelligence will properly come in for scrutiny in this inquiry. I am not too clear why our <P>


<a name="column_564"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 564</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Liberal Democrat friends are so convinced it will not and why they have refused, rather regrettably in my view, to take part. But we shall doubtless learn about that in a moment.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para36"></a>Thirdly, while the terms of reference focus on WMDs, or rather the lack of them, how far will the investigation look at other areas of poor planning arising from poor intelligence? Obviously, that seems relevant to the overall performance of the intelligence services. For instance, it was widely predicted, presumably based on intelligence, that after the invasion of Iraq there would be massive refugee problems there, mass starvation and vast spread of disease. In fact, none of this happened. But as a result of those predictions based on intelligence, resources were deployed in the wrong form, at the wrong time and in the wrong direction, with very severe consequences from which the coalition efforts are only now recovering.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para37"></a>Fourthly, will this inquiry look closely at the role of the Joint Intelligence Committee and its relationship with Downing Street officials, which many people felt, and still feel, was too matey.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para38"></a>Fifthly, could we know more on timing and procedure? I understand that it will be a private inquiry, but that, as with Franks, all the evidence that is not highly classified will be fully published in due course. Is that correct? Will it be completed in 18 months like the American inquiry which, by an amazing coincidence, was also announced over the weekend, indeed yesterday?
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para39"></a>However, the main thing is that an inquiry which was deemed previously "not useful" by the Government is now held to be useful and necessary after all. So we on this side should be thankful that the Government have now changed their mind and agree with us, and thankful for this Damascene conversion on the road to clarity and public reassurance.

<A NAME="40203-04_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place and make the comment that, paraphrasing a former Prime Minister, a day appears to be a very long time in politics. I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, has said. Only as long ago as yesterday the Government, in the shape of the noble and learned Lord, were repeating the lack of necessity for an inquiry.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para40"></a>So the first question I ask the Government is this: exactly what happened between Sunday and Tuesday that changed the Government's mind? It was clearly not Dr Kay's evidence, which was given as long ago as last Wednesday and was not followed by any similar statement by the Government.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para41"></a>Secondly, on what basis did the Government take us to war? In that context I quote the answer given by the Prime Minister to a question asked by my right honourable friend in another place, Alan Beith, as long ago as the last meeting of the Liaison Committee on 8 July 2003. In answer to Mr Alan Beith's question <P>


<a name="column_565"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 565</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about what steps might be taken and what were the reasons for the Government's invasion of Iraq, Mr Blair replied:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The truth is that to take action we had to have the proper legal basis and that was through the weapons of mass destruction issue and the non-compliance with the UN inspectors".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-04_para42"></a>
The Prime Minister could not have stated more clearly the basis, as he saw it, of the decision to make war on Iraq.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para43"></a>The question which arises in this context is why, when we were assured by Mr Hans Blix last March that he needed only a few months to complete his work on the disarming of Iraq, nevertheless the Government, together with their American ally, decided to make war on that country?
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para44"></a>The third question concerns an issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, and echoed by the Minister herself. That is the absolute importance of the credibility and reliability of intelligence. There is no doubt that in a world of terrorism, rogue states and pre-emptive policies intelligence must be as credible and reliable as it can be. Given the remit of the inquiry, there is a danger that the intelligence services may become the scapegoats. I quote the former head of the Joint Intelligence Committee, who said on "The World at One" on Sunday that the inquiry,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"could become a device for making scapegoats of the intelligence people and diverting the primary responsibility from politicians".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-04_para45"></a>
Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have an interest in that happening.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para46"></a>I come finally to respond to the question legitimately put by the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, which is why the Liberal Democrats feel unable to participate in this inquiry. It comes straight back to the remit&#151;the terms of reference. In a letter to the Prime Minister dated yesterday, 2 February, the leader of my party in another place asked whether the subsequent presentation of intelligence could be taken within the remit of the inquiry and whether,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the political judgments based on that intelligence which led us to go to war in Iraq",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-04_para47"></a>
could be included within that inquiry.
Both were refused. I am surprised that the leader of the Conservative Party did not throw his weight behind widening the remit of the inquiry in that way which I believe would have made it difficult for the Government to refuse. But it was refused and we believe that, by placing the remit where it is, by above all excluding the political judgments about going to war from the terms of that remit, the Government are once again risking a loss of public trust. Without public trust, which must include the question of the judgment of politicians, we believe that from the very beginning this inquiry is jeopardised and will not bring to an end the serious questions asked about the United Kingdom's involvement in the war against Iraq.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I thank both noble Lords for welcoming, if not the contents of the Statement, the fact that I repeated it. <P>


<a name="column_566"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 566</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Like the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, I also welcome the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Butler, will be chairing this inquiry and that the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, who is well known in this House, will be a member of it.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para48"></a>I agree with the noble Lord; it is now very much in our interest that any vestige of mistrust or lack of confidence in the intelligence and the way it was gathered, evaluated and used by the Government before the conflict, is now laid to rest. This inquiry is a means of attempting to do so.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para49"></a>I also agree with the noble Lord about the importance of confidence in the evaluation and gathering of our intelligence. It is not just a question about WMD, although this inquiry is about WMD. Questions are of course raised, as the noble Lord pointed out, in relation to terrorism, but he and other noble Lords will have noticed that this inquiry is about the gathering of intelligence in relation to WMD.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para50"></a>The inquiry will not go over the Hutton points any further. The Hutton points have been exhausted in one of the most public exposures of the workings of the intelligence agencies that I can recall, in terms of what was put in the public domain. I thank the noble Lord for what he said about my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and Downing Street. I am glad that he was pleased that they were exonerated in the way that they have been. Similar views have been expressed from many sides of this House&#151;not just on my own Benches but from Benches right around your Lordships' House, and I welcome that.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para51"></a>The noble Lord said that the concerns went wider than the Hutton remit and that they repeatedly questioned, during the run-up to the war, the basis for going to war with Iraq; I believe that he referred to wanting to get rid of Saddam Hussein. On most occasions when we discussed this, if not every occasion, I reiterated to your Lordships that the basis for our going into a war was the flouting of the United Nations resolution over a very long period. I am sure your Lordships will recall the unanimous passing of UNSCR 1441&#151;my right honourable friend referred to it in his Statement in another place&#151;and the fact that that was passed unanimously. It gave Saddam Hussein's regime one last chance to conform with United Nations Security Council resolutions.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para52"></a>The noble Lord and the noble Baroness raised the question, "Why now?" and referred to my noble and learned friend's intervention in the media this week. I fully acknowledge that I stood at this Dispatch Box only last Thursday and said that the Government had no plans in this regard. I shall say it before any of your Lordships point it out to me&#151;I did indeed do exactly that. Let me try to explain.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para53"></a>First, we had indeed got Hutton out of the way; that was an important point. In government, despite what the noble Baroness implies, there are not instant decisions based on "we have done this and now we turn to that". The Hutton issue is important and it was only got out of the way last Thursday.
<P>


<a name="column_567"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 567</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para54"></a>We also believed&#151;I certainly implied as much, although I did not say so definitively when I spoke before your Lordships' House last week&#151;that the ISG report would be ready at some point. I did not say "in the near future" but it was certainly in my mind that it would be in the near future and I understand from my right honourable friend that it is now likely to be somewhat delayed. Again, that is an important point, because, as the noble Lord made clear, questions about trust and confidence must be addressed; they cannot be allowed to run.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para55"></a>On my part and that of many of my right honourable friends, the evidence that Dr Kay gave last week was a very important factor. Some noble Lords may have heard my right honourable friend the Prime Minister speaking at the Liaison Select Committee this morning. I found the detailed reading of the evidence before the Armed Services Committee on 28 January important in relation to the decision-taking that has come to pass.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para56"></a>That is an honest explanation. Those three factors were involved and for me&#151;I do not speak for my honourable and right honourable friends elsewhere&#151;the Kay evidence is an important factor. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister said he would put the evidence in the Library of another place; I will ensure it is put in our Library too.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para57"></a>The noble Lord talked about the evaluation of intelligence. This is a point that I have also raised today in relation to these terms of reference. Evaluation of the intelligence is not undertaken by government Ministers. In this sense "undertaken by government" comprehends Ministers and Civil Service agencies. Ministers occasionally see raw intelligence but mostly, as the noble Lord will know, by the time intelligence reaches Ministers it has gone through some evaluation process; it has been assessed. A variety of different bodies&#151;agencies, civil servants or the JIC&#151;might do that. It is important that we understand that Ministers do not go through that evaluation process; I am sure that the noble Lord is as aware of that as I am.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para58"></a>The noble Lord went on to ask whether this implied that the WMD inquiry would go wider because of what he claimed was poor planning because of poor intelligence. Again, I refer your Lordships back to the terms of reference and suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Butler, will be able to look at the precise areas that he wants to investigate within the terms of reference. These questions were raised earlier in another place.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para59"></a>The noble Lord asked about relations with the JIC. That question was partly addressed by the Hutton inquiry, although that very much involved the allegation with which the Government had some dispute. Those matters can be looked at by the noble Lord's inquiry if he wants to consider specific areas. No doubt he will make his views clear.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para60"></a>On the question of timing, the Statement makes it clear that we hope that the report will appear before the Summer Recess. As I understand it, the privacy will be analogous to that afforded to the Franks committee. We will publish what we can but that has to be consistent with security considerations.
<P>


<a name="column_568"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 568</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para61"></a>The noble Lord said, somewhat tongue in cheek, that it was an amazing coincidence that this had happened this weekend. I do not think it is an amazing coincidence&#151;I have tried to be as frank as I can. My right honourable friend in another place frequently said today that he had discussed the matter with the American Administration. Of course he had; that is right and proper. The Kay evidence has obviously played its part in terms of thinking on both sides of the Atlantic. I make no apologies for that. It is an entirely reasonable position for the Government to have articulated.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para62"></a>I turn to some of the questions raised by the noble Baroness and the basis on which the Government went to war. We discussed that very thoroughly both here and in another place. Indeed, there was a vote taken in another place before the military action began. I very much agree with the remark of my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary that it is not for an inquiry, however distinguished, to sub-contract that decision from politicians. That is a very important point in a democracy. The fact is that there is an elected House and there is your Lordships' House, which also has oversight. It is for the Houses of Parliament, not the inquiry, to look at those decisions.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para63"></a>I turn to the statement that the noble Baroness quoted. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister stood by that statement this morning in the Liaison Select Committee.
<P>

<a name="40203-04_para64"></a>My 20 minutes are up, but, if your Lordships will indulge me, I want to make a final point about the question of political judgment. The noble Baroness said she was surprised that the Conservatives had agreed with the Government on that. I am bound to say to the noble Baroness that I find her surprise really quite astonishing. When one has been in government dealing with these very difficult issues, one knows that the responsibility must lie with government. The noble Baroness knows that from her own period in government. The responsibility and accountability lie with government. The Government are not flinching from that. My right honourable friend made that clear today in another place.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-04_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee, which has already reported on some of these issues. Is it not clear from the reactions to the Hutton report that any inquiry these days is liable to be rubbished by those who do not find its conclusions to their liking? Are we not in danger of running out of distinguished public figures who are prepared to give their time and energy to produce further reports simply to attract further ill conceived criticism?

<P>
<A NAME="40203-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I have some sympathy with the comments of my noble and learned friend. I believe that the thanks we give to those who are willing to serve on this inquiry should be unstinted. Certainly, I do not envy them their task. My noble and learned friend is right. The problem with any report of this nature is that people commit themselves to a definitive view before the report is published and then find it difficult to depart from that view.
<P>


<a name="column_569"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 569</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-05_para0"></a>That is one of the penalties we pay for open government. The evidence is given in open session. Everyone assesses the evidence as it goes along, leaps to conclusions, writes them down, publishes them, talks about them and then finds it almost impossible to consider the matter in the round. Perhaps one of the benefits from conducting the inquiry in this way will be that that kind of running commentary may not feature quite so much.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord King of Bridgwater: </B>   My Lords, in inviting the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, and his colleagues to undertake this extremely difficult task, is it not imperative that before they start there is no uncertainty about the meaning of the terms of reference? I have already identified that that uncertainty seems to exist at present.
<P>

<a name="40203-05_para1"></a>Of course there is ministerial responsibility for taking a decision, but intelligence, and the decisions taken on it, is a seamless process. In that connection, the Statement says that this is to assist the Government better to evaluate and assess information that the inquiry will provide. This has nothing to do with Hutton and whether the intelligence was improperly or dishonestly used, but perhaps I may ask what was the quality of evaluation and assessment by Ministers. The Statement reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to examine any discrepancies between the intelligence gathered, evaluated and used by the Government".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-05_para2"></a>
Are we to understand that the committee is entitled to consider how it was used by the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I hope that there will not be doubt about the terms of reference. If the noble Lord means that the committee has still to explore the terms of reference, he is entirely right. As I understand it, the noble Lord, Lord Butler, is not in the country at present. However, I am sure that he will want to look closely at the terms of reference with his colleagues on the committee. Of course, they have been acquainted with the terms of reference, but the noble Lord will know that very often in setting up a committee the chairman will explore the terms of reference with the committee members to decide the appropriate limits of the remit.
<P>

<a name="40203-05_para3"></a>As regards the quality of intelligence, it is enormously important that we visit the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, regarding confidence in the gathering, quality, and evaluation of intelligence and, indeed, as the terms of reference make clear, the use of intelligence by government before the conflict and how that compares with what has been discovered now on the ground.
<P>

<a name="40203-05_para4"></a>I assure noble Lords&#151;I did not have the opportunity to do so in answering the noble Baroness&#151;that there is no question of scapegoating the intelligence services for shortcomings. We rely on our intelligence services. As the Minister responsible for counter-proliferation and counter terrorism, I have a great deal to do with them and have the utmost admiration for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-05_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, I very much welcome the setting up of this inquiry. The quality of <P>


<a name="column_570"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 570</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>our intelligence services is crucial to the long-haul struggle against terrorism that lies ahead. I speak as someone who was not able to support the military action because I did not believe that the threat was so imminent and serious. However, I did believe, for two reasons, that there were weapons of mass destruction, and my questions are related to that.
<P>

<a name="40203-05_para5"></a>First, when the United Nations inspectors left in 1998, they reported that although Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons had been destroyed, as had his means of delivery, his biological weapons were still there as were a great number of chemical weapons. Will the inquiry, as I very much hope, consider the reports of the United Nations inspectors as well as those of our own intelligence services?
<P>

<a name="40203-05_para6"></a>Secondly, I believed that weapons of mass destruction were there because of some of the reports of the highly respected independent think tanks, such as the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Where did that organisation get its information, or did it rely simply on government sources? I very much hope that the inquiry will be as wide-ranging as possible and include those two issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I thank the right reverend Prelate for his remarks. He made it very clear that he did not support the Government in the military action, as did many others in your Lordships' House, many in my own party. I respect that view, as I have made clear over and again. This was a genuine disagreement with many not only in your Lordships' House but elsewhere and throughout the country.
<P>

<a name="40203-05_para7"></a>The right reverend Prelate is right to remind the House about the UN inspectors. My right honourable friend was right to remind us about what Mr Hans Blix said in the 173 pages of unanswered questions that he published before the military conflict. Not only were WMD thought to be there by our own intelligence services and the United States intelligence services but also by the intelligence services of those who did not agree with the military conflict, that is, France and Germany.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   My Lords, if, as the Statement says and as the Minister has confirmed, the justification for the war was the breach of UN Resolution 1441 which called on Iraq to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction, and if by November 2002, the date of that resolution, Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction as now seems very likely, how could it dismantle what it did not have?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-05_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, as I am sure the noble and learned Lord is aware, Mr Hans Blix raised a number of questions, including the non-co-operation in establishing what was on the ground in Iraq. I am sure that the noble and learned Lord will recall that we had a very lengthy process with the Government of South Africa, in which we considered ways in which they were getting rid of their capabilities. We discussed that at the time. That is the way to engage: in an open and <P>


<a name="column_571"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 571</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>transparent way. Indeed, at present we are considering ways of engaging similarly with Libya on outstanding questions in relation to its weapons of mass destruction.
<P>

<a name="40203-05_para8"></a>The point here is the lack of co-operation in dealing with these issues and the material breach of UN Resolution 1441, which was unanimously found to have occurred. That was not just the view of the United States and the United Kingdom. The whole of the United Nations Security Council found that Iraq was in material breach.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, the Statement says that the Government will evaluate evidence that has been discovered by the Iraq Survey Group since the end of the conflict. The evidence given by Dr David Kay was that the two mobile weapon laboratories that we heard so much about&#151;indeed, the President of the United States mentioned them in the State of the Union address as evidence of weapons of mass destruction&#151;were no more than hydrogen producers either for hydrogen balloons or rocket fuel. Will the Minister immediately release the information about who produced the equipment that was on the back of these vehicles? They were Iraqi produced, although some of the equipment was British. Who produced this British equipment, and when did they do so? I have asked the Government this question a number of times. They have refused to answer it. I took the Government to the ombudsman, and we are waiting to receive that report. However, in the light of Dr Kay's evidence, the Government could report it. I hope that they will be able to give us that information now.
<P>

<a name="40203-05_para9"></a>The fact that the Government could not release information to the British people about equipment that was produced in Britain, and that they used exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to say that the Americans did not allow us to use that, gives the impression that there was collusion between the British Government and the American Administration to suppress the information that there was nothing untoward about these two vehicles in the case of weapons of mass destruction. I request that this issue be part of the report. If that is the case, the Government have a case to answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-05_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I do not have details about these two vehicles with me at the Dispatch Box. The noble Lord is pushing his luck in thinking that I do. Let me be clear with him. I will release whatever information that I can that is consistent with security. The noble Lord is shaking his head, but he must understand the nature of releasing this sort of information. It is not just that you tell people how your security services work, you may also be exposing sources and putting people in jeopardy. This is not a game; we are not playing some elaborate game of how much I can withhold and how much the noble Lord can winkle from me.
<P>

<a name="40203-05_para10"></a>This Government have put more information on intelligence into the public domain over the course of this year and the Hutton inquiry than any government that I can recall. I have been in and around Whitehall for some 25 years, and I have never seen openness of <P>


<a name="column_572"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 572</B></P>

<P>

<P>
<A NAME="40203-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that the Government have decided to set up an inquiry of Privy Counsellors. I was the Secretary of the first Privy Counsellors' conference on security, which looked into the disappearance and reappearance in Moscow of Burgess and Maclean. In that case, our report had two parts; one was open and the other was top secret. I remember delivering the top secret part to No. 10 Downing Street. Will the same procedure be carried out on this occasion, with an open part of the report and a secret part?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, as I understand it, that is the case. There will be an open report, and there will be parts of the report that cannot be put into the public domain, because of the nature of the evidence that will be taken. The noble Lord has reminded us of the enormous wealth of experience that there is on these issues in your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, the legal basis of the military action was UN Security Council Resolution 1441, which was based on the belief that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction that he was concealing. Should the committee consider whether we really had a legal case for military action, particularly in the absence of the second Security Council resolution, which we never managed to obtain? Will the committee be shown the Attorney-General's full opinion, which the Government have so far refused to disclose?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-06_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, on that last point, it is the convention that the Government do not expose the advice of the Attorney-General. We have been over this point many, many times before. Had the noble Lord's party been on the committee it could have argued vigorously on that point.
<P>

<a name="40203-06_para0"></a>As far as UN Security Council Resolution 1441 is concerned, the legal advice was based&#151;as I remember debating at some length in your Lordships' House, when the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was a robust interlocutor&#151;on not just Resolution 1441, but Resolution 1441 in relation to Resolution 678 and Resolution 687. If the noble Lord is really suggesting <P>

Will my noble friend, even at this late stage, make a special plea to the Liberal Democrat Benches to reconsider their decision? They have excluded Mr Alan Beith MP from this committee. He is one of the members of the committee with the most experience, as he has been on the committee since its inception in 1993. He knows the security services through and through, and he has extensive knowledge of every aspect of their operations. He has a formidable brain, and he is exactly the kind of person required on that committee&#151;to act like a ferret to find out where the truth lies. I appeal to them to reconsider.

<A NAME="40203-06_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I have enormous sympathy with what my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours said. I very much regret this. After all, as the noble Baroness has told us on a number of occasions, the Liberal Democrat Benches have a different view of the rights and wrongs of what happened in relation to Iraq. That has been a valuable contribution, which has kept us all up to the mark. The noble Baroness never has any nonsense about anything&#151;not that she gets nonsense from this Dispatch Box&#151;she is very clear in the way that she pursues these issues.
<P>

<a name="40203-06_para1"></a>I am not as well acquainted with Mr Alan Beith MP as my noble friend, because he had experience in the other place. Nevertheless, I regret enormously that the Liberal Democrat Benches will not be making the sort of point that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was able to make to us a moment ago. It is sad that they will shout from the sidelines and not in the heart of the debate. That is to be regretted.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-06_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Biffen: </B>   My Lords, it would be churlish not to admit that the Minister has given a formidable exposition of the latest turn in the Government's policy, although with a little more contrition than she showed last Thursday.
<P>

<a name="40203-06_para2"></a>The reality has already been indicated by my noble friend Lord King of Bridgwater. Plenty of arguments are going on before this inquiry has even begun about its terms of reference, and the like. It is not a shortage of discussion or a shortage of committees that we have in the prosecution of this war; it is a lack of confidence on the part of the British public.

<a name="40203-06_para3"></a>Absent spectres from this evening's miserable feast are Robin Cook and Kenneth Clarke, who, in their respective positions, have been able to give voice to the powerful feeling that there is throughout the country that we are fighting an American war, on American terms, in a sequence of events dictated by Americans. That is no position from which to summons national support, whether through further meetings or further committees, or by a more direct appeal on the part of the Prime Minister to the public at large. The truth is: we are in this position, and it is a miserable position in which to be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-06_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure what the noble Lord's question was. I did not detect one in the exposition that he just gave us. I am sorry if I appeared to be contrite today; I did not mean to be. I meant to offer your Lordships a clear explanation of the Government's position. I hope that I did that. I shall have to watch my step.
<P>

<a name="40203-06_para4"></a>Was it an "American war"? No, it was not. It was not an American war, and my right honourable friend the Prime Minister fought for his point of view over and over again in another place and was the first Prime Minister to subject that point of view to a vote of the House of Commons. There was nothing "American" about that; it was very British. If I may say so, it was very much in tune with the way in which my right honourable friend conducts himself.

<a name="40203-06_para5"></a>Report received.
<P>

<a name="40203-06_para6"></a>Clause 1 [Transfer to Lord Chancellor of functions relating to Judicial Appointments Commission]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-06_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 1.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-06_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40203-06_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I sometimes think that, now that the nation is in the mood for inquiries, it would be exciting to have an inquiry into what intelligence provoked the Government to bring a Bill of this kind to the House. It has been brought to us in its present form for the second time in two years.
<P>

<a name="40203-06_para9"></a>In Committee, when I spoke on Clause 1, I hoped that somehow I would be enlightened about the Bill. Sadly, that was not the case. I accept that the Tory amendment relating to the Lord Chancellor was accepted, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, knew of and alluded to proposed changes in the role of the Lord Chancellor, I have to ask what was really achieved by that concession.
<P>

<a name="40203-06_para10"></a>My party is opposed to the whole concept of devolving judicial appointments, especially, I emphasise, the appointment of our 17 High Court judges, as it does not go hand-in-hand with the devolution of responsibility for criminal justice. The Criminal Justice Review saw the devolution of judicial appointments happening only in the context of the devolution of criminal justice. They are <P>


<a name="column_575"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 575</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>two aspects of the same issue, so why separate them? One recalls that, at Second Reading, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, indicated that the review had shown that something like 77 per cent of the population had expressed confidence in the fairness of judges and magistrates. Why, then, the urgency?
<P>

<a name="40203-06_para11"></a>I ask that in the light of the Government's promise that none of it would happen without broad support from the political parties in Northern Ireland. The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, has written to me, and I am grateful for his correspondence. However, I am unhappy that he has confirmed the reason why the Government broke that promise. Although the noble Lord does not spell it out, the reality is that, at Weston Park, where we went to meet the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in good faith, a nasty little deal was done with Sinn Fein, leading ultimately to the Joint Declaration. I cannot say that political parties in Northern Ireland were not properly consulted&#151;they were not consulted at all about some of the important points.
<P>

<a name="40203-06_para12"></a>With no devolution of responsibility for criminal justice, we would be content for Northern Ireland to be part of whatever emerges with regard to a Judicial Appointments Commission for England and Wales. Does the noble Lord foresee the composition of the commission for England and Wales having the same balance as that for Northern Ireland? If not, why not?
<P>

<a name="40203-06_para13"></a>I end, as I began, by questioning the intelligence behind what is happening with the Bill. The one thing that we see again and again in Northern Ireland legislation is an entrenchment&#151;a re-entrenchment&#151;of the things that derive from sectarianism. The overall interests of the community at large are ignored&#151;sometimes one tradition in the community, sometimes another&#151;and the overall effect is that the community as a whole in Northern Ireland suffers from the compulsory re-entrenchment of sectarianism that is built into every Bill that the Government bring forward on such issues. I beg to move.

Were the noble Lord to divide the House, I would not feel able to support him in the Lobbies. However, I have made the point several times that I disagree strongly with the timing of the Bill and many of the issues in it. We will come to those issues later.

<A NAME="40203-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  My Lords, I am glad of the opportunity to respond to the two questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass, on the clause. One is, "Why now?", and the other is, "What is the genesis of some of the measures?".
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para0"></a>The Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 provides for the Judicial Appointments Commission to be established after the devolution of responsibility for justice matters <P>


<a name="column_576"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 576</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the Assembly. The purpose of the Judicial Appointments Commission is to enhance the process for judicial appointments. I hope that the House will agree that bringing forward the establishment of the commission should, in principle, be welcomed as part of that process. I shall explain why I believe that it does.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para1"></a>Speaking personally, I am confident that the commission will make an important contribution to building greater public confidence in the Northern Ireland justice system, although I know that, as yet, the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass, is not persuaded of that. We seek to strengthen the independence of the judiciary, which is essential to any justice system, perhaps especially in Northern Ireland. Section 1 of the 2002 Act states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Those with responsibility for the administration of justice must uphold the continued independence of the judiciary".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-07_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40203-07_para3"></a>I should like to spell out in a little more detail the slightly complicated issue of which aspects of the Bill are being brought in now and which are being brought in subsequently. That is, perhaps, the first time that we have done that, and it may assist, even if it does not set the noble Lord's mind totally at rest. Our position is that the commission will stand on its own merits. First, it will enhance judicial independence. For the first time in Northern Ireland, we will have a statutory mechanism separating the selection of persons for listed judicial offices from the Ministers who appoint or recommend for appointment. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that the separation of powers is a keystone of democracy and should be vigorously pursued.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para4"></a>Secondly, one of the tasks of the commission will be to encourage diversity in the judiciary in terms of gender balance and the representation of those from ethnic communities. We discussed those issues in Committee. It is an important objective, and there was strong support for it in our earlier discussions, subject to the overriding question of merit. There is sense, therefore, in getting on with it.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para5"></a>Thirdly, the establishment of the commission with responsibility for the appointment of the judiciary is in keeping with the broad thrust of government policy. There is already a commission in Scotland; one is proposed in England and Wales; and the 2002 Act provided a statutory one ahead of the pack in Northern Ireland. The Bill allows that part of its role to be brought into operation earlier than might otherwise be the case.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para6"></a>Finally, political interference in the appointments process of judges is to be guarded against, and the commission will have a strong safeguard. We shall talk more about that later. The Lord President and I have had useful discussions with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, on some of those issues, and I hope that the correspondence has clarified some of the measures in the Bill and when they will be implemented.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para7"></a>For the record, I shall now give a little more detail. The Bill provides for the establishment of the Judicial Appointments Commission before devolution by transferring to the Lord Chancellor functions in relation to the commission that the First Minister and the Deputy <P>


<a name="column_577"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 577</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>First Minister would have had, were devolution to have happened. We are not in a devolved state, so the Lord Chancellor takes over functions regarding the Judicial Appointments Commission. The Lord Chancellor will appoint commission members, and the commission will be required to select a person for appointment to a listed judicial office.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para8"></a>The Lord Chancellor will also have the power to require the commission to reconsider its decision as to the person to be selected, and to deal with the outcome of that reconsideration. There are also a range of consequential functions, such as receiving copies of the annual report, making grants to the commission, and so on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, how on earth can we have what has been described as a more acceptable judiciary&#151;if we get devolution&#151;if we are to revert to the position stated in the Bill that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, working together, shall appoint Her Majesty's judges, and the same First Minister and Deputy First Minister shall dismiss Her Majesty's judges, if they feel so inclined? Is there any hope of a neutral and widely respected judiciary? Does that now depend on our not ever having devolution? When devolution is brought back, we shall bring back the divisive factor of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister appointing and dismissing judges.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, neither of those propositions is true. We shall come to those issues in subsequent parts of our consideration on Report, when I shall be pleased to set out in detail why they are not true. At this point, I shall address the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para9"></a>The Lord Chancellor, unlike the First Minister or Deputy First Minister, already has the power to recommend appointments to a listed judicial office. Therefore, all that needs to be done is to ensure that in making those recommendations and appointments, the Lord Chancellor acts on the recommendation of the commission. I am simply explaining how technically the Bill puts the Lord Chancellor in a pre-devolution position. The commission will have another role under the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 later on when devolution takes place, which is to advise the First Minister and Deputy First Minster on the procedure that they should adopt in formulating a recommendation to the Prime Minister. We shall come to those issues later today.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para10"></a>The appointments of Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justice of Appeal will continue before devolution to be made as they are now. Appointments to the office of High Court judge will also still be made by Her Majesty on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. I hope that it will be reasonably clear that the functions of the commission in selecting persons to office up to and including High Court judges will be activated prior to devolution of responsibility for judicial functions. The commission's other function, however, in providing advice in relation to the <P>


<a name="column_578"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 578</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>formulation of recommendations for appointment to Lord Chief Justice or Lord Justice of Appeal will not be commenced at this stage. Why does that matter? The Judicial Appointments Commission fulfils two functions. First, it puts a transparent process in place for the appointment of judicial office holders, which we believe strengthens the independence of the judiciary. Secondly, it can begin work on a process of seeking over a period of time to work towards an appropriate process, subject to merit, to increase the diversity of the judiciary.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para11"></a>I also affirm that there has been no breach of promise. The 2002 Act was crafted in the context of hoping and expecting that devolution was about to happen. Unfortunately, devolution is suspended, but on this day we are seeing the start of discussions around the Belfast agreement, which we all hope will lead to the possibility of a recommencement of the Assembly and devolution, but no one knows that for certain. We are, therefore, in a strange limbo land at present. There is benefit, for the reasons I have given, in making progress.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para12"></a>It is also not true that the nine measures that came out from the Hillsborough agreement with relevance to the Bill being discussed today&#151;specifically the issues around judicial appointments&#151;were not the product of pressure from Sinn Fein. Other political parties were interested in those issues, not Sinn Fein. It is not the right way forward for Northern Ireland affairs to be made as part of the Judicial Appointments Commission for England and Wales. We want to move towards more self government in Northern Ireland, subject to a time and place process. I very much hope that the reverse of the entrenchment of sectarianism will be the product of such a process.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para13"></a>There was consultation with the parties. The Bill's contents were discussed in detail with the local political parties at Hillsborough, including the Ulster Unionist Party. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, that the devolution of justice and judicial appointments should go hand in hand. The JAC will make its recommendations to the Lord Chancellor, and the provisions on senior judicial appointments and judicial removal will not be commenced before justice is devolved to Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para14"></a>I hope that I have done better than last time in addressing the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for addressing the points that I raised. I note that I did not have much competition on this amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para15"></a>Will the Minister clarify a point? When he talked about the Hillsborough round of talks, he seemed to say, "and" the Ulster Unionists, as though somehow there had been encouragement or pressure from the Ulster Unionists to devolve judicial powers. He and I both know that that was not the case. The Ulster Unionist Party was totally opposed, and will remain totally opposed to the devolution of criminal justice responsibilities until there is absolute certainty of <P>


<a name="column_579"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 579</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>stability in Northern Ireland. I hope that the noble Lord will confirm that so that there is no confusion in anyone's mind that somehow my party is of a mind to have early devolution of criminal justice.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para16"></a>I have one or two other very brief points to make. I concur with my noble friend Lord Molyneaux, if not for the same reason, when he alludes to the separation of powers. It is nonsense to talk about the separation of the judicial process from the political process, and then to suggest that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will be indulging in what can only be Buggins' turn. It will be nothing else. If that does not divide the judicial process along sectarian lines in Northern Ireland, I simply do not know what does.
<P>

<a name="40203-07_para17"></a>Those are my reasons for opposing everything that I see in the Bill as being not only unhelpful but also dangerous. However, I am not one to waste the time of the House. I have listened to what the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has intimated&#151;would the Minister like to respond?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, out of courtesy I shall respond to the specific point made by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, about the Ulster Unionist Party and Hillsborough. I responded to whether there had been consultation and involvement of political parties in the Hillsborough agreement and I commented on the fact that the Ulster Unionist Party had been involved in the Hillsborough discussions. I made no comment about its stance on the early devolution of justice. I hope we agree in part, if not in totality.

<A NAME="40203-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I accept what the noble Lord says. I did not want there to be any doubt. I may go into a public house, but I shall not be one of those who leaves drunk. Our position is much the same in regard to the Ulster Unionists; we may have been involved in the talks, but that does not indicate any concurrence with what has been brought forward against our wishes. However, as I was about to say before the Minister intervened, at this stage I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>


<a name="column_580"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 580</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para4"></a>We have discussed Amendment No. 2 for some considerable time. We discussed much of it when dealing with the previous Bill and we have been over it in Committee. For me, the Government's proposals in relation to this item may seem like only one small step, but it is a step in the wrong direction, towards more politicisation in the appointment of Northern Ireland judges. Noble Lords will find that all my amendments and all my arguments will focus on trying to prevent the Government increasing politicisation of the judicial system in Northern Ireland as opposed to decreasing it. That is what they declare they are doing, but I do not believe that is what they are doing.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para5"></a>All the changes that are being made mount up, and cumulatively we are faced with a system which does not guarantee judicial independence and which threatens the until now unimpeachable record of those judges who have dispensed justice in Northern Ireland thus far. If appointment is to be on merit, what possible basis is there for having an equal number of judicial and lay members on the Judicial Appointments Commission? The Secretary of State claims that eight out of 13 of the members are judicial professionals. That is misinformation because he includes the solicitor and barrister under that umbrella of judicial professionalism. As I understand it, those people do not take the judicial oath and are not normally considered to be part of the judiciary.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, also tried to claim that the lay members would in some way be vital in trying,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to widen the diversity of the judiciary"&#151;[Official Report, 15/1/04; col. 690],
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-08_para7"></a>
and would aid "public confidence" in the judiciary. We accept that there should be some representations from the lay community on the Judicial Appointments Commission, but while it hopefully plays a useful role in enhancing confidence in the judicial system, it also runs a real risk that political considerations will assume too great a prominence.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para8"></a>One matter that I believe has been missed by the Minister and his colleagues&#151;particularly when I look at the make up of the suggested Judicial Appointments Commission for England and Wales&#151;is that in Northern Ireland 95 per cent, or probably 100 per cent, of those who are likely to be appointed to the commission will be extremely politically sensitive, extremely politically active, and extremely politically aware. Without wishing to insult anyone in the kingdom, particularly in England and Wales, I suspect that a similar group of people from whom one could select members for the JAC for England and Wales, would probably contain fewer than 20 per cent and may be fewer than 10 per cent of people who would be politically sensitive to one party or another or to one issue or another in relation to appointments to the judiciary. A crucial plank in my argument is that it is quite wrong to overplay and to oversubscribe to the lay element on the Judicial Appointments Commission. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   My Lords, I adopt the argument of my noble friend Lord Glentoran in supporting the amendment. Ministers insist that the overriding and dominant criterion for the <P>


<a name="column_581"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 581</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appointment of a judge shall be merit. Of course, that is right; that has to be so. The Bill stipulates that and it does so on ministerial instructions. It could hardly be otherwise if a non-politicised judiciary is the aim.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para9"></a>However, it is not enough for Ministers merely to proclaim that; they have to go further and in the language of Cranmer they have to "ensue it". That means identifying what constitutes merit and examining who is best fitted to discern it among the pool of likely candidates. I suggest that in that context merit includes displaying the judicial qualities of independence, integrity, impartiality, intellect, courage, courtesy and efficiency in the dispatch of business.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para10"></a>Therefore, the assessment of a candidate for those qualities surely has to be a specialised business. The reason is that those qualities, or the absence of them, will have been displayed when candidates have been seen at work&#151;in action&#151;whether as an advocate or as a judge. It is hard to see where a lay person can have as useful, or at least equally useful, a standpoint as a judicial person. The assessment by judges themselves must be the most reliable that is available. They will have reviewed the summings up, the sentences, the judgments and the transcripts of trials over which inferior judges will have presided; they will have seen how the candidates have performed. They will have observed the performance of advocates appearing before them, whether at first instance or on appeal.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para11"></a>It is true that the opinions of barristers and solicitors will go some way towards approaching the value of the experience of a judge in this context, provided that they are advocate solicitors or advocate barristers, which is not specified in the Bill. I respectfully suggest that a lay magistrate in Northern Ireland can have had very little experience that is relevant and I suggest that a lay person who is not a magistrate can rarely bring experience that is at all relevant. Lay people may ask themselves, "What can we bring?", and they will have to reply in the words of the well known hymn,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Just as I am, I come".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-08_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40203-08_para13"></a>That will be very nice, but what will it contribute, beyond what we misleadingly call transparency? In Northern Ireland there is some value in that, but there is also some danger. As my noble friend has said, I believe that it will bring the risk that certain attributes, quite extraneous to those judicial ones, that make for judicial merit, will be looked for by the public and disproportionately rewarded, most notably those of background and religion&#151;where does the candidate come from?
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para14"></a>I therefore endorse what my noble friend Lord Glentoran said in Committee. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The fact that the Lord Chief Justice and five judges could be outvoted on this commission can make no sense if one has the objective of maintaining that the judicial system be depoliticised and clear of political influences".&#151;[Official Report, 15/1/04; col. 687.]

I would add that if we are to ensure the true predominance of merit as the criterion, the only reliable and safe way to do it is by putting the judicial members in the majority on the commission.

<A NAME="40203-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord seeking to group and to debate all the amendments together or to debate this amendment and then move on? Members of the House may become confused about the point at which they should speak.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I would not wish other Members to be in the same state as me; namely, one of confusion. The next group of amendments is not entirely mine. If the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, intends to push this amendment to a vote, I would be happy to accede to the noble Baroness's point and combine the next group of amendments with this group.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I do not wish to group the next group of amendments with this one. I am quite happy to stay where we are.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-08_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, in that case, we have clarified the position. At this stage, Members will speak to this amendment only.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-08_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   Indeed, my Lords, I will do so. When we consider the next group, I shall be able to speak with much greater brevity.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, said in Committee:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The further argument was made by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, and others that the lay members have no function at all, or they should have a function only if they are expert in some way in legal processes. I believe that that short changes the role of the commission".&#151;[Official Report, 15/1/04; col. 690.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-08_para17"></a>
I could not quite understand what the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, was intimating. I would have thought that expertise, no matter how little, was an absolute necessity. There would not be much point in employing a sausage maker to repair my motor car. Hence, it was difficult to follow his arguments, which appeared to be a series of unconvincing contradictions. He said that the system had proved itself over 30 difficult years. However, we have to ensure public confidence. I had thought that 77 per cent of the public has confidence in judges and magistrates. That point was conveyed in this House by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para18"></a>If lay people are involved in the Judicial Appointments Commission, they will be seen as "quango-ites". If 77 per cent of the public has confidence in judges and magistrates, not even 0.7 per cent of it would have confidence in many of those who are mostly unelected and often unelectable. Quango-ism in Northern Ireland <P>


<a name="column_583"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 583</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has become a kind of covert profession. It is pretty much despised. There are exceptions in the form of some very able, publicly spirited people, but there are others whom I would fear if they made up the lay element of a Judicial Appointments Commission.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para19"></a>When one comes to selecting those lay people, they will inevitably be selected because they are Protestant or because they are Catholic. However often I speak about this Bill, I have to emphasise the sectarianising that is inherent in it. Some of us have worked a lifetime to try to reduce that in Northern Irish society.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para20"></a>I referred in Committee to the Minister's remarks on merit at Second Reading. She had said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Merit has been and will continue to be the overriding principle for judicial appointments".&#151;[Official Report, 16/12/03; col. 1092.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-08_para21"></a>
She said "overriding". Merit cannot be overriding if it is subject to one condition after another. That is exactly what we are hearing from government. The condition will be traditional balance in terms of only one criterion: Protestant or Catholic. I could never concur with that. My party has worked for years to try to eliminate it.
<P>

<a name="40203-08_para22"></a>I shall draw attention to research paper No. 5 that was commissioned during the review of the criminal justice system. Page 60 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The international models of Appointments Committees have varying degrees of similarity. Most feature a Chief Justice as Chairperson; representatives from courts, Bar Council and legal profession. When lay members are included they are chosen from individuals with a sophisticated knowledge of appointments procedure and legal issues".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-08_para23"></a>
I do not know how we can bring that kind of professional advice to the review of criminal justice. The Minister cannot argue that meritocracy and competency are overriding, while all those elements of sectarianism are being built in. It does not square up. That is the sad reality of the situation.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, I am somewhat depressed by the denigration of the contribution of the lay element to appointments. I always listen to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, with great respect, but we should not be seduced by his mellifluous articulation of his points. His words smack heavily, as they have done before, of those of an eloquent shop steward for the legal trade union. There is no question that the balance that we have is the right one. Undoubtedly, the lay members will listen most assiduously to what the legal and judicial representatives say. However, selecting on the basis of integrity, knowledge, independence and all the other criteria referred to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, is not the preserve of the legal profession. Many of us feel that we can discriminate between those who possess them and those who do not. The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, to some extent, and, in his most mellifluous way, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, have rather over-egged the pudding in making their point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the amendment would increase the number of judicial members and decrease the number of lay members on the Judicial Appointments Commission. To some extent, it is <P>


<a name="column_584"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 584</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>surprising to be debating this amendment because the Bill does nothing to change the composition of the Judicial Appointments Commission which this House and another place passed into legislation nearly two years ago. That was a decision that Parliament made at that point in time, and I think it was the right decision. The composition was debated at length in both Houses during the passage of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002.
<P>

<a name="40203-09_para0"></a>The 2002 Act reflected Recommendation 78 of the Criminal Justice Review which sought to have a careful balance in terms of the commission's membership. Indeed, as I made clear in Committee, out of a total of 13 commission members, eight will have knowledge of the law, legal processes and legal systems. I sought to say that there would be eight members of a commission of 13 who would either be judicial or legal professionals. It may well have been slightly condensed in the process of transmogrification. However, the point I was making was that there were eight people who were either acting as judges or who were professional lawyers.
<P>

<a name="40203-09_para1"></a>Furthermore, the chairman of the Judicial Appointments Commission is the Lord Chief Justice himself. He is sitting on top of this apex, bringing all of the weight of his office, experience and intelligence to its functions. In that respect, the Judicial Appointments Commission in Northern Ireland is quite different from the system currently operating in Scotland and what is proposed for England and Wales. I make no issue with that&#151;there are good reasons for where the 2002 Act positioned it, and we think that that is right. Therefore, we are slightly at a loss about why the question is being reopened at this time, given that we have had some good debates and have sought, through Parliament, to settle the matter.
<P>

<a name="40203-09_para2"></a>Let me turn to a number of the points that were made in the addresses to the amendment. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, is right to bring the issue of appointment on merit before us early in our proceedings. He said that Ministers proclaimed that this was the objective. Yes, they do, but we go substantially further than that&#151;we enshrine it in the legislation. It spells out with absolute clarity that there is only one criterion for this Judicial Appointments Commission making a decision on a judicial appointment, and that is merit. In that sense, this goes way beyond proclamation&#151;we are enshrining it in legislation. The commission is statutorily charged to behave in that way.
<P>

<a name="40203-09_para3"></a>Identifying which candidates have judicial skills is clearly part of the job of the commission. Judicial skills are partly about knowledge of the law and partly about knowledge of judicial processes. They also include some of the other human skills needed to manage the judicial process in ways that build the confidence of the community that justice is being fairly done. Undoubtedly the judicial members of the commission will be powerfully positioned to have their arguments on some of those skills, but lay members may make a contribution when it comes to some of the other skills as well. Lay <P>


<a name="column_585"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 585</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>members will also make a contribution in terms of looking at the selection procedures&#151;the advertising, recruitment and attraction of people&#151;to ensure that a rich pool of talented candidates is coming forward for consideration by the panel.
<P>

<a name="40203-09_para4"></a>I should also mark the fact that the Judicial Appointments Commission has a second role. It does not just make short-term decisions about judicial appointment. However&#151;I repeat this so that the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, is in no doubt about this&#151;its secondary role in trying to promote a more diverse judiciary is subordinate to the appointment on merit. In other words, it only does those other things subordinate to merit, not the other way round, as I think it was being interpreted.
<P>

<a name="40203-09_para5"></a>We had a good discussion on these issues in Committee, and it seemed to me that there was a strong measure of consensus. The judiciary in Northern Ireland, no different from that in England, is not, in gender terms, representative of society broadly. Therefore the commission has to think what can be done over five, 10 or more years to ensure that people of talent in all walks of life come forward. That is its second role. It is self-evident that a commission which has on it lay people with relevant experience will be very powerful. That was what I was meant when I referred in Committee to short-changing.
<P>

<a name="40203-09_para6"></a>On sectarianism, the Lord Chancellor appoints the lay members of the Judicial Appointments Commission in the pre-devolution situation. They will be selected in accordance with the Commission of Public Appointments code of practice. In addition to having to swear an undertaking to uphold peace and justice, they must be able to command the confidence of a broad swathe of society in Northern Ireland and, by their stature and integrity, have demonstrated their ability to contribute to decisions in a non-sectarian way. While Scotland does not have the same level of sectarianism that Northern Ireland has, tragically, had, we have already seen a Judicial Appointments Commission in Scotland chaired by a lay member making good progress on addressing some of these issues, albeit in an advisory capacity. I think confidence is developing in Scotland in that respect.
<P>

<a name="40203-09_para7"></a>We got it right when we established the composition in 2002, and we are right now to implement some, if not all, of the Judicial Appointments Commission's functions because we need to make progress in the areas I have outlined. I very much hope that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, will feel minded to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his lengthy explanation. However, I do not really understand why the Government are sticking to their guns so strongly on this and they probably do not understand why I am sticking to mine. Neither the Criminal Justice Review&#151;see paragraph 6.103&#151;nor the implementation plan&#151;see page 44&#151;called for a majority of lay over judicial members.

<a name="40203-09_para8"></a>I would be very satisfied if the Government would undertake that the casting vote was left with the Lord Chief Justice, but I feel that in the Province that I know and have lived in for many years, the climate is not right to have a commission to appoint the judiciary made up with a majority of non-judicial persons. I should like to test the opinion of the House.

<A NAME="40203-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glentoran </B>   moved Amendment No. 4:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 10, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-10_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40203-10_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 4 is another amendment that we have already discussed at considerable length. In Committee we clarified the important point that the Lord Chief Justice who chairs the committee sits ex officio and is therefore not caught by the 10-year limit. The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"on promotion to another tier of the judiciary, a person can have another opportunity to enter the judicial appointments commission".&#151;[Official Report, 15/1/04; col. 695.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-10_para2"></a>
If that is so, it would go far to meet our concerns as the high flyers will almost certainly be promoted through the system, typically from High Court judge to Lord Chief Justice or resident magistrate to county court judge. But if what the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, said in Committee is correct, what is the point of the statutory restriction as it will so seldom apply? In my view it is far from clear that sub-paragraph (1A)&#151;I read it several times along with advisers&#151;means what the Minister thought that it meant and I hope that it means. I await the noble Lord's comments on that point. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40203-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am very glad to repeat and re-emphasise the explanation and the commitment that I gave in Committee in this respect. While the clause that we are discussing puts all judicial members on a level playing field regarding their terms of office&#151;there seem to be good reasons for doing that both in principle and also because it was one element of the Hillsborough agreement&#151;a lay member or a judicial member can serve five years as their first term. They are eligible to be reappointed for a second term, if that is the decision of the relevant appointing body. That second term can either be served directly subsequent to the first term or after a period of time has elapsed.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para3"></a>It is also the case&#151;I again emphasise this, as I think I have said, and I may have also written to the noble Lord&#151;that were a judicial office holder to be promoted, he or she is open to a further opportunity for appointment as they may then move into a different category. For example, if they move into the High Court, they would be open to a further opportunity for consideration and selection. In theory in extremis one can envisage the slightly bizarre situation in which a <P>


<a name="column_589"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 589</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>person who was promoted could end up serving on the Judicial Appointments Commission for 20 years. That is the theoretical extreme logic of the measure. However, I should be surprised if that occurred. As I signalled in Committee, there are good reasons for wanting turnaround while also wanting experienced people to serve on the body.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para4"></a>In essence I can give exactly the assurance that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, seeks. People may be reappointed to serve a second term in their existing role or be reappointed in a different capacity if they are promoted. Why is that? As I have signalled, it seems right in principle that both lay and judicial members should be on a level playing field as that was part of the Hillsborough agreement. I hope that having re-emphasised what I said in Committee, the anxieties of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, will be appeased.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that very clear explanation which I accept. Being rather churlish, I hope that the draftsmen and officials will reconsider the relevant phrasing to reassure themselves that future generations will interpret it correctly. The provision comprises only about three lines. It is rather difficult to interpret it correctly unless the relevant explanation in Hansard is attached to it.

<a name="40203-10_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I return to the question of what is actually meant by the wording in the Bill. I do not care whether the relevant phrase is "representative of the community" or "reflective of the community". Clause 3 is entitled:

<P>

and we are not of the opinion that males are cleverer and more able than females or vice versa, or that black people are more able than white or coloured people or vice versa, or that Protestants are more able than Catholics or vice versa, new subsections (9) and (10) of Clause 3 are absolutely unnecessary. However&#151;I do not need to emphasise this point much more&#151;I and anyone who comes from Northern Ireland believes that this has to do with creating a sectarian trade-off&#151;nothing more and nothing less. It is about creating a sectarian trade-off. I am as opposed to a sectarian trade-off as I am opposed&#151;and have been opposed in my 20 or so years in public life&#151;to sectarianism. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, when the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, replies to the amendment will he say whether there is a legal precedent for using the word "reflective"? He and I and other Members of the House probably have a fair idea of what is intended by the word but it would be slightly disappointing if a subsequent judicial interpretation showed that we were wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I too hope that the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, can clarify one or two matters when he replies to the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para13"></a>In the course of replying to Amendment No. 1, the noble Lord mentioned that the Government aimed to achieve gender balance in the Northern Ireland judiciary. Does that mean that where two equally well qualified candidates present themselves&#151;one male and one female&#151;the woman will always be chosen until such time, many years hence, when 50 or 51 per cent of the judiciary in Northern Ireland is female? I do not think that any other interpretation is possible but there may be one of which I am unaware.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para14"></a>Leaving aside the question of gender, what other characteristics are sought in the Government's ambition to achieve a judiciary "reflective of the community"? Both the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, and the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, have assumed that religious affiliation will be the main criterion, judging by their earlier contributions this afternoon, but I wonder whether they are right. If a Roman Catholic Unionist&#151;whether with a capital U or a lower case u&#151;were to be proposed to fill the notional Roman Catholic quota, my guess is that he or she would be totally unacceptable to Sinn Fein and quite probably unacceptable to the SDLP as well.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para15"></a>Therefore, "reflective of the community" could only mean reflective of the political community, with 30 per cent of new appointments going to known DUP supporters&#151;assuming they have all the correct legal <P>


<a name="column_591"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 591</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>qualifications&#151;and 23 per cent or so going to Sinn Fein supporters and so on. Can the Minister confirm that that is the case?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-10_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment. Regarding the word "reflective", I am involved in the Northern Ireland Policing Board. When we chose members of the district policing partnerships, of which the noble Lord, Lord Maginiss, will be aware, we had to appoint people who were "reflective" of the community. The first issue to be taken into account was religion. That was not our choice, but, we were told, it was through the "political correctness" of the situation. That is how it will be done. The second issue was gender but the first was clearly religion.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para16"></a>I have one question for the Minister. If merit is the number one objective, how on earth can that be distorted by bringing religion or gender into it? That is not possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-10_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I thought that we had one of the best discussions on the Bill on such issues in Committee. I value the exchange that we had with the Opposition Front Bench, particularly with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para17"></a>I start by addressing Amendment No. 6, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, which would remove the requirement that is inserted into Section 5 of the 2002 Act by Clause 3 that the Judicial Appointments Commission should,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"engage in a programme of action designed to secure"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-10_para18"></a>
a judiciary,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reflective of the community in Northern Ireland".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-10_para19"></a>
I made it clear in Committee and shall do so again that the duty to engage in a programme of action is subject to the immutable principle of appointment on merit.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para20"></a>The Judicial Appointments Commission can make a decision only on which applicant is best for that judicial post. It can take no account of whether the person is a man or a woman; whether they are from one community or another; or whether they are of one ethnic group or another. The Bill could not be clearer. Appointment has to be on merit.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para21"></a>However, in our discussions in Committee we addressed the issue of the judiciary of Northern Ireland no differently from issues relating to the judiciary in Britain. If one looks at the composition of the judiciary in Northern Ireland&#151;which I repeat is deeply impressive in very many respects in terms of its judicial skill and courage over some difficult periods of time&#151;it is apparent that 87 per cent are men and 13 per cent are women. The question that faces society, which is the subject of this part of the Bill, starts from the premise that we talked about then: no one in the House believes that women are more stupid than men. Therefore, that begs a question: what is in the nature of the processes that leads to the disproportionate composition of the judiciary in Northern Ireland?
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para22"></a>The nature of that discussion in Committee was that one had to ask the commission and others in Northern Ireland society&#151;the Bar Council and the Law Society&#151;<P>


<a name="column_592"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 592</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to reflect on the nature of judicial careers, including the way in which people came forward for them, to see whether anything in the nature of those processes was likely to lead to a disproportionate composition. I shall not repeat the arguments for those who want to engage further. We have set out why the issue matters profoundly. I shall not weary the House with that again, but the issue is asking the commission what it can do to give leadership in civil society in Northern Ireland over a period of years to seek to bring about change.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para23"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, who was clear that we are talking about actions that might take five, 10 or 15 years. But they are important to try to redress the composition of a judiciary that, while it is eminently skilled in what it does, is not reflective of the diversity of society. That was the essential issue and although in Committee I churlishly refused to accept the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about a continuing programme of action, I agree with him that that was what the issue was about. Therefore, we tabled Amendment No. 7 to make it absolutely clear, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, invited us, that a programme of action by the Judicial Appointments Commission was necessary over a period of years.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para24"></a>Regarding the concerns raised by noble Lords, I gladly pay tribute to the reminder by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, of his lifetime opposition to sectarianism. We recognise how difficult that is in Northern Ireland and how that requires leadership and courage. But we are not putting the issue of sectarianism at risk by the Bill. Regarding the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, about what matters most, I said in Committee that one had to expect a judiciary, everything being equal, to be roughly reflective of society.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para25"></a>The greatest deviance in society is not community background but gender. That is my direct response. We do not know the exact figures for community background in Northern Ireland, but the best estimates suggest that probably around 35 per cent come from a Roman Catholic background and about 65 percent come from a Protestant background. That is not to say that there is anything fundamentally wrong or that there is perfection. But the last thing that the Judicial Appointments Commission is entitled to do is to make any decisions on appointments based on the community background of people. I am signalling that the issue matters most on gender, given my figures.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para26"></a>Regarding ethnicity, there is such a small ethnic minority population in Northern Ireland that there are no people on the judiciary from ethnic minorities, as they represent only 1 per cent of the population. They are small figures. It is not a situation of appointing people in order to achieve quotas. Quotas are illegal&#151;as set out by the thrust of the Bill. Age is another issue that one might look at, but there is a limit to what might be achieved regarding age, given that holders of judicial office often require many years of experience. Therefore, one cannot expect a complete balance there of adult society, for obvious reasons.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para27"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked me about the terms "representative" and "reflective". We have changed the wording to "reflective" because the Liberal Democrats pointed out&#151;although I cannot remember the context&#151;that it was a better word. I stand by that because there is a slight risk that "representative" sounds as if a person on the Judicial Appointments Commission would be "representative" of the community and that would be the last thing that we wanted. All we are seeking is that the Judicial Appointments Commission is not totally male or female or totally Catholic or Protestant, but has a fair or as reasonable a balance as possible.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para28"></a>Regarding the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, on district policing partnerships, I do not wish to go into detail about any such future programme of action, but it does require a root and branch inspection of the processes that lead to that type of outcome. It is nothing new. A whole range of public bodies have been doing that for 20 or 30 years&#151;seeking to uphold appointment on merit, but nevertheless inquiring into the processes which may lead to a disproportionate outcome.
<P>

<a name="40203-10_para29"></a>I hope that my reply has been helpful, and I apologise if it has been too long.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-11_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40203-11_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have debated the issue at length and wonder why the Government have changed from their position in 2002. Why should the Lord Chief Justice now be only consulted rather than have to agree with the removal or suspension of a listed judicial official? Perhaps most iniquitous of all is the fact that in the constitutional Bill the Lord Chief Justice must agree&#151;that is, for England and Wales he retains his veto. Removal in England and Wales will be by the Secretary of State with the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice. That was made clear at col. 16 of Hansard on 26 January, on page 19.74 of Constitutional Reform and in the Lord Chancellor's judiciary-related functions proposals of January 2004.
<P>

<a name="40203-11_para8"></a>The Lord Chancellor, the Minister at that time, in his Statement covered his tracks somewhat by saying:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My responsibilities also extend to Northern Ireland. Consideration will be given to the future handling of my functions that relate to the Northern Ireland judiciary. That process, which is currently under way, will include consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland and will be based on the same guiding principles as in England and Wales, taking into account any provision already made for Northern Ireland to give effect to the recommendations of the Northern Ireland Criminal Justice Review".&#151;[Official Report, 26/1/04; col. 17.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-11_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40203-11_para10"></a>This is a very important topic. In fact, nothing is more important in relation to the independence of the judiciary and the prevention of its politicisation than the right of a judge to security of tenure of office. A judge must be able to be confident that party politics will play no part in his selection and appointment and have no influence on his security of tenure. He must be unfettered in his ability to do justice to all without fear or favour, affection or ill will.
<P>

<a name="40203-11_para11"></a>The issues and the proposals in the Bill as a whole must be seen not only from the standpoint of how they will be put into effect in practice, but also how they will be perceived by the judiciary themselves. There can be little doubt that a judge in Northern Ireland will feel less secure as a result of this provision and hence less confident in showing robust independence from the powers that be.
<P>

<a name="40203-11_para12"></a>What have the Government to fear from maintaining this safeguard, which was so widely inserted when the matter was decided by Parliament less than two years ago? It must be unlikely in the extreme that the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland will refuse his consent to the dismissal of a judge following the adverse decision of a tribunal headed, as it must be, by a Law Lord unless there are very good reasons for him to do so. But by parity of reasoning, if he feels it right to withhold his consent, he will have such reasons.
<P>

<a name="40203-11_para13"></a>It may be precisely because he understands in a way which the tribunal does not that the sectarian politics of Northern Ireland, which the judiciary have been <P>


<a name="column_595"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 595</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>astute to avoid to the admiration of all fair-minded observers, has impinged on the case. It must be recognised that the Law Lord heading the tribunal may well not be&#151;indeed, probably will not be&#151;a Law Lord with deep knowledge of Northern Ireland and, unlikely as one hopes it will be, such a situation could arise. In such circumstances, the protection of the Lord Chief Justice's consent would be critical.
<P>

<a name="40203-11_para14"></a>In England and Wales, the Government's proposal&#151;the Lord Chief Justice the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, has confirmed this&#151;that the consent of the Lord Chief Justice is essential. It should be the same in Northern Ireland. What possible reason can the Government give for proposing otherwise? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   My Lords, I am so anxious to hear the answer from the Government Front Bench to the question my noble friend has posed that I hesitate to intervene. But the issue is so important that I am going to none the less.
<P>

<a name="40203-11_para15"></a>The change which Clause 5 makes is extremely important. The case for it is not made out and I believe it ought to be vigorously rejected. It is said by the Minister, "Don't worry, there will first have to be a tribunal with two judges and one lay person. One will be a Law Lord. It must have recommended removal or suspension". My answer to that is that the Lord Chief Justice does not even have to have agreed to the establishment of such a tribunal; he has only to have been consulted about it. He may have objected to it and he will not necessarily sit on it. In fact, if he has objected to it, it is almost certain that he will not sit on it.
<P>

<a name="40203-11_para16"></a>Nevertheless, as my noble friend said, under the 2002 Act, he was given a veto on removal or suspension of a judge. And that notwithstanding that the Northern Ireland Criminal Justice Review was already published so that it was known that the review,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"did not recommend a requirement for the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-11_para17"></a><P>

<a name="40203-11_para18"></a>The Explanatory Notes at paragraph 14 lamely state that the change in Clause 5 reflects more closely the recommendations in the review. Why then was it not in the 2002 Act, which succeeded the review? The answer given is that it is in the Hillsborough agreement. I suggest to your Lordships only that if it was in the Hillsborough agreement it should not have been, and the Hillsborough agreement cannot pre-empt what Parliament may decide in its wisdom.
<P>

<a name="40203-11_para19"></a>I ask noble Lords to put themselves in the position of a judge if Clause 5 is carried. Only two years ago the judge would know that he was protected by the necessity for a joint resolution of both Houses of Parliament, like his counterpart in England and Wales. Then that provision went by virtue of the 2002 Act. But still the judge could not be removed without the agreement of his chief. Now he realises that that is to go. He may be dismissed only on the recommendation of a tribunal with whose establishment his chief may have disagreed, upon which he did not sit and with whose recommendations he disagrees.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-11_para20"></a>What is the judge, in those circumstances, to make of this one-way progression of so-called reform? I offer this suggestion. He will calculate that the maintenance of a fail-safe system for judicial independence is now manifestly of less concern to the Government than that the so-called political process should be furthered by what is seen at Hillsborough to be expedient. In those circumstances, will he not be tempted to trim his sails accordingly? The very existence of such an obvious temptation, publicly perceived&#151;as it will be&#151;will serve to diminish public confidence in the independence of the judiciary. I suggest that it is not a temptation to which either the judiciary or the public should be exposed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, when we discussed the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, I offered the advice that we should not miss an opportunity to invent or slim down a judicial apparatus for Northern Ireland commensurate with the size of Northern Ireland. Parliament in its wisdom chose to ignore my advice; and we have now replicated there all the paraphernalia that we have in England and Wales. It is therefore consistent that we also follow the practice of England and Wales. For that reason, should the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, seek to test the opinion of the House, noble Lords on these Benches will support him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </B>   My Lords, I understood that it was contrary to judicial independence to alter the terms of service of a judge once he was appointed. If the proposal were to affect judges differently accordingly to the time at which they were appointed, that would be a serious and difficult situation for the judiciary in Northern Ireland to accommodate.

Moreover, paragraph 74 of the document placed in the Library by the Lord Chancellor in the light of the Government's new proposals for judicial appointments in England and Wales states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"High Court Judges and above can only be removed from office by The Queen on an Address from both Houses of Parliament. Subject to this, a judicial office-holder will only be removed from office by the Secretary of State with the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-12_para1"></a><P>

<a name="40203-12_para2"></a>Even if one sets aside the issue that Northern Ireland High Court judges will no longer enjoy the protection of a vote by both Houses of Parliament, it remains inexplicable why the additional protection of the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice should apply to all English judges, irrespective of whether they are High Court judges or circuit judges, but that equivalent <P>


<a name="column_597"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 597</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>protection should be expressly removed, for no apparent reason, in the case of newly appointed Northern Ireland High Court judges.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para3"></a>Perceptions matter enormously in decision making. If the High Court judges in Northern Ireland think that they no longer have security of tenure, it will affect the courageous independence they have shown for the past 30 years. I find the Government's conduct on the matter inexplicable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I take a different position. I understand the much greater legal knowledge of many of the noble Lords who have contributed to the debate on the amendment so far, but we are talking about a situation that is not identical to that pertaining in England and Wales. The Government gave their commitment at Hillsborough in the Joint Declaration. It would be a sad day if the Government were to renege on a promise they made to the Northern Ireland parties.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para4"></a>I understand that that is the main reason why there will be a different approach from that which noble Lords believe to be appropriate for England and Wales. Furthermore, the argument was also put in the implementation plan of the Criminal Justice Review that was updated in June 2003, when the point was clearly stated in the foreword to the document. It is not a new issue; it has been in print and understood by the main Northern Ireland political parties for some time. It would be a sad day if the House were to say, "Never mind what undertakings the Government made; we think differently". The situation in Northern Ireland, with the start of the talks today on the review of the Good Friday agreement, is sensitive. It would be unhelpful if this House were to change the Bill in the way the amendment suggests.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, any Government who make such a commitment without recognising the important repercussions ought to be big enough to say, "We gave this commitment in good faith. However, we have considered it carefully and seen what effect it will have. We are very sorry, but we have decided that we no longer intend to keep that commitment". If they are big enough as a government they can say that; and they have a duty to do so because the whole of Northern Ireland justice depends on retaining the confidence and power of the judges.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, it was not my intention to intervene&#151;not because I am not party to this amendment but because there are those who are judicially qualified to speak on the matter and, as a layman, I feel that I am not. However, that was until the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, raised the issue of Hillsborough yet again. I always understood during my period both in another place and here that Parliament was supreme and that no politician, even the Secretary of State, could arbitrarily usurp its authority.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para5"></a>In this case, we are dealing with something that has a long proven tradition. It is totally wrong to make such a change to please some small element of society in Northern Ireland, whatever the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, may think. Hence I support the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and hope that he will press the matter to a Division.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, it may horrify your Lordships to know that the magic words "Hillsborough" and "Weston Park" could in any way justify the change in legislation brought forward by the Government. I shall take Weston Park first. We were told in this building&#151;many noble Lords will remember the occasion&#151;that these very serious changes were authorised at Weston Park.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para6"></a>A Minister of the Crown was present who is now unfortunately deceased. He repeated to me that one could not argue with him because the matter was carried and arranged at Weston Park. I said that I was sorry, but there was no such thing as "the Weston Park agreement". I apologise to your Lordships, because this may seem removed from Hillsborough, but the pattern is exactly the same.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para7"></a>The deceased very senior Lord on that occasion said that he was sorry but I was not up to date because the matter was agreed at Weston Park. My noble friend Lord Maginnis was present at the gathering in Weston Park. There was never at any stage in the proceedings a get-together around any table; there was never a vote taken. What happened was that the two Prime Ministers consulted with various groups and parties when it suited them. The others, I suppose, went around feeding the ducks, but at no time was there a legal gathering and at no time were decisions taken.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para8"></a>The late Lord telephoned me the next morning and said, "Jim, I owe you an apology. You were correct. There was no agreement because there never was any sort of an Assembly. When I left you last night, I went over to No. 10 and asked to see a copy of the Weston Park agreement. There was confusion in that building&#151;I shall not say anything about more recent confusions&#151;and, in the end, a very senior official said, 'I'm sorry. We don't have it. We can't have it. No one has it because there was not an agreement'".
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para9"></a>Much the same operation continued at Hillsborough. Others were present&#151;I was not in the magic circle. On that occasion, we were blessed with the presence of the President of the United States. However, as I understand it, there was a fair amount of drama with television statements and so on, but no concrete, definite legal agreement. Therefore, I am afraid that I have a duty to issue this caution lest we blunder into accepting as the law something which was never put in place by any democratic body.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I believe that this is the most important and challenging issue that we shall debate on this Bill. First, this measure is superfluous in practice. I shall seek to explain that I cannot conceive of circumstances in which a Lord Chief Justice would wish to oppose a decision of a properly constituted tribunal.
<P>


<a name="column_599"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 599</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para10"></a>Secondly, I shall seek to set this issue within the reality of our considerations&#151;the reality of the challenge facing this Government and civil society in Northern Ireland&#151;on how to build on normalisation and work towards devolution. As part of that, it is clearly important that we honour our commitments if we are to expect others to do so also. The commitment given as part of the Hillsborough agreement is reasonable and it does not undermine judicial security or judicial independence. I shall speak on those two issues.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para11"></a>I turn to why there is no reason to believe that the processes that will come into force post-devolution&#151;we are talking about post-devolution here&#151;will not put the independence of the judiciary at risk or cause a problem to the Lord Chief Justice. There are three categories of judicial office-holder. I must ask for the patience of the House in this respect as I want to explain how these measures will apply to the three categories of those office-holders.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para12"></a>First, Section 7(5) of the 2002 Act&#151;the section that we are talking about&#151;will not apply to the removal of the Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal; nor will it apply to a High Court judge appointed before the section comes into force, which would be post-devolution of judicial functions. The removal of those office-holders, were they to be found guilty of a judicial misconduct, would require not only the recommendation of a removal tribunal but also an address to both Houses of Parliament. Therefore, this amendment does not refer at all to that category of judicial office-holder.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para13"></a>I turn to the second clutch of judicial office-holders, if I may use that term. I refer to all other listed judicial office-holders, as set out in Schedule 1 to the 2002 Act; for example, as the 2002 Act currently stands, the removal of one of the 17 county court judges or one of the 19 resident magistrates would require the consent of the Lord Chief Justice.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para14"></a>However, as a consequence of this Bill, a tribunal would be established, as was said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, either at the initiation of the Lord Chief Justice himself or at the initiation of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice. The tribunal that would be set up for this category of judicial office-holder would be chaired by the Lord Chief Justice himself, a former Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal. It would also have a High Court judge member. The crucial point in this respect is that the chair and the High Court judge will be selected by the Lord Chief Justice. Therefore, for this clutch of judicial office-holders, which is by far the vast majority&#151;roughly speaking, we are talking about some 1,000 posts&#151;the Lord Chief Justice will select the High Court judge and the Lord Chief Justice, if he wishes, can put himself on the tribunal and can chair it.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para15"></a>A third&#151;lay&#151;member will be selected by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Therefore, if, for some reason, one chose to believe that the lay member was nothing other than a patsy or a pawn of politicians, two senior judges would clearly form the <P>


<a name="column_600"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 600</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>majority of such a tribunal. One of those would be the Lord Chief Justice, if he wished to chair it; the other would be a High Court judge whom he would have chosen to sit with him on that panel.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para16"></a>Next, the tribunal's procedure will be determined by no other than the Lord Chief Justice himself. In those circumstances, I cannot see how it is conceivable that a tribunal so composed with such a procedure could come forward with a recommendation with which the Lord Chief Justice would not be in accord.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para17"></a>The third set of judicial office-holders&#151;High Court judges&#151;are potentially the smallest group and form potentially the most sensitive and challenging area. As I believe the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, signalled, the measure would apply only to a High Court judge appointed post-devolution, not prior to it, but a High Court judge appointed after the new removal provisions come into force. And, were such a High Court judge to be charged with a misdemeanour which appeared either to the Lord Chief Justice or to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister acting together to require investigation, the process would be as follows.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para18"></a>A tribunal would have to be convened and it would be chaired by a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary&#151;we know who those are&#151;or the holder of a high judicial office. That could mean an English High Court, Court of Appeal or Court of Session judge. The other judicial member would be a judge of the Court of Appeal in England and Wales or a judge of the Inner House of the Court of Session. Those persons would be selected by the Lord Chancellor.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para19"></a>Also, if such a distinguished tribunal recommended the removal of a High Court judge, then it seems to me inconceivable that a body consisting of those people and making such a momentous recommendation would do so without the greatest inspection of the evidence and the greatest inspection of whether they believed it was fair, right and proper to do so.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para20"></a>Therefore, two of the highest judicial office-holders in the land would make a recommendation that a judge&#151;in this category, a High Court judge&#151;be removed. Can we conceive of a situation where the Lord Chief Justice would consider it right to say in that circumstance, "No, I will have my way. The decision of that tribunal should not carry"? In the difficult circumstances of Northern Ireland, in essence we are saying that no person, however high or low, can appoint a judge and no person can veto a judge.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para21"></a>Lastly, I turn to why this matters and why I particularly hope that the arrangements which we have always enjoyed in this House of a bi-partisan approach to the crucial issues of Northern Ireland will sustain and continue. I do not need to tell the House what a deeply divided society it is and how previous governments have been struggling for years with the parties in Northern Ireland to try to bring an end to the appalling divisions in that society. Many Members of this House know vastly more about that than I do, but I mark that we have not concluded that process at this stage.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para22"></a>In fact, the Northern Ireland parties have gathered today to begin a review of the operation of the Belfast agreement. I, and I am sure all Members of the House, <P>


<a name="column_601"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 601</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hope that that will lead to a successful outcome. The Government will work with the parties to try to create the conditions which will enable a working executive to be formed. But what is needed is confidence between the parties and among the public. Everyone must live up to the commitments which they have given. How do we expect other political parties to honour their difficult commitments if the Government themselves do not honour theirs?
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para23"></a>The proposals contained in the Bill were the subject of extensive discussion at Hillsborough to try to ensure the broadest possible support. We have been completely transparent about these commitments. The Joint Declaration by the UK and the Irish Governments in May last year set out the Hillsborough discussion. This declaration confirmed that there would be a second justice Bill and the nine specific commitments were made public in the up-dated implementation plan. One of those is Clause 5 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para24"></a>There has been a great tradition in this House of co-operation across the parties on matters affecting the political process in Northern Ireland. I very much hope and expect that we will continue that tradition because the greater good of Northern Ireland and peace require that. I am worried by what I have already heard in terms of the signals and soundings that have been given by both Opposition Benches in that respect.
<P>

<a name="40203-12_para25"></a>In conclusion, a clear, transparent process for both the appointment and the appropriate removal of judicial office holders is set out in this Bill, which I believe is both fair to the person complained against and to society. No one acting alone would be able to appoint, dismiss or veto a judge. That is right. These are carefully crafted measures which increase transparency in judicial independence. I believe that the House should support them. I call on it to do so.

<A NAME="40203-12_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, can he explain to me, as a total ignoramus on this topic, what appears to be a total dichotomy between his two opening sentences? First, he said that it will make no difference because he cannot conceive of any circumstance in which the Lord Chief Justice would disagree with the tribunal. Secondly, he said that it is a very important provision of the Hillsborough agreement, which we must not tear up. If it is totally unimportant and there is never going to be any choice, why did people make so much fuss to make it a term of the Hillsborough agreement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the Government did not make so much fuss to get it into the Hillsborough agreement. It was very important indeed to some of the parties. There is absolutely no contradiction between the two points I have been making.
<P>

<a name="40203-13_para0"></a>I shall explain why. Northern Ireland is such a divided society and the Lord Chief Justices I have met in Northern Ireland&#151;and that is two only&#151;will be aware of the great courage and integrity which Lord Chief Justices have displayed in the appallingly <P>


<a name="column_602"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 602</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difficult times in Northern Ireland over the years. I believe that the vast majority of the people of Northern Ireland have respect for Lord Chief Justices both past and present. But because it is such a divided society, some political parties might be apprehensive that a future Lord Chief Justice with a power of veto might exercise it in the face of a decision, which was not fair and balanced, by a properly constituted tribunal. I believe that that concern may be seen by some as extreme but it is a real issue. Therefore, because there is no threat to judicial independence in practice, as I have explained, it is important that the Government honour their commitments in that respect. It is part of building confidence in the wider part of civil society in Northern Ireland in the integrity of the judicial processes there. I commend it to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his lengthy expose of the Government's position. I am not convinced. Some of the contradictions which have appeared make me even more convinced that there is absolutely no need for this clause and that the Bill would be considerably better without it. I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<a name="40203-13_para3"></a>Clause 6 [Duty of Director of Public Prosecutions to refer certain matters to Police Ombudsman]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass </B>   moved Amendment No. 14:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 35, leave out "may have" and insert "has"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-13_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40203-13_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment deals with the duty of the Director of Public Prosecutions to refer certain matters to the Police Ombudsman. I particularly refer to subsection (3), which will insert a new subsection (4A) in to the 1955 Act:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Director shall refer to the Ombudsman any matter which&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-13_para6"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) appears to the Director to indicate that a police officer&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-13_para7"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(i) may have committed a criminal offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-13_para8"></a>
It is our proposal that "may have" be changed to "has".
<P>

<a name="40203-13_para9"></a>It appears absolutely ridiculous that the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has the duty to make decisions about matters being referred to the court, should have to relegate his position to that of the Police Ombudsman. That is what it boils down to.
<P>

<a name="40203-13_para10"></a>The reality is that the Director of Public Prosecutions will look at a case where there has been an allegation that a police officer may have committed a criminal offence and he will then make a decision that he has enough evidence to test the matter in court, or that he does not have enough evidence and that the matter should not be tested in court. That has to be an <P>


<a name="column_605"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 605</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>end of it. It appears to go against the course of natural justice that the matter would then be passed on to the Police Ombudsman for further investigation.
<P>

<a name="40203-13_para11"></a>Recently the Police Ombudsman went back in one case for a period of 10 years where a complaint had been made by an injured party. He decided to reopen a matter that had previously been referred to the DPP and where no action had been taken. When I questioned that, I was told that where a matter appears to have involved criminality, the ombudsman has an obligation to deal with it no matter how far back the issue goes.
<P>

<a name="40203-13_para12"></a>When the legislation creating the post of Police Ombudsman was passed through Parliament, I understood that there was to be no retrospection. Now I am told that that is in respect of policy, not matters of criminality. So, at present if someone takes an allegation to the Police Ombudsman, she considers that it is her legal obligation to pursue the issue. However, I do not believe that this House should endorse legislation which states not only that, but that the Director of Public Prosecutions, irrespective of any decision he makes within the powers of his office, has to subject himself to second-guessing by the Police Ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="40203-13_para13"></a>For that reason, I propose that in line 35 we leave out "may have" and insert "has". Amendment No. 15, grouped with this amendment, leaves out lines 36 to 38, which state that a police officer,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may, in the course of a criminal investigation, have behaved in a manner which would justify disciplinary proceedings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-13_para14"></a>
That is so ill-defined that, again, I believe that it should not be part of the Bill. We have a Chief Constable and a police board, and disciplinary procedures are already in place. Once again, it appears that we are saying that the Chief Constable and officers in command of the PSNI must subjugate themselves to the will and interests of the Police Ombudsman. Again, it strikes me as an absolute travesty that that should be the case.
<P>

<a name="40203-13_para15"></a>In the debate on Clause 5 it was interesting to hear the Minister virtually admit, and to receive support from his noble friend Lord Dubs, that concessions were being made to a very small minority&#151;we all know that we are talking about Sinn Fein. Those cannot be deemed to be in the best interests of the community: Protestant or Catholic, Unionist or Nationalist, where neither has any difficulty at present. We are being asked to accept an intervention by Sinn Fein for some narrow nationalistic or sectarian reason. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-14_spmin0"></A><B> The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith):</B>  My Lords, we discussed this clause at some length in Committee. The amendments deal with the reference by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the Police Ombudsman in certain cases.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para0"></a>I re-emphasise what I said in Committee; that is, this clause does not undermine in any way the professionalism of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Perhaps I may respond straightaway to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, that the effect of this <P>


<a name="column_606"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 606</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clause may be that the director is delegating in some way his decision to the ombudsman. Clearly, that is not the position. As I said in Committee, decisions as to whether there should be a prosecution will still lie entirely with the director and his staff. It is his decision as to whether a prosecution should take place, and that will continue to be the position. If there is to be a prosecution, that will take place before reference to the ombudsman. So, there is no question of delegating a decision. The point is that the ombudsman has a different function. The ombudsman is not concerned to make a decision as to whether there should be a prosecution. As I said, that is for the director. The issue for the ombudsman is a different one and not one which falls within the director's responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para1"></a>The provision therefore delineates sensibly the respective roles of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Police Ombudsman by ensuring that any decision taken on the conduct of the police&#151;not prosecution decisions but other decisions&#151;are taken by the Police Ombudsman as Parliament intended. The director may already make reference to the Police Ombudsman in these circumstances, and we are strengthening that provision.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para2"></a>If Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 took effect, that would mean that the director would be obliged to refer cases to the ombudsman only where a police officer had in fact committed a crime. In effect, that means only where the officer has been convicted of a crime. In our view, that is a much narrower and less helpful provision than ensuring that the ombudsman is in a position to know of cases where there may be a justification for considering, as the ombudsman may, other powers rather than prosecution.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para3"></a>The other aspect to which the noble Lord referred is the second part of the clause, which his amendment would remove. That relates to cases where it appears to the director that a police officer,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may, in the course of a criminal investigation, have behaved in a manner which would justify disciplinary proceedings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-14_para4"></a>
The noble Lord worries about that being ill-defined. However, the virtue of the clause is that it is not for the director to decide whether disciplinary proceedings should take place. Ultimately, that is a matter for the ombudsman. He is simply making a reference to matters which may fall within that category. He and his staff will need to be guided&#151;I have discussed this with the director&#151;as to the kind of areas that may cover. However, as I have said, in view of the great experience of the director and his staff in dealing with police investigations, they will certainly have a good idea of conduct which may justify disciplinary proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para5"></a>Finally, the noble Lord referred to the issue of retrospectivity. We dealt with that also in Committee. We tabled amendments then, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Laird, who drew this to our attention, to ensure that this clause is consistent with the existing legislation in terms of retrospective investigations by the ombudsman. There are certain circumstances in which, within limits, it may be retrospective. This clause makes no changes to those <P>


<a name="column_607"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 607</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and is entirely consistent with them. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord does not press his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, it is difficult to convince me. Certainly, I have not found the Minister's response convincing. It appears that there is a form of double jeopardy that has not been addressed. It is left to me to ask whether the Minister can illustrate a case in which, a criminal having gone through the due process, someone who is not a police officer will find himself in a similar situation to a police officer as here proposed. If the Minister can give me an example of that, I will be happy to give way. It is not my intention to press this, but it is disappointing that the Government are simply putting this provision in the Bill to placate a small section of society, namely Sinn Fein/IRA.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, once we reach Report, and the Minister has sat down, only the mover of the amendment may speak. Technically, the mover of the amendment must move the amendment in order to say anything. The House is slightly lenient on that point. The Minister listens and obviously if appropriate, will drop a line or two to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para7"></a>[Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 not moved.]
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para8"></a>Clause 7 [Influencing a prosecutor]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glentoran </B>   moved Amendment No. 17:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 7.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-14_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40203-14_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: At Committee stage, I thought that we had support from all around the House. I had hoped&#151;perhaps expected would be overstating it&#151;that the Government might have seen a way to leaving this clause out and taking our advice that it was unnecessary, especially in the light of my reading of Hansard, where I found the Attorney-General's arguments less than convincing. I have great admiration for the Attorney-General in 99.9 per cent of what he does for our nation.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para11"></a>This is a new offence of influencing a prosecutor. It is neither necessary nor wise. The Government rightly realised that, for it to have legal certainty, an essential of any such criminal offence is that it must be done with the intention of perverting the course of justice. Any attempt to influence a prosecutor with such an intent is already a criminal offence at common law, and the proposed statutory offence adds nothing to it. I am well advised by my noble friends who are not in their places at the moment, but who are much more skilful lawyers than me.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para12"></a>The Attorney-General was asked specifically by my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern to illustrate circumstances in which there would be a breach of the clause and yet not of the common law provisions. I sensed from Hansard that he was not able <P>


<a name="column_608"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 608</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to answer that. He said that there was an advantage in having it in the statute. The real problem is that while to do so adds nothing in law, it has a significant down side. As the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General made clear, reference to the "Director of Public Prosecutions" refers also to his deputy, to any public prosecutor, and to any barrister or solicitor appointed to prosecute on his behalf. Yet, there can be many perfectly valid reasons why individuals can and should be able to seek to influence the prosecutor, be it the DPP himself or any other prosecutor.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para13"></a>Such representations may concern not only the evidence, but the public interest reasons for bringing the case. Before any case can be prosecuted not only should there be a sufficiency of evidence to give a reasonable prospect of conviction, but prosecution must also be in the public interest. The existence of this new offence is unlikely to have much effect on professional criminals or terrorists, or on those who intimidate on their behalf. It may well inhibit the innocent person who wishes to make a pressing representation, whether it be on evidential or public interest grounds. It is essential that the law be clear in this area. We suggest that this clause reduces clarity and may well restrict proper representations. It should not stand part of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   My Lords, this clause is a mystery. It is a harmful mystery because, as my noble friend has just said, common law achieves everything, on a more general basis, that this achieves in a particular focus. It is harmful, because the existence of this specific offence will be a temptation and will lead to the foreseeable use by prosecutors of this specific offence. This has harmful connotations for exactly the reason that my noble friend has just given.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para14"></a>He said correctly, as the Attorney-General knows so well, that there are two limbs to what a prosecutor must ask himself. Is there enough evidence to justify a conviction on the basis that there will be a reasonable chance of getting a conviction? That is how it is put in Northern Ireland, if I remember correctly&#151;it is either reasonable or realistic, but I believe that it is reasonable; the effect is the same either way.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para15"></a>Is a prosecution in the public interest? That is the second limb, which applies if the first question has been answered in the affirmative. Why should a member of the public not have a view as to what is or is not in the public interest? It is entirely foreseeable that a member of the public will have a view on any particular case, and he may be moved to express it to the prosecuting authorities. Why should he not seek to influence a prosecuting authority in those circumstances? There can be no reason whatever why he should not be permitted to seek to do so, and foreseeably he will.
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para16"></a>What can be more readily foreseeable than that a prosecutor in such circumstances will say to himself, "This is intended to pervert the course of justice by an interference with my impartial discretion"? It will be for the prosecutor to decide whether to prosecute the member of the public for that offence.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-14_para17"></a>I invite your Lordships to accept that this clause is unnecessary, and it will give rise to confusing uncertainty. It will result in inexpedient criminal proceedings, and at worst it may well lead to an oppressive prosecution. This clause should be struck from the Bill, and I hope that it will be.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I will give the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General a practical example of a case in which I might well have been deemed&#151;if this clause became legislation&#151;to have committed an offence.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para0"></a>An elderly widow was accused of being involved in a hit and run accident about 30 miles from her home on a Saturday morning. She was taken to court, the case had been adjourned, and she was going back to court. Knowing the family and knowing that the woman would not be involved in such a case, I went to see her. I discovered that the police had come out, they had seen a dinge in her car, which had happened before&#151;she had had the car for years. The police had taken paint samples, but they had not given her a report of what those samples indicated.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para1"></a>I intervened on her behalf. I discovered that the paint samples proved nothing. I approached the chief superintendent, and I suggested that he had no case and should not prosecute. He insisted that he would prosecute, because he had an eyewitness. I had the idea of getting her telephone account. She lived on her own, and I discovered that at the very time that she was supposed to be 30 miles away bashing into the car, she had made a series of telephone calls to people who could be identified as members of the bowling club where she was secretary and of the Mothers' Union where she was secretary.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para2"></a>The case still went to court, despite my making representations and presenting that evidence. I had to go to court and give evidence. Eventually, the resident magistrate understood and dismissed the case, realising that the eyewitness had made a mistake. Given that series of events, would I have been guilty of an offence under this Bill? I believe that I would have, because I pleaded with the chief superintendent not to pursue the case against the woman. If the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General can convince me that I am wrong in that opinion, I might better understand the purpose of duplicating the provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, put his proposition on the basis that having the offence was neither necessary nor wise. In my view, it is both, and I will explain why. Before I do, I shall emphasise two factual points of importance. The first is that, in some of the observations made by noble Lords, the spectre was raised of a prosecutor misusing the clause to the detriment of those who have perfectly legitimate reasons to put representations before him. The two points relate to that.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para3"></a>First, there is no offence, unless the intention of the person seeking to influence the Director of Public Prosecutions is to pervert the course of justice. That is <P>


<a name="column_610"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 610</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>critical. It is not an offence of seeking to influence; it is an offence if there is an intention to pervert the course of justice. I have no hesitation in saying to the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass, that, on the account that he gave of the proper steps that he took on behalf of a constituent so that the course of justice would run true, rather than be perverted, he did not commit any offence and would not commit an offence on any further occasion. I hope that the noble Lord, who said that he hoped to be convinced by me, will, at least, find that statement by me of some comfort, even if he is not prepared to be wholly convinced, as I hope he will be. It is important to recognise that the provision requires that absolutely key condition.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para4"></a>The second point&#151;it is not unimportant&#151;is that Section 32A(4) will provide that the proceedings cannot be brought just on the whim of a prosecutor, a barrister or a solicitor. They can be brought only with the consent of the director. It will take a decision by the director for such proceedings to be brought. They cannot be brought on a whim or so as to frighten someone off.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para5"></a>Why is the provision necessary and wise? A new system of justice is being created for all the people of Northern Ireland. Under that system, the director will explicitly be an independent officer. That is unlike the position in England and Wales, although I do not suggest for a moment that the Director of Public Prosecutions in England and Wales is not independent. The position will be different in that there will be a wholly new relationship with the Law Officers.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para6"></a>At the moment, the Director of Public Prosecutions is subject to the superintendence of the Attorney-General&#151;my superintendence. After the devolution of justice, that relationship will change, and the director will be in a more direct and, if I may say so, free-standing position. He will have a relationship of consultation with the new locally appointed Attorney-General and a relationship of consultation with the Advocate-General. The reason for that is to make it very clear, in the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, that people must have absolute confidence that prosecution decisions taken in Northern Ireland are taken independently, impartially and objectively on the evidence and nothing else and, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, and the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, on a proper consideration of the public interest. Those of us who have to make those decisions know that it is a question of public interest and not, for example, of any party political interest, which would be an inadmissible consideration.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para7"></a>Everyone needs to be clear that those decisions will be taken independently. In the past, there have been assertions&#151;assertions that I have repudiated and repudiate now&#151;that prosecution decisions have not been taken on that basis. I unreservedly pay tribute to the present and past director for the independence of the decisions that they have taken. Those decisions were taken conscientiously and properly, but I know for a fact that people have questioned them. Therefore, it is important and necessary for Parliament to express very clearly that the independence of the director is <P>


<a name="column_611"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 611</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>absolute and that anybody who seeks to influence him with the intention of perverting the course of justice shall not do so. It is necessary so that there is a clear statement, and it is necessary so that the people of Northern Ireland can be assured that decisions affecting them, their family, their relatives or their neighbours will be taken properly, objectively and impartially. It is necessary to state that to give that assurance and, as I said, to give a clear statement that the independence is to be respected.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para8"></a>I have declined to speculate on all the circumstances in which the common law might afford a remedy at the moment. As I said to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, in Committee, the difficulty about the common law is, as he and all lawyers will know, that its edges are often not that precisely clear, until a court gives further clarity. By putting this provision in the statute, we will make it clear that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if, with the intention of perverting the course of justice, he seeks to influence the Director"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-15_para9"></a>
or one of those persons, a person is guilty of an offence.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para10"></a>It may be that, in certain circumstances, the common law could have done the job, but it is better that what we expect from people should be clear in the statute. I have made it clear in what I have said to the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass, and on a previous occasion, that the provision will not stop proper representations being made by people who, to put it broadly, have a legitimate interest in doing so&#151;there will be many&#151;to the prosecutors. However, there comes a point at which it crosses the boundary into seeking to pervert the course of justice, and that shall not be done. It is both necessary to say it&#151;to give assurance&#151;and wise to say it, in order that there should be a very clear message in the statute about the independence of the director. Those are the reasons why I continue to believe that it is an important and proper provision.

<P>

<a name="40203-15_para15"></a>In Committee, the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Kingsland, tabled an amendment relating to that issue. In response, my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General stated that it was the Government's intention to adopt the committee's recommendations but that time had not permitted amendments to be tabled for the Committee stage.
<P>

<a name="40203-15_para16"></a>The amendments in this group amend Clauses 8 and 21 to make provision for the Attorney-General's guidance on human rights that will be brought into force by order, subject to the negative resolution procedure when it is issued and each time it is revised.

<a name="40203-15_para17"></a>I thank the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee for its advice. I beg to move.

Having spoken to the noble Baroness, the chief constable's office at the PSNI and officials, I understand that while the Government are unwilling to alter the Bill to include this amendment, or a similar one, they are giving serious consideration to how such an amendment could be brought into future Bills on Northern Ireland justice, which we are led to believe are in the pipeline. I understand that the amendment could cause difficulties with the ECHR. I accept those arguments and should be grateful if the noble Baroness could give me an undertaking today that the Government are <P>


<a name="column_613"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 613</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>considering the matter and intend to facilitate the PSNI and those concerned with enforcing law and order in this area. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, proposed a similar amendment in Committee. I gave an undertaking then to consider the proposal in so far as it related to a breach of bail. I have written to the noble Lord and, with the leave of the House, I shall set out what I said in that letter to clarify matters. Before doing so, it would be helpful to set out the powers that are currently available.
<P>

<a name="40203-16_para11"></a>At present, the police have an automatic power of entry to effect arrest when an arrestable offence, as defined in the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, has been committed, is being committed, or is about to be committed. The power also applies for the purpose of saving life or limb, or for preventing serious damage to property, where a court issues a warrant of arrest in criminal proceedings and in a number of other specified instances.
<P>

<a name="40203-16_para12"></a>In bail cases police powers are already in place to deal with the most serious breaches. When a person absconds from bail, committing the offence of failing to surrender to custody, the court would issue a warrant of arrest on his non-appearance, and thus a power of entry would follow. If a breach of a bail condition is of a serious nature, it may well constitute an arrestable offence&#151;for example, the intimidation of witnesses&#151;and thus, again a power of arrest and entry already exists.
<P>

<a name="40203-16_para13"></a>It is only in relation to the less serious breaches and anticipated breaches, which do not constitute criminal offences, that a power of entry is not presently available. I would have real concerns that to create a power of entry for police in those less serious scenarios might be disproportionate and incompatible with the ECHR, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran.
<P>

<a name="40203-16_para14"></a>Since the Committee stage, my officials have been working closely with the chief constable's staff in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. They have been exploring the need to create a power of entry, proportionality and ECHR compliance. It is our view, which is now shared with the PSNI, that more joint work needs to be done between policy and legal staff.
<P>

<a name="40203-16_para15"></a>Against the backdrop of the availability of other powers of entry, the pressing need for such a power in the circumstances proposed needs to be fully explored. Providing such a power should not be done lightly. It would be preferable to consider the power of entry in the context of all other related issues, including other powers in relation to arrest and bail.
<P>

<a name="40203-16_para16"></a>I intimated in Committee that the need for a power of entry could be looked at in the context of the planned review of PACE in Northern Ireland. We have now agreed a revised way forward with PSNI whereby we shall fully explore the detail and prioritise the issue ahead of the planned PACE review. If legislation is still required, a legislative vehicle will be found.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-16_para21"></a>The noble Baroness said: The main effect of the amendment is to provide that all transfers under the new power will be on a restricted basis and that, accordingly, the prisoner's release date will not be effected by the transfer. I said in Committee that any transfers would be on a restricted basis to ensure that there was no possibility of the prisoner benefiting from it owing to the more generous early release arrangements available in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40203-16_para22"></a>We reflected on the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, in Committee, and concluded that it is right that the fact that all transfers will be on a restricted basis should appear on the face of the Bill. The amendment also provides that it will not be possible to convert a transfer from being on a restricted basis to an unrestricted basis. The amendment mirrors existing provisions of Schedule 1 to the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 by providing that any transfer under the new power may be subject to such other conditions, if any, as the Secretary of State may think fit to impose. Those additional conditions will be capable of being varied or removed at any time.

<a name="40203-16_para27"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am unsure how to handle this amendment. Part of the response to Amendment No. 27 was given earlier today by the noble Lord, Lord Filkin. I have also received a letter from the Lord President on this topic which almost satisfies me. It certainly clarifies issues about which I was concerned. Alongside the explanations given by the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, to earlier amendments today, it clears up the matter.
<P>

<a name="40203-16_para28"></a>I have one concern: that this Bill will not run concurrently with the constitution Bill because I do not believe that it has yet been printed. A number of issues in this Bill could change fairly dramatically should the constitution of England and Wales Bill be altered significantly on its passage through Parliament. I was anxious to find a vehicle through which we could return to this Bill, or to parts of it, even though it had been enacted, so that we could change certain points should the constitution Bill be significantly altered. I want to avoid a widening gulf of differentials on particular aspects of the Bill, most of which we have talked about in Committee and on Report at some length. I do not know how to do that. I tabled this amendment as an opportunity to open the debate for probably the last time. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40203-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, when we discussed this matter in Committee I anticipated some overlap between the two Bills being considered by the two Houses of Parliament.

<P>

<a name="40203-17_para0"></a>As I said in Committee on Clauses 1 to 3, which relate to the Judicial Appointments Commission, the practical steps to create a commission should not be rushed and will take time. We aim to have the commission in place by spring 2005, so there is some time available to us. Clauses 4 and 5 come into effect only after the devolution of criminal justice. I hope that in the light of that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="40203-17_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I expect to be told that the amendment is in conflict with the European Court ruling, but I do not believe that it is. In aid of that view I shall quote the finding of the court which the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, mentioned on 13 January in Grand Committee:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'The court had found under Article 8 of the Convention that a test of congruent biological factors could no longer be decisive in denying legal recognition to the change of gender of a post-operative transsexual'".&#151;[Official Report, 13/1/04; col. GC 5.]

<FONT SIZE=3>
I believe that those last words are the most important.
<P>

<a name="40203-17_para19"></a>The amendment states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Gender Recognition Act 2004, no two persons each possessing XX chromosomes nor each possessing XY chromosomes, nor each possessing genitalia appropriate to the same sex, may be married the one to the other".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-17_para20"></a>
It is slightly badly drafted and it would be better if it said, "and each possessing genitalia". I leave that to one side.
<P>

<a name="40203-17_para21"></a>Last week on 29 January, during the first day of Report stage, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, set out in commendably robust and clear terms the policy of the Government:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are not going to allow same-sex marriage; I said that very clearly at Second Reading and that is our position".&#151;[Official Report, 29/1/04; col. 401.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-17_para22"></a>
One may believe that the noble Lord would welcome an amendment that would prohibit marriage between persons of the same sex. That is a marriage between persons whose chromosomes and sexual organs are of the same sex. After all, that is the undoubted determinant of biological sex. I know that some people think that one's sex is determined by one's mind, but that is surely no more than a superstition.
<P>

<a name="40203-17_para23"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will acquit me of discourtesy&#151;I am sure he will&#151;if I say that his robust rejection of same-sex marriage does not go so far as rejection of same-sex marriage. In his answer to a Written Question on 19 January he set out his position more openly. I asked Her Majesty's Government,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Whether they intend to legalise marriage between persons each possessing the XX chromosome (or each possessing the XY chromosome) and each possessing the genitalia of the same sex.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-17_para24"></a>
The noble Lord replied:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government believe that marriage should only be possible between people of opposite gender in law".&#151;[Official Report, 19/1/04; col. WA 124.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-17_para25"></a>
There we have the problem. The Government believe that marriage should only be possible between people of opposite gender in law. I believe that it should only be possible between people of opposite sex.
<P>

<a name="40203-17_para26"></a>The noble Lord may yet have to eat some of his words. The other day I was reading my birth certificate. I have brought it into the Chamber this evening. I know that Government Whips suspect that I might not have had one, but here is the document. At the bottom, I found something that I had never noticed before. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Caution. Any person who (1) falsifies any of the particulars on this certificate, or (2) uses it as true, knowing it to be false, is liable to prosecution under the Forgery Act 1913 or the Perjury Act 1911".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-17_para27"></a>
I presume that if I were to be overtaken by sexual dysphoria and became possessed of the idea that I was indeed a woman, and secured the agreement of a gender recognition panel to that, I would receive a new certificate. However, it would be in conflict, quite clearly, with the Forgery Act 1913 or the Perjury Act 1911, in that it would state, contrary to this certificate, that I had been born as a female. We do get into deep water in these matters, do we not?

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-17_para28"></a>Let us consider the Minister's proposition from the Written Answer to the Parliamentary Question that I have just recounted. His answer would mean that two persons, each of whom had given birth to children&#151;and I can think of no better test of whether a person is female than that&#151;and each of whom remains capable of bearing children, could be legally married provided that one has been given a certificate that states that she was born a male, was a male at the time she gave birth, and remained a male. That is the implication&#151;nay, the meaning&#151;of the Minister's reply. What would the noble Lord think should appear on their child's birth certificate; that his mother was a man? For sure, that would have to appear on it.
<P>

<a name="40203-17_para29"></a>Let me remind the Minister of his Written Answer to another Parliamentary Question of mine on 19 January. I asked the Government whether they were,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"aware of any cases of persons certified at birth as male who had given birth to children".&#151;[Official Report, 19/1/04; col. WA 125.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-17_para30"></a>
I have just enunciated the circumstance where somebody who had been certified as male at birth could give birth to children. Will any such caveat as appeared on my birth certificate appear on those issued under the Bill?
<P>

<a name="40203-17_para31"></a>What of the marriage so disrupted by the person who purports to be the husband and who then gives birth? Would such an event establish in the minds of the noble Lord's legal advisers that it was a same-sex marriage? Would that marriage fall to be annulled under the dictum of the Minister as enunciated in his response last week to Amendment No. 28; that is, that a marriage between persons of the same sex should be annulled? Or would the noble Lord's advisers shrug their shoulders and say, "Well, it's just one of those things, isn't it? People giving birth these days might well be women; they might well be men. Anyway, so long as they are legally female, all is well".
<P>

<a name="40203-17_para32"></a>Even at this late stage, I beg the Government to see the world as it is. There is something absurd in the proposition that the problems&#151;I accept that they are very real ones&#151;of transsexual people require us to accept that while today the marriage of two people each bearing the chromosomes and the sexual organs of the same sex would be a same-sex marriage and therefore illegal, a piece of paper that declares one of those two people to be of the opposite sex would be permitted by this legislation to make it a legal marriage of opposite sexes. That cannot make sense. I beg the noble Lord to consider that matter and to accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40203-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Turnberg: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I do have a problem with the amendment. A problem arises from the attempt to base so much on the possession of the X and Y chromosomes and on the external genitalia, not least because there are so many exceptions to the general rule that one can determine a person's sex by them. One example is the condition known as Turner's syndrome, which affects women, most of whom have only one X chromosome. Is one X enough to count as a woman? Those who have Turner's syndrome certainly are women. Another is Klinefelter's syndrome, which affects men who have two Xs and a Y. Should they be classified <P>


<a name="column_619"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 619</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as men or women? They believe that they are men, but they have two Xs. Genes on other chromosomes also contribute to the sexuality of a person.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para0"></a>One comes then to the possession of the relevant genitalia as the determining factor. However, there are many examples of babies born with genitalia that are at variance with their chromosomes. Some of those babies have had some form of surgery that placed them clearly and permanently in one or other gender. Only in some cases do those genders coincide with their chromosomes. Some of those people have married on reaching adulthood. Those couples are of course infertile as, unfortunately, are many other couples, but infertility was never a bar to marriage. However, the amendment would prevent their marriage on the chromosomal count.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para1"></a>All of the above says nothing of the rights of transsexual people to marry, which the Bill would allow, but it simply points out the difficulties in practice of using the criteria that are set out in the amendment. I cannot support it.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, I reluctantly join the debate at this stage of the Bill. I apologise for not being in the House at Second Reading and for hearing only part of the Committee stage. However, I feel so strongly about the amendment, as well as about Amendment No. 128, that it is important to put on record the medical facts.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para2"></a>As a practising obstetrician and gynaecologist who has been involved with reproductive medicine and the definition of sex in both animals and humans for the past 30 years in my research, I can only reiterate the comments of my noble friend Lord Turnberg.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para3"></a>The definition of sex is extremely complicated. It is not just a question of chromosomes. It is possible of course to have chromosomal sex and it is probable, though by no means certain, that all of us in this Chamber have chromosomes that are either XX or XY. However, even in the case of Turner's syndrome, which my noble friend has just described, it is possible to have an XY mosaic, with some of the cells carrying a Y chromosome and some having a deleted X chromosome. The variations of that syndrome mean that people may have different degrees of masculinity or femininity.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para4"></a>Most practising doctors in the field would describe sex on six, totally separate, definitions. Those definitions can be chromosomal but, more importantly, they are genetic. It emerges that genes on the Y chromosome are not the only genes that define sex. Although the SRY gene is by far the most common and important, there are genes on chromosome 17, chromosome 11, chromosome 10, chromosome 6 and chromosome 3 that can, in exceptional circumstances, determine sex of various kinds. Those people can carry on a completely normal life.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para5"></a>Genetic sex is therefore no less important than chromosomal sex, but that is not the end of the story. There is also hormonal sex. Some people will produce <P>


<a name="column_620"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 620</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hormones that will tend to feminise them, while others will be masculinised. That can happen in utero. Good evidence has emerged from Professor Waters of Monash University in Australia&#151;he is now long retired&#151;that suggests that some people who become transsexuals later in life have been exposed to an abnormal surge of either male or female hormones during pregnancy. That has caused them to have a different psychological sex from their genital sex. Psychological sex of course depends on brain function. That also varies greatly and is probably genetically determined, but so much exploration of that subject is being conducted that it is not fully understood.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para6"></a>Genetics is rapidly changing our understanding of where sex is determined. But to define it simply as genital, hormonal or, as the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, seeks to do, as gonadal, is a travesty of what really happens.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para7"></a>Let me give one example. Janice was the most beautiful woman, who came to my unit some time ago. She was six feet tall, and had been brought up as a woman. She had very well developed breasts, a perfect physique, and was actually XY. She did not find that out until she was 20. Some people with XY dysgenesis believe themselves to be female and relish being female. Others find that when they are actually male because of their chromosomes, they entirely change their view psychologically.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para8"></a>I should like to make the point made by Robert Jaffe, now retired, a very distinguished endocrinologist. He says in his chapter on reproductive medicine headed "Disorders of Sexual Development":
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is crucial that the clinician who deals with patients with genital ambiguities be sensitive to the emotional as well as the physical needs of the patient. The patients frequently have a great deal of confusion and anxiety about their sexual roles. Whereas genetic, gonadal, hormonal, and genital sex may be of prime importance to the physician, the gender identity (that is, how the patient views himself or herself) and the sex of rearing are paramount in determining the patient's sexual identity".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-18_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40203-18_para10"></a>Robert Jaffe is effectively saying that there needs to be an understanding of the autonomy of the person concerned because, on the whole, they are the best people to judge how they feel about their sexuality. That is true of the 200 different mutations which could have affected Janice, my patient. There are so many different fluctuations in this broad spectrum of sexuality that I urge the House to be very cautious about defining it in terms of chromosomal, genital or any other simple definition. It simply is not medically just, and I am sure that it would produce bad law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I entirely support what the noble Lord, Lord Winston, has just said. Klinefelter's syndrome, in particular, seems to be quite common, occurring in one in 1,000 male births. We are not talking about a collection of extremely rare symptoms but about something which probably affects someone we know. I do not think there is any way in which we can sensibly define gender as a biological phenomenon. It is too much a continuum, much as we may like to think that it is separated. It just does not exist in that way.
<P>


<a name="column_621"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 621</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para11"></a>It makes the Minister's arguments quite attractive to say that someone's gender is what the law says it is and that is to be accepted. It will make for an interesting variant on the Scottish play&#151;a man not of woman born&#151;and there can be other explanations once the Bill is passed. It could perhaps explain what is going on in the words of "Colonel Bogey", when it was clear that the Third Reich was populated almost entirely by people afflicted by such symptoms.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para12"></a>The noble Lord knows that I sympathise with the amendment. What hurt me in the earlier amendments was the tearing apart of a marriage between a genetic man and a genetic woman just because of some legal fiction. That does offend me. But allowing a marriage between an emotional or a psychological man and a psychological woman who are apparently, in some aspects of their genetics, both of the same sex, is much more reasonable. I am happy to go down that route, particularly given the explanation of the noble Lord, Lord Winston. Tearing apart a real marriage seems much more serious than allowing the sort of marriages that will be allowed if the Bill is passed in its current form. I will therefore not be supporting the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, in this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-18_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, to listen to the noble Lord, Lord Winston, is always a fascination. His knowledge and experience of these matters go way beyond anything any of us would normally know about or experience. However, I do not agree with him that sex is quite difficult to decide. Sex, on the whole, is pretty obvious. There may be a difficulty in the one thousandth or one millionth case, but on the whole there cannot be a real difficulty because it is obvious, is it not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, it is novel to have the support of my noble friends Lord Turnberg and Lord Winston and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, at the same time. It is also a privilege. I will speak briefly, because as the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, and I spoke before we started this stage of the Bill, we have rehearsed these arguments in part before, although I am interested in some of the legal conundrums and challenges he posits for me today. I will look with interest at what he has said when I study Hansard and reflect on it.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para13"></a>At heart, the noble Lord knows that we will not agree because the system for recognition under the Bill in the acquired gender is not to be based on chromosomes or genitalia. It has been set on the tests that are set out on the face of the Bill, the three measures which we have debated time after time. Those do not turn on the genitalia or the exact chromosomes, nor should they, as my noble friends Lord Winston and Lord Turnberg have made clear so powerfully as part of their expert advice to us from their medical practice.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para14"></a>Sex and gender are not determined purely by chromosomes. Recognition, therefore, cannot depend purely on chromosomes. Similarly, having or lacking the right genitalia is not the nub of the Bill, and surgery <P>


<a name="column_622"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 622</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should not be a precondition either. The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, was with me on the last point, and I respect him for that.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para15"></a>The appropriate test is whether a person has taken decisive tests to live fully in the acquired gender and there is clear evidence of gender dysphoria after a proper process of inspection and testing over a number of years. We do not intend to compel transsexual people to undergo surgery, even though most wish to do so. The principle of legal recognition in the acquired gender will, subsequent to the issue of a gender recognition certificate, become the acquired gender for all purposes in law, as we have said before.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para16"></a>The amendment would have us define a person's gender in law in one way but define the person's gender for the purposes of marriage in another way. That goes against the central purpose of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para17"></a>Marriage in our society is a status for two parties of the opposite gender in law. The Bill retains that principle, hence the basic nature of marriage as an institution. The amendment would mean that a person who had been recognised by the state as being of a changed gender in law after the process we have discussed would not be able to marry. That would not be compliant with our ECHR obligations and would also, I believe, be wrong in principle for reasons we have debated many times.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para18"></a>I am grateful for the clarity that my noble friends Lord Turnberg and Lord Winston brought to the complexity of the issues. When I was younger, I tended to think that the world was rather simple. As one becomes older, one learns that the world is more complex; it is clearly more complex medically, whereas I perhaps focused on its greater social complexity. By and large, I have found that that complexity enriches life rather than diminishes it.
<P>

<a name="40203-18_para19"></a>With regard to what the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, said, we are talking about only 5,000 people in Britain. That is why this is such a unique and specific set of circumstances. This is one of the smallest minorities in our society, yet the evidence we have had prior to the Bill and during our debates shows that for that very small minority this issue is very significant. I think we have an obligation in justice to help them live their life as they believe it to be. Therefore, while I have a lot of respect for the unflinching opposition of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, to the Bill, we will not be able to support the amendment for these reasons, and I hope he will not press it.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. Let me make it absolutely plain that I would not be party to any legislation that forced a transsexual person to undergo surgical mutilation in order to benefit from the provisions of the Bill, if it becomes an Act of Parliament. That would be quite wrong and quite outrageous.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para0"></a>I am enormously flattered that this evening the Government had to bring in the heavy mob, in the shape of the noble Lord, Lord Winston, as well as the light cavalry in the shape of the noble Lord, <P>


<a name="column_623"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 623</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Turnberg&#151;light cavalry is a formidable weapon when it is used effectively. Let us not forget that it can even undo heavy cavalry.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para1"></a>Both noble Lords perhaps suffered from the disadvantage of not having read every word of the proceedings at earlier stages of the Bill, although I would not wish to sentence either of them to that, as it comes under the heading of cruel and unjust punishment. I have never maintained that there is a single test of sex. In this amendment, I propose a triple test. The noble Lord, Lord Winston, said that that is not satisfactory. I am terribly tempted to ask him&#151;particularly as I know that under the rules of the House he cannot speak again&#151;exactly how he would set about defining sex. I acknowledge that he said that it is extremely difficult.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para2"></a>It is a wonder to me that the human race has got on quite well for so long without the benefit of all this doubt about the matter. We have had marriage for centuries, for thousands of years, and we have always had an understanding&#151;initially informally but gradually more formally and eventually legislatively&#151;that marriage is possible only between people of opposite sexes. Now the noble Lord, Lord Winston, tells us that it is almost impossible to distinguish whether people are of opposite sexes. It would seem to indicate that we have been making a massive mistake of some kind for thousands of years. I do not accept that that is so. He is over-elaborate in his cautions. We may be in danger of damaging society, and the institution of marriage, because of these doubts that spring from our better understanding of the fact that no simple theory of the structure of life is adequate.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para3"></a>There is a legal requirement to differentiate between the sexes. We should not throw aside all common sense and experience, and rest everything upon the judgment of a couple of medical practitioners and, even worse, registered psychologists, particularly when in recent weeks we have seen just how fallible expert opinion may be. We all revere expert opinion. We all revered the opinion of the medical expert on whose expert evidence many women were unjustly sentenced to gaol for murder. We would be wise to ask whether we should uncritically accept expert advice or whether we should accept common sense advice. If we had accepted the common sense view, those women would not have been sentenced to gaol. They were sentenced to gaol by a medical expert. In future we shall rest our conclusion upon whether a couple may marry upon just such expert opinion. I would rather rest upon common sense. It is something that we have done in this country for a very long time. It is why we have juries. It is why we do not always trust judges, who are very expert, to come to the right conclusion unless they are assisted by juries.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para4"></a>The choice here is between what some people think and what all of us can see. We should choose what all of us can see.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, will he explain to me a point that is probably clear to others? He has said that we should not rely <P>


<a name="column_624"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 624</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>upon expert witnesses, but who, except an expert witness can tell us whether a particular person answers to one or other of the descriptions in his amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, the descriptions are not terribly difficult. Two-thirds of them would be obvious if the marriage ceremony were to take place in a nudist encampment. The other one, the definition of the chromosomes, is not terribly expert. It ought to be within the ability and experience of an A-level student in biology, although with the degradation in standards in schools and universities it would probably now take a master's degree.

<A NAME="40203-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin </B>   moved Amendment No. 87:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 26, line 5, leave out from beginning to first "gender" in line 6 and insert "A clergyman is not obliged to solemnise the marriage of a person if the clergyman reasonably believes that the person's"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-19_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40203-19_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I seek to be relatively crisp because this is not the first time that the Government have moved an amendment having sought to listen and respond to points made at earlier stages of a Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para10"></a>Ministers of the Church of England and the Church in Wales are legally obliged to solemnise the marriages of parishioners. The Bill therefore provides a conscience clause so that ministers are freed from their legal obligation if one of the parties to the marriage has been recognised in the acquired gender. Although the relevant minister may not wish to solemnise the marriage, there are plenty of other opportunities for a person to get married and not be debarred of their legal rights.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para11"></a>There is wide support for the principle of a conscience clause, including from the transsexual community. Similar provision exists, for example, in relation to a person who seeks to remarry after having been divorced.

<a name="40203-19_para12"></a>There was considerable discussion on this issue in Grand Committee. I accept the difficulty posed by the present version of the provision. If the person seeking to marry does not, or refuses to, tell the minister, a minister will not be in a position to know that a person has changed gender. Information about a person's change of gender is, for good reason, protected under the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para13"></a>We have listened to the arguments and consider that it is sensible to amend the schedule so that it provides protection for the conscience of a minister both where he or she knows that a person wishing to be married has been recognised in the acquired gender and where he or she has a reasonable belief that this is the case.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para14"></a>Were the noble Lord, Lord Chan, present, I would speak to his amendment in a little more detail. However, the succinct response regarding why we consider his amendment is inappropriate is that it is perfectly possible for an unreasonable belief to be held sincerely by a person. The noble Lord's amendment would therefore, if accepted, open up an injustice.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para15"></a>As I have said, we are open to addressing the concerns of the clergy regarding being able to act on their consciences on the matter. I have met with representatives of the Church of England and my officials have worked with them to formulate an acceptable form of words. I understand that the Church in Wales has examined the new wording of the schedule and is content with it.
<P>

<a name="40203-19_para16"></a>This is the first opportunity to pay tribute to someone else who has been a redoubtable adversary of the Government on this Bill. If I am being polite, that means that I have not agreed with every word that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, has said. However, I recognise the passion and sincerity with which she has argued her case. Therefore, it is fitting to recognise that today is her birthday. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40203-20_spnew0"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I have not been able to participate in earlier discussions on the Bill. However, I consider that it is important to place one reflection on record. In doing so I pay tribute to both Ministers and staff in the relevant departments who have engaged in very careful and thorough discussions with staff of the Church of England and with bishops about this matter. I do not wish my remarks to be pressed to the point of a vote on the amendment, but I wish to place on record that I and many others feel considerable discomfort at those regrettably frequent occasions when we come to the House as agents of the country's religious communities and ask for our consciences to be protected from a proposed law.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para0"></a>We need to recognise that the clause, which is an attempt to balance some difficult matters, makes it possible for a person who will have been through a nightmarish life experience to endure the suspicion and then rejection of their request to marry. Some of the stories that have come our way and some of the people I know, who are the subjects of the Bill, are asking no more than that they should be protected from being suspected, inquired into and perhaps gossiped about. The clause, for all its right protection <P>


<a name="column_627"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 627</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the consciences of some clergy, actually troubles the consciences of many others of us by what it puts certain people through in their request to be married.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para1"></a>I am not pressing the matter to a vote and I respect the attempts that the Government have made to produce a form of words which is acceptable. I also accept that if there is no conscience clause in the Bill there will be far stronger opposition to it than would otherwise be the case. However, I would not feel that I have done my job in the Chamber if I did not place on record the discomfort of a considerable number of people, when religious communities ask for their consciences to be protected from what society's conscience has come to think is right.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-20_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Goodhart and I and all other noble Lords who have discussed the matter are grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. She has been at great pains to try to explain to me and to others that the amendment is unnecessary. I think&#151;and when I say "I think" it is my fault, not hers&#151;that she has pointed out to me that no female to male transsexual will be disadvantaged in terms of his pension as a result of obtaining a gender recognition certificate; or, at least they will not be disadvantaged financially if they fall within a certain age group. That is the subject of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para13"></a>The issue was drawn to my attention by Mark Rees, a female to male transsexual who is well known because he brought one of the cases that went to the European Court and because he wrote an excellent autobiography about his experiences as a person who has had to endure the whole process and live with it for many years. He wrote to me to point out that people of his age&#151;that is, people who are now at the age <P>


<a name="column_628"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 628</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when, had they remained of female legal status, they would have retired or would have been about to retire and receive their pension&#151;find themselves potentially disadvantaged. It is a simple point. The Bill helpfully gives them the status of the gender which they have acquired once they obtain the certificate. A female to male transsexual, therefore, receives a pension at 65. A male to female transsexual receives a pension at 60. In legal terms that is as it should be. But there is an anomaly.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para14"></a>A person like Mr Rees will have gone through the process of law, which included going to the European Court of Human Rights; of lobbying, including a Private Member's Bill, which I presented in another place with the assistance of Mr Rees many years ago; and various other experiences that led him to the conclusion that he was never going to acquire the legal status of a man, which he is pleased to see that the Bill will give him. Of course he openly welcomes the Bill, almost without reservation. But it took a long time to reach the present position and successive governments made it clear to him that he was not going to reach it. So, he was entitled to assume that he would receive a pension at 60. There are possibly a dozen people who fall into that anomalous group. I suggest to your Lordships that we need to be sure that those people will not be disadvantaged in any way. We need to be sure that, even if they do not make themselves available for work because of their reasonable expectation of what was going to happen to them regarding their pensions, they will not find themselves disadvantaged.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para15"></a>Amendment No. 96, for which I do not claim anything except simplicity, is an attempt to put that issue in simple terms and to find a solution for it. I strongly suspect that the comments we will hear from the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, in response to this short debate will be a little more complex than the amendment. When she responds I should be grateful if she would make it absolutely clear&#151;since it may become a Pepper v Hart point&#151;that there is no risk of the people to whom I refer being disadvantaged in any way. If there is a risk, surely the way to deal with it is by an amendment such as this, which would remove all doubt. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, when we debated the Bill last week the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, made it clear that once an individual changed sex or acquired a different gender&#151;however one puts it&#151;they would henceforth be entitled to all the advantages and disadvantages, fiscal or otherwise, associated with that newly acquired gender. The amendment would allow a woman who has legally become a man to have his cake and eat it to some extent.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para16"></a>I thought from what the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, said last week that that was contrary to the Government's purpose, but the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, suggests otherwise. He suggests that his amendment sets out in clearer form what the Government intended all along. That totally puzzles me because it seems inconsistent with what the Government have said. If someone who <P>


<a name="column_629"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 629</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has become a man draws his state pension at 60, he is not being treated the same as all other men who have been men all the time.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para17"></a>Moreover, the right of women to receive the state pension five years earlier than men is an unjustifiable anomaly, as I believe all political parties now agree. I stand open to correction, but I believe the anomaly is being phased out over a period of years and not before time. In a sense, therefore, the amendment is retrograde.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para18"></a>If I am mistaken and that is what the Government intended all along, there is little I can do about it, but I should be grateful for an explanation from the Government Front Bench.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-20_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  My Lords, the amendment focuses on the state pension provision. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, proposes that some individuals who gain a gender recognition certificate should receive their state pension according to their acquired gender but that others should be given special status and receive their state pension according to their birth gender. Like the noble Lord, Lord Monson, I believe that that runs entirely counter to the principle of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para19"></a>Last Thursday, your Lordships' House decided that the marriage will end if one partner changes gender and wants to obtain a full gender recognition certificate. The amendment could not fit in with that decision. The marriage comes to an end and the consequence is that each partner must now be treated as an individual in his or her respective gender.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para20"></a>Let me focus on the fundamental difficulties which I believe are raised by the amendment, which is to allow category A pension provisions&#151;the basic 77 state pension&#151;for female to male transsexual people over the age of 50. The noble Lords feel that because such people have made financial preparations for retirement based on the expectation that they would be retiring at the age appropriate for women, we should respect and honour that by virtue of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para21"></a>I want to make four brief points because the noble Lord, Lord Monson, anticipated most of my argument. First, if female to male transsexual people over 50 who gain legal recognition of their acquired gender retain entitlement to the category A pension&#151;the basic 77 state pension&#151;as though they were still women, that clearly discriminates against those legal males who have not changed gender but would like the same right. We would be creating a special group of men who would be treated differently because of the fact they were once women, despite the fact that they want to be recognised as men. That is unfair and could, I am led to believe, be open to legal challenge. Obviously, I would defer to the weight of legal opinion on the Bench.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para22"></a>Secondly, if female to male transsexual people over 50 are to be treated for state pension purposes as remaining in their birth gender, it would be legally difficult not to <P>


<a name="column_630"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 630</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>treat the opposite group of transsexuals&#151;in fact the majority; those who are male to female&#151;in their birth gender for pension purposes also. They, too, presumably on the noble Lord's argument, have been planning their financial retirement as though they were going to retire at 65 while in their new gender they would be entitled to claim their basic state pension at 60. I emphasise that 80 per cent&#151;three-quarters or more&#151;of transsexual people move from male to female. In other words, if we are to be fair across the category of transsexual people, three-quarters would be disadvantaged for the one-quarter who might on this account gain. Obviously, one cannot distinguish only female to male; I would argue that one would have to distinguish similarly male to female. I do not believe that that would be reasonable.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para23"></a>The third point, in practical terms, is the financial situation mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile. Whether someone is male or female between the ages of 60, his or her financial situation can be virtually identical. Anyone over the age of 60&#151;male or female&#151;subject to income, is entitled to an income-related benefit which is pension credit. It used to be called MIG. That is important. It is worth 102 to the individual however much towards that 102 he or she brings in the form of basic state pension. In other words, if as a female she has a basic state pension in her own right of 50, 60, 70 or 77, MIG&#151;pension credit&#151;would top it up to 102. But if as a male by either birth or by acquired gender he does not yet have an entitlement to the basic state pension, he none the less, subject to income, can also get pension credit of 102. Therefore, in practice a female to male transsexual, a male to female transsexual, a birth male and a birth female will all receive the same sum of money between the ages of 60 to 65, subject to income, of 102 a week, whether there had been a change of gender or not.
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para24"></a>Finally, from 2010 we begin to equalise the retirement basic state pension age for both men and women alike. Not only will we be reducing financial difference in terms of eligibility for basic state pension between men and women, we will be reducing legal entitlement too,
<P>

<a name="40203-20_para25"></a>I have made four points. First, that it is not fair to men in their birth gender if some men in their new acquired gender have a different entitlement. Secondly, in all logic one would have to extend the same principle to male to female transsexuals and therefore the majority of transsexuals could lose financially in this package if one takes the argument of the noble Lord. Thirdly, eligibility for income-related benefits is the same irrespective of gender acquired or at birth between the ages of 60 and 65. Finally, we are equalising gender state retirement ages. I hope that with those four brief points, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para0"></a>The points on discrimination and legitimate expectation illustrate the dilemma we are in. We have a conflict between two concepts. On the one hand, we have the legitimate expectation in the example I gave of Mr Rees who was led by the Government, particularly by their hostility until recently into recognising he was a man, to expect that he would receive his pension not subject to income measurement at the age of 60. On the other hand, others might conceivably claim that they were discriminated against for the reasons the noble Baroness gave.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para1"></a>I do not accept for one moment that what has been said is a satisfactory answer for that very small number of people because a non-income-related benefit will be replaced by an income-related benefit in some cases. Among that small group, there will be people who have occupational pensions who will without doubt be losers. I find that unsatisfactory.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para2"></a>Having said that, in recent days I have spoken to and corresponded with people who are in this position. We all recognise that the Bill is a significant step forward in the law.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-21_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 introduced a number of new sections into the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. Their purpose was to extend the protection of the 1975 Act to transsexual people undergoing gender reassignment or who had undergone or intended to undergo it. The new sections did not extend the protection of transsexuals to the full width of the Act.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para7"></a>Section 2A, introduced by the 1999 regulations, extended the Sex Discrimination Act to cover transsexual people in relation to discrimination over employment under Part II of the Act, but did not extend protection against discrimination to the provision of goods and services under Part III.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para8"></a>Amendment No. 97 serves two purposes. First, it extends the rights of people undergoing or having undergone gender reassignment by forbidding discrimination in the provision of goods and services. Secondly, it recognises that male and female transsexual people will be entitled to the protection of the Sex Discrimination Act in their legal status as women. But discrimination may be specifically against male-to-female transsexuals and not against women generally; so there is a lacuna.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para9"></a>We see no adequate reason why the anti-discrimination legislation should be limited to discrimination in employment under Part II of the 1975 Act and not to discrimination in the provisions of goods and services under Part III of the Act.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para10"></a>The amendment's second purpose is to extend the protection expressly to transsexual people who have acquired, or intend to acquire, a gender recognition certificate. Gender reassignment, as defined in subsection (3) of Section 2A of the 1975 Act, involves medical treatment. That can, of course, be surgery, but it could also be hormone treatment without surgery. The majority of people who seek or obtain a gender recognition certificate will, as part of the process, undergo medical treatment of some kind, but it is not in fact a requirement of the Gender Recognition Bill that they should do so.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para11"></a>It seems pointless for a person who has obtained a gender recognition certificate to have to produce evidence of medical treatment to be able to bring a complaint about discrimination when the very existence of the certificate shows that they are people who are intended to be protected. The absence of any specific reference to people who have received gender recognition certificates may cause particular difficulties where the applicant has changed gender under the law of an approved foreign country and evidence of medical treatment would have to be obtained from abroad, which might present difficulties and perhaps involve the translation of documents.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para12"></a>Not only should the existing protection be extended to include Part III as well as Part II of the 1975 Act, but it should also involve a specific reference in Section 2A to those who have obtained gender recognition certificates, as well as to those who have undergone or may intend to undergo gender reassignment. I beg to move.

The thrust of our response is not that there are no issues worthy of study here, but that because of their complexity this is not the best place or time to do so and there will be another opportunity relatively shortly. I shall speak on that in a little more detail.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para13"></a>As the House knows, once gender recognition had been granted, an individual would be able to claim all the rights appropriate to that gender. The person would therefore have protection in the acquired gender under existing sex discrimination law. However, fundamentally, this Bill is about legal recognition in the acquired gender and not about the totality of anti-discrimination law.
<P>


<a name="column_633"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 633</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para14"></a>Anti-discrimination protection for transsexual people as transsexuals already exists in the areas of employment and vocational training. That has been set out in the Sex Discrimination Act since 1999. Protection is provided on the basis of intending to undergo, undergoing or having undergone gender reassignment. There are a number of exceptions relating to genuine occupational qualifications where the circumstances are specified in which discrimination on the grounds of gender reassignment is not unlawful.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para15"></a>Some of the exceptions apply only to a person who intends to undergo or is undergoing gender reassignment and not to a person who has undergone gender reassignment. However, the Act does not contain a definition of the point at which a person is to be regarded as having undergone gender reassignment. Therefore, the creation of a new legal status in this Bill gives us the opportunity to provide such a definition.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para16"></a>First, the Bill amends the Sex Discrimination Act so that the genuine occupational qualifications allowing discrimination on the grounds of gender reassignment will not apply in the case of people who have been legally recognised in their acquired gender. The effect would be that, while there would be occasions when it was legitimate to discriminate against a transsexual man or woman on the grounds of his or her acquired gender, it would no longer be permissible to discriminate against them in employment matters on the grounds that they were previously of another gender, unless the separate exception for organised religions under Section 19 is applicable.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para17"></a>However, a further extension of the protection against discrimination into the realm of goods and services would require an evaluation by the Government of the nature and extent of the problems faced by transsexual people in those areas. We would need to consider the implications and practicalities of extending the law, including the nature of new burdens on service providers in all sectors, including education, to which the amendment extends, and the necessity for exceptions in any particular circumstances. And, as has been the case in relation to this Bill, we would also want to have proper consultation with stakeholders and those affected.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para18"></a>We firmly believe that if that is to be done&#151;we have heard the arguments that have been made today&#151;it should be done only once a recognition system is in place and once the impact of recognition in the acquired gender has been evaluated. That would provide better evidence of the nature of the problems. For the reasons that I have touched on, we do not think it right suddenly to do so as part of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para19"></a>However, I do not believe that that is an argument for unreasonable delay. On 5 November 2003, the European Commission published a draft directive on sex discrimination in the field of goods and services. Negotiations on that directive will provide a suitable forum in which discussions can take place with our European partners and the Commission. Those discussions will provide a far broader, European-wide discussion of the issue, including the possible need for exemptions and legal protection against discrimination.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para20"></a>Taking action in this Bill would risk the possibility of having to revisit the same area of anti-discrimination law once the directive was finalised. It would be unhelpful if we were to legislate now in haste and then find, as I believe would almost inevitably be the case, in a relatively few years' time that we had to legislate again because a significant number of burdens were placed on service providers to bring themselves into compliance as a consequence. If they were required to do so twice, I believe that that would be unreasonable.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para21"></a>Having said all that, we hear the arguments surrounding the issues most clearly. They will be issues for ongoing study within government and will inform our discussions with the European Commission and the relevant parts of the Council of Ministers on these matters. We shall look to amass evidence and experience as part of that process.

That seems to me to short-circuit some of the evidence that it would be necessary to produce without in any way taking decisions about the extension of the coverage of the anti-discrimination laws.
<P>

<a name="40203-21_para22"></a>However, there is obviously a considerable degree of comfort in the knowledge that the Government are planning to consider this matter in the wider context of the proposed European directive. In those circumstances, it would obviously be inappropriate for us to push this issue to a Division. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
is to be regarded as a person who is undergoing or has undergone gender reassignment for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4).""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-22_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall also speak to Amendment No. 101 in my name. They are identical except that Amendment No. 98 refers to Great Britain and the other to Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para2"></a>The purpose of these amendments is to allow a Church to refuse employment to a person who will not consent to the disclosure of an entry relating to them on the gender recognition register. Any employer will say that getting the right person for the job is essential. <P>


<a name="column_635"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 635</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>In any business if the right person is employed it goes brilliantly, but if the wrong person is employed it becomes a disaster. It can have a very negative effect on the whole organisation if someone is employed who does not share the basic values, or what we term in business "the ethos of the business".
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para3"></a>If that is true in a secular organisation how much more true it is in a religious organisation. In a religious group the staff are bound together by very strong beliefs on fundamental issues and shared values. These are beliefs not about mundane matters such as management style or marketing techniques, but about human nature, right and wrong and the nature of truth.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para4"></a>Churches teaches us that our sex is decided by God. They also teach that your sex is a matter of absolute truth, not personal choice. I ask, how could a Church employ a transsexual who effectively believes that God got his sex wrong? How can they employ a person who, in their eyes, lives a lie by impersonating the opposite sex?
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para5"></a>The Government know that it is wrong to force this on religious groups. In 1999 they enshrined the right of religious bodies to refuse to employ transsexuals. This is found in Section 19 of the Sex Discrimination Act. Yet only five years later we are severely limiting the ability of Churches to exercise that right by taking away their right to know the birth sex of the candidate for employment. If a job applicant conceals his or her transsexualism religious employers will have no way of knowing it.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para6"></a>At present they can resolve any doubts they may have by requesting sight of the birth certificate. Either the person will supply it, in which case it will declare their true sex, or they will decline it in which case they can be turned down on the basis of bad faith.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para7"></a>But this Bill takes that option away. It would be pointless to ask for a birth certificate to verify their sex because it will simply confirm the applicant's version as to his or her sex. As a way of establishing a person's true biological sex, birth certificates will in effect become useless.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para8"></a>Of course, the Church can ask a direction question: have you changed sex? Some transsexuals will be honest and answer truthfully, but some will not. They may have a deep- seated urge to conceal their true sex. They may have no compunction at all about saying, "No, I have not changed sex. I have always been what I am now". The Church may then feel that it has no choice but to believe them. It might not emerge that they have been deceived until months or years later.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para9"></a>Why do the Government not seem to care about this possibility? Why do they recognise that it is changing the nature of the relationship between the Church and its potential employees?
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para10"></a>I ask the Minister three questions. First, does he understand the dilemma that Churches face through not knowing the true sex of job applicants? Secondly, what is a Church supposed to do about it? Thirdly, does the Minister agree that it would be offensive to <P>


<a name="column_636"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 636</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Churches, mosques or temples or other religious bodies who are employers, to discover that they had unwittingly employed a transsexual?
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para11"></a>The human rights barrister, Paul Diamond, issued a legal opinion about this Bill on 26 January. He believes that the Bill may breach the freedom of religion under Article 9 of the European Convention. He put it like this:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is rather like saying to a Muslim school: 'We don't know if the food given to your children has pork in it. Further, you are not allowed to inquire, or check whether this is the case'. Thus the choice for the Muslim is not to eat. Or to say to a Jewish person, that you should become a vegetarian as you cannot secure Kosher meat. The very posing of the question illuminates the clear violation of religious rights".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-22_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40203-22_para13"></a>If we say that we respect people's religious opinions we must take steps to avoid this scenario. This Bill must be amended to protect the existing rights of Church employers. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the amendments seek to ensure that a person who has acquired a new gender under the Bill or who will not consent to disclosure of their entry in the gender recognition register is covered by the exemptions in Section 19(3) and (4) of the Sex Discrimination Act. Those subsections allow discrimination against those who are undergoing or have undergone gender reassignment in relation to employment, authorisation or qualification for the purposes of an organised religion, provided that this is done to comply with a religious doctrine or to avoid offence to the religious susceptibilities of a significant number of the religion's followers.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para14"></a>I am happy to be able to reassure the noble Baroness and the House that no addition to Section 19 is needed, as the existing provisions already do all that is needed.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para15"></a>Where a person is refused employment, or an authorisation, or qualification, this is unlawful under Section 2A of the Sex Discrimination Act only if it is done,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"on the ground that the person intends to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone gender reassignment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-22_para16"></a>
Whether or not that is the case is a question of fact for the tribunal, were one to be engaged to decide on the case. What is important to note is that wherever it is found that an organised religion has discriminated on this ground they are entitled in principle to seek to claim the benefit of the exemption in Section 19.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para17"></a>I shall deal with the concerns which underlie this part of the amendments. The amendments suppose that a person who has acquired a new gender under the Bill applies for employment or ordination for the purposes of an organised religion but refuses to consent to the register being consulted. In this situation, if the Church refuses employment or ordination, it is very likely that the discrimination would be held to have been on the ground that the person has undergone gender reassignment. The Church will therefore be entitled to seek to rely on the relevant part of Section 19.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para18"></a>The Church will succeed under Section 19 only if it can show that the restrictions imposed satisfy the tests laid down in Section 19. In other words, the Church will have to show that the restrictions were imposed to <P>


<a name="column_637"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 637</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>comply with a religious doctrine or to avoid offending the religious susceptibilities of a significant number of the religion's followers, which is, I think, the thrust of the noble Baroness's amendment. The fact that the Church had not seen the gender recognition register would not prevent it from seeking to rely on this examination.
<P>

<a name="40203-22_para19"></a>Amendment No. 99 seeks to insert into the Bill an exemption covering ordination and appointment. We have already said in Grand Committee that the question of whether the Church may discriminate against transsexual people in these respects is one that must be answered in the context of our EU obligations and specifically the Equal Treatment Directive that must be implemented by October 2005. We have clearly also signalled that we would be happy to continue discussions with the Church about that issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for giving way, but we are not talking about Amendment No. 99, which is the amendment of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester and is not grouped with my amendments. Unfortunately, the right reverend Prelate is not present.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I apologise. I will say no more on that. Amendments Nos. 100 and 102 would add a new Section 33&#151;

The actual amendments I am speaking to are Amendments Nos. 98 and 101. They are very narrow ones and are identical. Amendment No. 98 applies to Great Britain and Amendment No. 101 applies to Northern Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for her help. I shall seek to find any relationship to Amendment No. 101 in my notes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-22_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I can help the Minister. I do not think it matters because both amendments refer to the same point. Amendment No. 98 applies to Great Britain and Amendment No. 101 to Northern Ireland, but the wording is identical.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="40203-23_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister, in particular for his gracious handling of the amendment. He said that my amendment is unnecessary because Section 19 already allows the Church to refuse to employ any transsexual whether or not they have a gender recognition certificate.
<P>


<a name="column_638"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 638</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para0"></a>The point is that Section 19 should cover all transsexuals. That needs to be made explicit on the face of the Bill to avoid Churches having to foot the bill for litigation on this point. We also need to avoid rogue court rulings. Schedule 6 states that a person with a gender recognition certificate is not a transsexual for the purposes of Section 7A of the Sex Discrimination Act. We do not want an employment tribunal reading that across and saying that the same applies to Section 19. That is the purpose of my amendment. Although I would love to say that the Minister has given me great comfort, I fear that he thinks that Section 19 would be adequate; I fear that it will not be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down perhaps I may say that I shall study yet again what she has said to see if there is any further engagement we can have on this before Third Reading to identify whether there is a significant difference between us on policy or law, or whether we have not been clear enough about the nature of the issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. Certainly, I shall take him up on his offer. Therefore, I have great pleasure in begging leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-23_para3"></a>The right reverend Prelate said: My Lords, in the unavoidable absence of my noble friend the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester, I rise to move Amendment No. 99 standing in his name. In substance it is identical to the amendment he moved in Grand Committee and reflects concerns which he raised at Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para4"></a>The amendment is intended to safeguard members of churches and other faith communities against the risk of liability under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 when they act on the basis of doctrines of their religion or the strongly held convictions of a significant number of the followers of their religion in relation to selection and training for ordained or recognised, authorised work or service.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para5"></a>I emphasise that the amendment does not seek a blanket exemption to discriminate in matters of employment, let alone membership. We shall come to those issues later where, indeed, the Church of England seeks no such exemption. Our concern is with public representative office, which ordination&#151;and perhaps a limited number of other roles&#151;conveys, and where we believe a genuine and determining occupational requirement could be demonstrated.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para6"></a>On a number of occasions during the passage of the Bill, reference has been made to the need to balance the proper rights of transsexual people with the proper rights of other parties. Section 13 of the Human Rights Act requires courts involved in determining human rights to have particular regard to the exercise by the religious organisation of the convention right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para7"></a>As we move into a more overtly multicultural and multiracial Britain, the need to recognise and respect the reasonable rights of minorities will become progressively more evident in a whole range of issues. The case for appropriate safeguards in this matter was recognised by the Minister when he spoke in Grand Committee. He acknowledged that as well as providing rights for transsexual people, the Bill protects the rights and freedoms of others where appropriate. The Minister went on to say that these protections would be best provided not in the Bill itself but in the regulations that will need to be introduced to give effect to the equal treatment directive, which must be implemented by the United Kingdom by October 2005.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para8"></a>I can see the case for dealing with all these matters together in the round, in the totality of the situation, as the Minister put it in Committee. Will the Minister confirm that the Government recognise the potential rights of religious communities and minorities in relation to the appointment of transsexual people to representative public office or equivalent roles? Whether this is dealt with in the Bill, as the amendment proposes, or in regulations is of secondary concern.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para9"></a>We would prefer it to be in the Bill, both as a guarantee of this recognition, but also because, as things stand, there is likely to be a gap between the passing into law of the Bill&#151;the Minister mentioned April 2005&#151;and the new regulations, which must come in by October 2005. As I understand it, there will <P>


<a name="column_640"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 640</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be no legal protection for Churches and religious groups in that gap, which is a cause of considerable concern. If the matter is to be dealt with by regulations, can the Minister assure the House that the gap between the enactment of the Bill and the regulations will be kept to a minimum? Might it even be the case that the equal treatment directive could be implemented in two stages, the first dealing with transsexual and other areas relating to sexual discrimination legislation? Perhaps that might be considered.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para10"></a>Let me be clear. This amendment has a limited, but vital scope. I seek the Minister's assurance that the strictly limited concerns that are outlined here are shared by the Government and will be recognised by appropriate action without any avoidable delay. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, noble Lords will be relieved that I will not speak at great length on this, but not because the issues are not important. We have already signalled our position. Amendment No. 99 seeks to insert into the Bill an exemption covering ordination appointments. We have already said at Grand Committee that the question of whether the Church may discriminate against transsexual people in these respects is one that must be answered in the context of our EU obligations, specifically the equal treatment directive, which must be implemented by October 2005.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para11"></a>I hope, and I have some confidence, that it has been pretty clear from how we have handled this Bill so far that where it is possible to accommodate the profoundly held beliefs of religious organisations, without infringing the human rights of transsexuals, we have been open to discussions and efforts to do so. I make that clear, with that caveat, without that being a total blank cheque, that we will continue those discussions in the nature of the equal treatment directive.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para12"></a>In so far as the present position in law is concerned, office holders are not covered under the existing employment protection that is accorded to transsexual people. This will change with the implementation of the equal treatment directive, but this Bill will itself make no change to the existing position. That is why we have said before, and we say again today, that the discussions that have taken place with the Church will continue in preparation for that implementation. I hope that the right reverend Prelate will feel minded to withdraw his amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-23_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 100, 102 and 108. Again, we have a situation like the last two amendments that I moved. Amendments Nos. 100 and 102 are identical: Amendment No. 100 applies to Great Britain and Amendment No. 102 to Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para16"></a>The purpose of Amendments Nos. 100 and 102 is to prevent litigation under the Sex Discrimination Act, which forces religious bodies to allow those with gender recognition certificates into membership or to use the facilities provided. The purpose of Amendment No. 108 is to query why the Government are willing to give wide exemptions to sporting bodies, but are reluctant to make concessions for religious groups. The grouping is a bit crazy, but I hope that it will be all right.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para17"></a>Amendments Nos. 100 and 102 deal with what one might call the "Bill Parry scenario". Mr Parry has been mentioned several times, at Second Reading, in Grand Committee and on the first day of Report. He was a Congregationalist minister, a husband and the father of three. A few years ago, he decided to change sex. He started attending the Maesteg Christian Centre. The Church believed that it was morally wrong to try to change sex, but, for two years, he attended none the less.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para18"></a>Mr Parry would not accept the Church's teaching on transsexualism, and matters came to a head when the Church refused to allow him to attend the ladies' prayer meeting and would not let him use the ladies' toilet. Mr Parry is an activist and has used the law more than once against people who would not treat him as a woman. In July 2000, he won a 6,000 out-of-court settlement with a college. He claimed that it had discriminated against him, as he was on its beauty therapy course. Three months later, he forced the Welsh equivalent of the Women's Institute to change its membership policy. So, it was no surprise when, in 2002, he sued Maesteg Christian Centre over access to the ladies' fellowship and use of the ladies' toilet.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para19"></a>The Church engaged a barrister and successfully resisted Mr Parry's legal action, but the judge expressed strong sympathy with Mr Parry and criticised the Church. Even though the Church won the action, the judge ordered it to pay some of its legal <P>


<a name="column_642"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 642</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>costs. Sadly, if the Bill had been in force, the judge might have found a way of giving Mr Parry what he wanted. There is plenty of scope for that in the Bill. The Bill says that a man who holds a gender recognition certificate is to be treated in law as a woman. Clause 9 says that he is a woman for all purposes. That means that he is entitled to sue for discrimination as a woman under the Sex Discrimination Act.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para20"></a>The Government are creating a new legal landscape, in which the sort of action pursued by Mr Parry could succeed. After all, what legal justification could a Church have for refusing to allow a woman to use the women's toilets? Even if a legal action failed, Churches would have to put up with the distress and might even have to foot the bill. We must put protections against that into the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para21"></a>Amendment No. 108 simply gives me the opportunity to point out the inconsistency between the Government's treatment of sports bodies and their treatment of religious bodies. I feel sure that the Minister will have had a sense of deja vu, when he saw the wording of Amendment No. 108. As noble Lords will have noticed, it mirrors closely the wording of government Amendment No. 107, exempting sporting bodies.
<P>

<a name="40203-23_para22"></a>The Government are willing to make broad, far-reaching exemptions for sports bodies. I support that, and I think that it is brilliant. However, they have not yet brought forth anything similar for religious bodies. The Minister will say that Churches can already discriminate and that there is no need for the amendment. I would nearly bet on that. However, in Grand Committee on 14 January, he said that there was no need for amendments to protect sport; then, he changed his mind. I ask him gently to change his mind about protecting religious bodies. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40203-24_spnew0"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I feel obliged to reiterate more strongly the point that I made earlier today. As we debate the matters, a picture is being built up in which organised religion always takes one view of the question. What will be the situation of the Government in the discussions, when they are faced with people who purport to represent the views of a religious body but actually represent only part of that body, in which there are others who hold the opposite point of view with equal force?
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para0"></a>I do not know whether it is known in the House, but when the House of Bishops of the Church of England discussed this subject, it was clear that we had to acknowledge the existence in the Church of England of two equally strongly held doctrinal positions on the matter. I shudder at the thought of government having to adjudicate on the doctrinal position of an organised religion. I recognise that the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"religious susceptibilities of a significant number of its followers",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-24_para1"></a>
are already enshrined in statute. But they are highly dangerous. When I hold a religious sensibility, to me a significant number is one. I do not think that that is true of other people's religious convictions, but I notice that other people behave in similar ways. 
<P>

<P>

<a name="40203-24_para2"></a>For the Government to confer on religious bodies the right to create membership qualifications that go against the convictions of the society in which those religions function, and to be protected when they do so, is a dangerous precedent. I urge the Minister to bear in mind in the conversations that will proceed in the coming months that, like gender, organised religion is a complex matter. The convictions and doctrines of organised religion are also complex. I am well aware of a significant number of members of the Church of England who find the collection of exemptions along these lines deeply offensive.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I shall listen to the Minister's reply with great interest, and shall do so in part in the light of what the right reverend Prelate has just said. What my noble friend has proposed is permissive, not obligatory. It is available for that section of any belief that holds her view without compelling any section that does not hold her view. To that extent, I feel that the objection of the right reverend Prelate is without much force.
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para3"></a>I want to return to something that the right reverend Prelate said earlier when he expressed his discomfort in general&#151;not in particular terms&#151;at the position taken by my noble friend. Had it been expressed in particular terms, I would have been less concerned by it. He said that he was very concerned when the Church asked for shelter from the consequences of disagreeing with something with which the majority of society had come to a conclusion. I always thought that it was the function of Churches to do exactly that&#151;to stand firm when the majority of society got things wrong. I am not saying that society got it wrong in this respect, as I see the right reverend Prelate quivering on the edge of intervening. I am referring to the general principle. I am thinking of the Church in Germany in the 1930s and early 1940s, and indeed, of our Churches during the civil war. It is plainly the duty of a religious body&#151;especially a Church, and my own Church, in particular&#151;to stand by principles when the majority of society has got them wrong, as they now have in many respects. I am not speaking about the Bill when I say that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-24_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may assist the noble Lord. It might help if I say what my intervention would have been, rather than what he thought it might have been.
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para4"></a>My concern is not that the Church should comply with everything that society says. It cannot be said that I advocate that position. My concern is that the Church should not seek protection from the costs of its obedience.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, that is a much more honourable and enlightened position, but as to my first question, I shall leave it to the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for that challenge. It almost feels too late to go into full detail on all these issues. However, I am <P>


<a name="column_644"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 644</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grateful for being exposed to an alternative set of pressures from the ones to which I am usually exposed on this Bill. That is healthy and it is a reminder to Government of how one has to be cautious in trying to uphold two sets of rights. Clearly, in part, much of these discussions has concerned trying, if possible, to provide the proper rights to transsexual people that we clearly believe should be provided in a civilised society, and to do so in a way that does not, at the same time, infringe the right to freedom of religion and to freedom of religious expression. We are debating on that cusp.
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para5"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, gave me plenty of fervour and examination questions to take away with me. I shall not respond to them all tonight, but I shall look at them. For now, I shall make a few comments on the record.
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para6"></a>Amendments Nos. 100, 102 and 108 would add a new Section 33A to the Sex Discrimination Act and Article 34A to the equivalent Northern Ireland order. The provisions will provide religious bodies with the freedom to restrict membership or the provision of benefits, facilities or services in such a way as to exclude a person who is recognised in the acquired gender or who will not consent to the disclosure of any entry relating to them in the gender recognition register. Amendment No. 108 has the same purpose.
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para7"></a>On the face of it, that is a wide-ranging exemption. However, it would have no effect, as neither the Sex Discrimination Act nor the Northern Ireland order at present extends protection to transsexual people in terms of membership of religious organisations or the provision of benefits, facilities or services. As I have already explained, we do not consider it appropriate in this Bill to extend protection against gender reassignment discrimination to the area of goods, facilities and services, not as a point of principle, but as a point of practice. There is a better forum for engaging in those issues.
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para8"></a>The Bill is concerned with providing transsexual people with access to a means of acquiring legal recognition; it is not an anti-discrimination Bill per se. The only changes that it makes to anti-discrimination law are consequential changes: providing access to legal recognition in the applied gender. We have had, and no doubt will continue to have, discussions with the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, and representatives of Evangelical Alliance, for whom I hasten to say she does not speak. I was not seeking to ally her with a Christian institution.
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para9"></a>On the outcome of Mr Parry's case, I do not want to comment on a particular case. The Bill does not open up a new class of discrimination claims. As I have already said, we are not using the Bill to extend discrimination on the ground of gender reassignment.
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para10"></a>On sporting bodies, one is damned if one does and damned if one does not. We have been willing to provide an exemption for sporting bodies, but the Bill is not about discrimination. The exemption for sport is of a different character. It does not permit a sporting body to restrict the participation of all transsexual people; it allows a restriction only where that is necessary to secure fair competition or safety of other <P>


<a name="column_645"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 645</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>competitors. An exemption for religion, at least under the terms proposed, would apply to all transsexual people.
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para11"></a>I shall say no more about access to lavatories or other such issues. On a general point, I recollect, either tonight or previously, a question being asked about the Women's Institute. The present law would not prevent an organisation like the Women's Institute discriminating against a transsexual person if it wished to do so, as the Women's Institute could not be considered to be exercising a public function in considering applications for membership and, therefore, it would not be a public body. But I hope that it would not discriminate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-24_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister again. I see the Bill as opening up the prospect of litigation against the Churches, which concerns me.

<a name="40203-24_para15"></a><P>

"( ) Nothing in this section shall prevent the holders of any peerage or dignity or title of honour who are in receipt of a gender recognition certificate from styling themselves as if they had inherited the peerage or dignity or title of honour in their acquired gender, and the persons concerned shall have the right to require any organisation or body of which they are a member to address them by the style appropriate to their acquired gender.
<br>
( ) A person who is the holder of an order of chivalry which is limited to one sex shall after receipt of a gender recognition certificate have the right to petition for conferment of the equivalent degree of the order of chivalry appropriate to their acquired gender."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-24_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in speaking to Amendment No. 103 I return to a debate that we had in Grand Committee about peerages. Noble Lords will recall that Clause 16 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The fact that a person's gender has become the acquired gender under this Act . . .  does not affect the descent of any peerage or dignity or title of honour".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-24_para17"></a>
In a sense, the clause provides for an exceptional treatment for peerages, in the way that Clause 15 provides for a different treatment for succession. In Grand Committee, we expressed our concern that if, for example, a male baron were to become a female, that male would not then be able to call himself a baroness. Similarly, an earl could not become a countess. Amendment No. 103 illustrates to the Government just one of our concerns about a number of anomalies in the Bill relating to how individuals should be treated in particular circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40203-24_para18"></a>Noble Lords will note that my noble friend Lord Ferrers has tabled an amendment about peerages. I defer to him for he knows much more about peerages than do I. Indeed, I suspect that he knows much more about succession than do I.

<a name="40203-24_para19"></a>The Government conceded in Grand Committee that there were "issues to consider", not only about how title is officially recognised, but also about how other matters flow from the holding of a title. The Minister has since courteously written to me about those further considerations. It seems that a possible solution has been found. However, I would prefer to wait to hear the Minister's response to my noble friend Lord Ferrers about that solution. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-25_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, as my amendment has been grouped with this one, I shall make some observations. My noble friend Lady Buscombe kindly said that I knew more about peerages and succession than does she. I do not know whether that is true, but I certainly do not know more than does she about changing gender. I have been lost in admiration at your Lordships' ability to understand the complexity of the Bill, in particular that of Ministers, who have fought bravely to defend it and all its complications.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para0"></a>I have a number of questions to ask. I suppose that I should declare an interest in so far as I am a hereditary Peer and the clause relates to hereditary peerages. I assure your Lordships that any interest I declare is not personal, but arises merely because I am a hereditary Peer.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para1"></a>In Grand Committee, I thought it extraordinary that the Government wanted to help hereditary Peers, because normally they do not. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, is shaking her head. Before she shakes it, perhaps she should hear what I say. It was extraordinary that they should help hereditary Peers by inserting a special clause for their benefit. I felt that either the Bill is so good that it should apply to everyone or that it is so bad that the Government cannot find a way of getting round the issue without making an exception for hereditary Peers. I shall quote what the noble Lord, Lord Evans, said in Grand Committee. He can sit in his place and be frightened. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I said that it raised a number of very interesting and important issues that the Government must consider. I said that we would go away and consider the points raised and return before Report with amendments".&#151;[Official Report, 14/1/04; col. GC 105.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-25_para2"></a>
I became very excited. I thought that the Government had at last taken note of something that I had said. However, when I looked at the list of amendments, the Government had not put one down to address this problem. So I tabled an amendment to leave out Clause 16 to find out exactly what it means because, quite frankly, I do not understand it.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para3"></a>Clause 16 says that the fact that a person's gender has become the acquired gender under this Act,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"does not affect the descent of any peerage or dignity or title of honour".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-25_para4"></a>
I can understand that. However, Clause 16(b) says that it,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"does not affect the devolution of any property limited (expressly or not) by a will or other instrument to devolve (as nearly as the law permits) along with any peerage or dignity or title of honour unless an intention that it should do so is expressed in the will or other instrument".

<FONT SIZE=3>
I am not a lawyer; the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew is, and he no doubt understands that perfectly. However, I do not understand what it means and I would be grateful if the Minister would explain what it means.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para6"></a>I would like some explanations to some serious points, and I hope the Minister will answer them. What happens if an earl has a sex change? In order to make certain that there is no duplicity, we will call him Earl Dodger and his son Viscount Chump. If Earl Dodger has a sex change, does he become a countess, in which case there will then be two Countess Dodgers? Or does he remain as an earl although he masquerades as a woman?
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para7"></a>As the earl has changed from being a male to a female, what happens to the title? Does Viscount Chump suddenly inherit the earldom and become an earl as the earldom is apparently vacant? That does not seem right because you would then have two earls. What happens if Countess Dodger, on the other hand, changes sex and becomes a man? What does she become? Does she become Earl Dodger, so that there are two earls? She cannot, because she was not appointed. What does she do?
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para8"></a>Let us suppose that Earl Dodger has a son and a daughter. Let us suppose that the daughter is older and that she has a sex change and becomes a man. Does she then become Viscount Chump instead of her younger brother who, up till now, was Viscount Chump? If she does become Viscount Chump, does she inherit everything else? Does she inherit the title of earl instead of the proper Viscount Chump, and all the cash, if there is any? In my experience, earls do not have much cash nowadays, but they used to in the good old days. What happens to the proper Viscount Chump? There may be a trust fund under which it all goes to the holder of the earldom. Does the lady get that and, if so, will she remain friends with her brother?
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para9"></a>Clause 16(a) states that the Bill does not affect the descent of any peerage or title of honour. Of course it does&#151;it goes to someone to whom it was not supposed to go.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para10"></a>I have read Clause 16(b) six times and I cannot understand it. It says that the fact that a person's gender has become the acquired gender does not affect the devolution of any property unless an intention that it should do so is expressed in a will. In years gone by, quite a lot of these properties were expressed in wills by grandfathers and great-grandfathers who did not have the curiosities that exist nowadays.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para11"></a>If it is intended that the land owned by an earl should pass on to the next earl, and if Earl Dodger becomes a woman and vacates the earldom, does he have to pass his land on to Viscount Dodger, who presumably becomes the earl? Of course, he cannot become the earl, because the earl is still alive. It does not seem very fair, and it happens to nobody else in the country. I hate to put it like this, but the Government are discriminating against hereditary Peers. They have always hated hereditary Peers but I think hereditary Peers are jolly good folk. It is a pity to see the <P>


<a name="column_648"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 648</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government discriminate in this way by suddenly saying that the Bill is wonderful, but the change must not appear to be part of the peerage.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, made an interesting remark in a letter to my noble friend Baroness Buscombe:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The hereditary principle is hence untouched. However, this does mean that a person recognised in law as a woman may inherit a 'male title'. Clearly, a person in this position may wish to seek a change to the form of address".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-25_para13"></a>
He said that the whole purpose of the Bill is to allow a woman to inherit a male title. Yet, earlier on, it said that there would be no change. In his letter, the noble Lord goes on to say that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subsequent to these discussions",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-25_para14"></a>
that he had with Garter Principal King of Arms,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is clear that a person in this position would be free to petition Her Majesty for a change in the form of address. Therefore, rather than making the detailed provision in the Bill to deal with every possibility, we believe that this issue should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and that this discretion should rest with Her Majesty".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-25_para15"></a>
Do the Government mean to say that they have introduced a Bill that is so complicated, and has made such a mess of everything, including the peerage, that the only way out is to get Her Majesty to resolve it? I find that quite extraordinary.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para16"></a>I shall remind your Lordships of what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester said in Committee. He asked what happens if a female priest changes sex and becomes a man and said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It [is] an infringement of her rights that Crockford's"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-25_para17"></a>
or, as the right reverend Prelate also mentioned, Who's Who, Debrett's or Dod's&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"continued to contain details of the early stages of her ministry".&#151;[Official Report, 14/1/04; col. GC 105.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-25_para18"></a>
If one removes the first part of a person's career from a professional directory, where does the editor stand in terms of the Trade Descriptions Act? I thought that that was a very trenchant point by the right reverend Prelate. The Government did not have an answer to that.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para19"></a>What happens if, as one does, one has a medical directory? Suppose there is a person who becomes a doctor, goes through the training, becomes a surgeon and decides to become a woman? Is the directory to cut all that out of a person's previous career? Would not anyone employing that person as a surgeon want to know where that person was educated, what medical school he or she went to and what happened in her career? That must all be cut out because she has changed sex and it must not be referred to.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para20"></a>One could say that if one looked in Dod's, or in a similar directory, and saw that a person was educated, for instance, at Winchester and Magdalene College, Cambridge, even though she was a woman, one could discover that she was probably a man because those places usually educate men not women. No attempt has been made to answer these points.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para21"></a>The Minister who will respond to this amendment&#151;I am not certain who it will be, but I have a good idea that it will be the noble Lord, Lord Evans&#151;may say <P>


<a name="column_649"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 649</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that when people are in positions of importance, such as bishops, priests, surgeons, Peers, and anyone in public life, everyone will know that they have changed sex and they do not have to worry about it. It is only people lower down the echelons who the Government are worrying about. That is no way to produce a Bill. If the Bill is so good that it has to refer to these 5,000 who, regrettably, for reasons with which we all sympathise, have to change sex, it must refer to everyone; a group cannot be excluded.
<P>

<a name="40203-25_para22"></a>The real answer is that the Bill is so bad because it is based on a deception. The whole idea is a deception. My noble friend Lord Tebbit, who regrettably is not here, has said this all along. It is based on a deception whereby you say, "Here is a person who was born a female," and then you say, "We have decided 40 years later that he was born a male". That is a deception. It turns nature topsy-turvy. I hope that the noble Lord who replies to the amendment will provide perfectly clear and not complicated answers to these questions as the measure has turned nature upside down and we should like to know what the position is.

<A NAME="40203-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, is an extremely hard act to follow when talking about matters of this kind. I shall not even try to emulate his tour de force. However, there are a couple of points that even he did not cover in his splendid peroration.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para0"></a>If I have interpreted the noble Baroness's speech correctly, which I hope that I have, I am relieved to learn that Amendment No. 103 is in effect tongue-in-cheek. I hope that I am right about that because, if it is not, we must consider some of the consequences. Clause 16 as it stands talks only about descent but Amendment No. 103 refers to actual titles. If a baronet were to change his sex, presumably he would become either a lady or possibly a dame, I am not sure which. However, if the amendment is tongue-in-cheek, that does not really matter.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para1"></a>The other curious aspect of the amendment is that it would give someone the right to require an organisation or body to address them by the style appropriate to their acquired gender. How can they do that? No criminal penalties are set out in the amendment or in the Bill. Would the people in question be able to take civil action against the organisation in question to force it to address them in a certain style? I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.

<A NAME="40203-26_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the whole of this Report stage has been worthwhile just to hear the noble Lord say that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, for that. He challenged me to answer all the questions that he raised. I shall not do so this evening as we hope to finish by 10 or 10.30 p.m. However, the week-long holiday will soon arrive and I should be very happy to spend that week with the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, talking about the extraordinary family he has constructed in which everyone seems to have changed sex.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para3"></a>I must apologise to the noble Earl for saying in Committee that I was so overwhelmed by his arguments that the Government would bring forward amendments on this matter. However, we have not done so. We have not done so because after very careful reflection&#151;but I am afraid that the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, will need a great deal of persuading on this&#151;we consider that Clause 16 is necessary and that it ought to remain in the Bill. I shall tell the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, why that is so in rather a dull way, I am afraid, which does not match his style and humour. However, it is important that this is put on the record.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para4"></a>Clause 16 states that the issue of a gender recognition certificate does not affect the descent of peerages. It has been included so as to exclude the possibility of a person changing gender&#151;I refer to an elder daughter changing gender in these circumstances&#151;in order to leap-frog a sibling and in that way obtain a peerage, dignity or title of honour. If that could occur it would defeat the expectations of the person to whom the peerage would have otherwise descended. Peerages are also unique because they descend to the eldest son, according to birth. That is another reason why birth gender should continue to count. The adoption and children act of 1992 makes a similar exception, about which the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, may have waxed eloquently 13 years ago. The exception is there so that the adopted children may not inherit a peerage, even if they qualify&#151;as, for example, the eldest son.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para5"></a>I can see from the expression on the face of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, that he does not think that my argument is impressive. But it is our argument and we have considered his comments in Committee. Perhaps my noble friend Lord Filkin and I can have a meeting with the noble Earl so that we can sit down and avoid&#151;if we wish to avoid&#151;a brilliant performance from him at the next stage or perhaps we should just wait and enjoy his comments when we discuss the matter again. I can see out the back of my head the expression on the face of my noble friend Lord Filkin. Seriously, the noble Earl made some interesting points and we would like to discuss them with him over the next week or so&#151;even if I have to do that myself.

<A NAME="40203-26_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, may I interrupt the noble Lord for half a moment? I am amazed that he could see what his noble friend Lord Filkin was saying and thinking, since he was sitting behind him. He must have eyes in the back of his head, like a chameleon. My real concern is that he said I had waxed eloquent over a matter some 13 years ago. I do not wax eloquent over many issues, but I do over some. There are so many matters, that I cannot remember my actual comments 13 years ago. I am deeply impressed that the noble Lord did.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   My Lords, I was imagining what the noble Earl may have said&#151;I have not read Hansard to see whether he did contribute. I shall do that first thing in the morning. I am taking the matter extremely seriously. Before I move away from the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, I wish to say that although his comments were amusing, he made some serious points and I would like to make a valiant attempt to convince him that the clause should stay in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para6"></a>Amendment No. 103, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, raises the issue of forms of address. The noble Baroness also raised the issue in Committee. It was never the intention that a Knight Commander who became a woman in the eyes of the law should continue to style herself as "Sir". But the noble Baroness has raised a valid point&#151;and I hope that I am not upsetting the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, by acknowledging that&#151;about whether a Peer or the holder of another title can legitimately swap it when his or her gender changes in law.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para7"></a>In fact, all of us are in the gift of Her Majesty. She, alone, can confer a title and she, alone, can alter the form of address that a holder uses. However, that does not mean that an amendment to the Bill is necessary. The Government have, since Committee, consulted the Palace and the Garter Principal King of Arms. We are in agreement that the best way to proceed in such rare cases&#151;I underline "rare"&#151;would be for the holder of the title to petition Her Majesty to ask that she change the form of address. There is a wide range of circumstances under which an individual may wish to adopt a different form of address as a result of the Bill. In addition to transsexual people themselves, the former or future spouse of a transsexual person may have a claim on a courtesy title.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para8"></a>Legislating for this multitude of circumstances would seem disproportionate given the very low frequency with which the situation would arise. It would also reduce Her Majesty's prerogative powers in this area. Accordingly, the Government are satisfied that the right to petition Her Majesty, which already exists and will continue to do so, is a sufficient and proportionate method of dealing with the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-26_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, this has been an extremely illuminating debate and I am deeply grateful to my noble friend Lord Ferrers for, as I suspected, illustrating the fact that he knows more about peerages <P>


<a name="column_652"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 652</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>than I do. It is a knotty problem and one which I am glad we have raised. The Government need to resolve it.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para9"></a>I join my noble friend in regretting that there is no clear amendment to the Bill to deal with the problem. However, I recall that during Grand Committee I looked to the officials with considerable sympathy, given their task of coming up with a solution in time for the Report stage. I take my hat off to them and to the Minister for turning to Garter Principal King of Arms and the Palace for their support in their search for the solution.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para10"></a>While the Minister's proposal seems convoluted, it is fair to say that for those who will have to go through the difficult and lengthy process of gender recognition, this final phase for a tiny number of individuals will not be viewed as particularly arduous. It surprised me that the Bill would necessitate involving Her Majesty. I wonder whether that is why it was not even mentioned in the gracious Speech. Perhaps if it had, it might have caused some disturbance at that stage. It seems an enormous length to go to in turning to Her Majesty to change a form of address.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para11"></a>That said, I suspect that this is the best and most practical solution that could be found. Like all noble Lords, I accept that we are talking about a tiny number of individuals in the years to come&#151;perhaps none at all, who knows? I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate, including the noble Lord, Lord Monson, and my noble friend Lord Ferrers, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Unfortunately, during the Committee stage he said that the Government would have to think about these things and I had hoped that he would come up with some answers. I believe that the proper thing would be to have a Division in order to discover what people really feel. We would then know where we were.
<P>

<a name="40203-26_para15"></a>However, I would not wish to disturb the noble Lord, Lord Evans, too much and I think that he had better go away and think about it. Perhaps he could consider the questions I asked and give me some answers. I would not want him to do that first thing tomorrow morning because that would be most disturbing. He has plenty of time to think during the forthcoming Recess. I do not want him to go to any great trouble nor, particularly, to chat me up about it because he might persuade me. But if he would give me the answer on apiece of paper I should be very grateful. I shall not move the amendment.

<a name="40203-27_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "SPORT
<br>
(1) A body responsible for regulating the participation of persons as competitors in an event or events involving a gender-affected sport may, if subsection (2) is satisfied, prohibit or restrict the participation as competitors in the event or events of persons whose gender has become the acquired gender under this Act.
<br>
(2) This subsection is satisfied if the prohibition or restriction is necessary to secure&#151;
<br>
(a) fair competition, or
<br>
(b) the safety of competitors,
<br>
at the event or events.
<br>
(3) "Sport" means a sport, game or other activity of a competitive nature.
<br>
(4) A sport is a gender-affected sport if the physical strength, stamina or physique of average persons of one gender would put them at a disadvantage to average persons of the other gender as competitors in events involving the sport.
<br>
(5) This section does not affect&#151;
<br>
(a) section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (c. 65) (exception from Parts 2 to 4 of that Act for acts related to sport), or
<br>
(b) Article 45 of the Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 (S.I. 1976/1042 (N.I. 15)) (corresponding provision for Northern Ireland)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-27_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the question of sport pre-occupied us for some time in Committee. The Government have introduced an amendment which we hope will solve the legitimate problems raised at that time.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para2"></a>We said in Grand Committee that the Gender Recognition Bill must not lead to a situation in which competition, or the safety of other competitors, is compromised.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para3"></a>We have been of the view that the existing legal framework of the Sex Discrimination Act and Human Rights Act combined provides sporting bodies with the necessary flexibility to deal with the issues raised by transsexual competitors. However, during the debate in Grand Committee I said that we would consider the issue further. Since then, the issue has been discussed between my department&#151;the Department for Constitutional Affairs&#151;the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and UK Sport.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para4"></a>This is a complex area of law. The Government believe that by making express provision in the Bill, sporting bodies will be placed in a better position to formulate clear and lasting frameworks for dealing with the issues raised by transsexual sports people. As your Lordships may know, the International Olympic Committee is also presently looking at the issues raised by transsexual competitors. I understand that it is due to issue guidelines shortly. We will need to ensure that the provisions for sport in the Gender Recognition Bill do not pose a problem for sporting bodies that wish to use the IOC guidelines in the future. The provisions may therefore need to be revisited once the guidelines have been issued. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>in Norway today meeting officials from the Norwegian sports anti-doping agency. From these Benches we would like to express our support for the Government's conversion to our case&#151;a case that my noble friend put forcefully both at Second Reading and in Grand Committee&#151;to exempt competitive sport in the Bill. It now takes a privileged place alongside the monarchy and hereditary Peers.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para5"></a>As it stands, the amendment recognises the strength of argument made by my noble friend and supported in principle by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in Grand Committee to allow governing bodies of sport to continue to determine their criteria for classification, thus preserving fair competition and protecting the safety of competitors, particularly in contact sports. In so doing, the Government are joining us in responding to the representations made to that effect by the Central Council for Physical Recreation, the Sports Council and many governing bodies of sport.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para6"></a>We also support the Government's intention to keep open the possibility of a further amendment during the Bill's proceedings in another place. At the end of this month the International Olympic Committee will be meeting, inter alia, to consider the issue of gender classification. It is possible that its findings may allow Parliament to improve on the wording suggested this evening.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para7"></a>My noble friend Lord Moynihan and I appreciate the sensitivity with which this important issue for sport has been approached by the Minister and his officials since the subject was extensively debated during Second Reading and again in Grand Committee. We thank the Government for listening and are pleased to lend our support to the proposed amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, we welcome the amendment. It follows the solution for which I expressed a preference when speaking in Grand Committee.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-27_para13"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, here is something simpler. Amendments Nos. 110 and 126 have been inspired by the Law Society of Scotland in a further attempt to ensure that the Scottish gender-specific legislation is identified in the Bill. This matter remains as relevant as it was in Grand Committee. The Minister rejected a similar amendment in the fear that at present the list might not be all-inclusive and that future legislation might be needed to add to the list. I remain sufficiently unconvinced to have tabled this amendment. Clarity is an important attribute in legislation.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para14"></a>The Minister is bringing forward an amendment to apply the concept of gender-specific offences to all three legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. Therefore, I look forward to hearing from the Minister the implications of his amendment for Clause 19. I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-27_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I support these amendments. Noble Lords may recall that I proposed similar amendments in Grand Committee, although I sought to amend the wording slightly in the sense that I felt that the list was not entirely adequate. However, I see no harm in having some such list with some expression on the face of the Bill that the list is not exclusive. I believe that having some form of clarity is a good idea.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 110 seeks to insert a list of gender-specific offences into Clause 19 in place of the general definition of gender-specific sex offences that the clause contains at present. The amendment and Clause 19 as presently drafted have the same purpose. The disagreement here is about means and not ends. The problem with using a list&#151;the means proposed by the amendment&#151;is that, if further offences were created or if the definition of existing offences were changed to include or exclude a gender-specific element, the list would require amendment. Although the amendment, taken together with Amendment No. 126, provides for changes in the list, the virtue of using a definition of gender-specific sex offences is still that the need for future amendments is avoided.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para15"></a>Government Amendment No. 131 also relates to Clause 19. At present, Clause 19 extends only to Scotland. However, the law on sex offences in Northern <P>


<a name="column_656"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 656</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ireland remains, to a large extent and in the same way as Scots law, gender specific. As a consequence, the Gender Recognition Bill as drafted will have a disabling impact on the law on sex offences in Northern Ireland&#151;particularly on rape&#151;unless it is amended in a similar fashion to that in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para16"></a>It was originally felt that a temporary lacuna in the law in Northern Ireland might be acceptable, given that a review of Northern Ireland law was in progress and that subsequent legislation would be expected to remove gender-specific crimes from the body of law on sex offences. However, given the straightforward nature of the amendment that will plug the gap in Northern Ireland in the interim period before the new law on sex offences is ready, the Government believe that it is appropriate to take action.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para17"></a>Therefore, I am proposing Amendment No. 131 to adjust the extent of Clause 19 so that it applies throughout the United Kingdom. Although the Sexual Offences Act applying to England and Wales uses gender-neutral terms, this amendment will ensure that no residual problem arises in England and Wales. The Sewel Motion in the Scottish Parliament will take place this Thursday, 5 February.
<P>

<a name="40203-27_para18"></a>I have set out the Government's views on Amendments Nos. 110 and 126. In any case, if the House accepts Amendment No. 131, the list in Amendment No. 110 will be out of date. I would argue that the extent of Clause 19 should be expanded as proposed. In addition, especially in the light of the fact that any list in Clause 19 would have to cover all the criminal jurisdictions in the UK, I would argue that the present definition in Clause 19 provides the better legislative solution.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-28_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, these amendments refer to Clause 21. Amendment No. 113 deals with disclosure in furtherance of the exceptions which are listed in the amendment. Amendment No. 116 deals with the penalties.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para6"></a>Clause 21 is one of the most heavy-handed parts of this Bill. It creates a criminal offence affecting anyone who learns of a person's sex change in an official capacity. If they disclose this information they can be prosecuted and fined up to 5,000.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para7"></a>What is most surprising is that the offence is not limited to civil servants such as people working in the Registrar General's office. It extends to all private employers and, more surprisingly still, to voluntary bodies. If the principal of a Bible college gives a job reference for a former employee, which mentions his change of sex, he is committing a criminal offence. If a church minister tells a church official that a member of the congregation has changed sex, he is also committing a criminal offence. That is really ludicrous.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para8"></a>The fact that a person has had a sex change is, as I have said before, of religious importance. It is a serious ethical issue on a par with lying or adultery. If the church is giving a job reference to another church, it may believe that it is vitally important that the other church knows the truth.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para9"></a>Even if they do not set out to disclose the sex change, they may feel that it is impossible honestly to answer a request for a reference without mentioning it. If the person used to be the woman in charge of ladies' ministries, how would they explain to the new employer how the job was done by a man? Clause 21 compels them to say in the letter that "she" is a "he". It will be a criminal offence to do otherwise.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para10"></a>Many churches, particularly the reformed churches, still operate the practice of requiring a reference from a previous church before accepting someone into membership of that church, not into a job situation, but actual membership on the parochial roll. This too may result in a prosecution. Indeed, it may be that someone will say, "Don't you dare declare it or I will sue". It seems that it would even be an offence to warn a bridegroom if he did not know that his bride-to-be was really a man.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para11"></a>Do the Government see that these are issues of conscience? Do they really want to fine church ministers for refusing to say that a woman is a man? <P>


<a name="column_658"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 658</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Do they not believe that it is wrong to prosecute churchmen for actions which most people would consider perfectly respectable?
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para12"></a>In many places of worship several officials will be involved in decisions about employment or membership. Perhaps only one of them knows that the person has changed sex. If the others favoured the application, he would probably feel compelled by conscience to let them know yet he could be prosecuted for so doing. I ask the Minister this question. If half-a-dozen church elders did discuss the change of sex, would they all be prosecuted or only the one who made the original disclosure? Will there be six fines or just one?
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para13"></a>Amendment No. 113 shows that it is possible to create narrow exceptions to protect religious conscience. We are not talking about protecting gossip here, but disclosure of a serious breach of religious ethics on a need-to-know basis. The same thing happens in politics. If a Government Minister told the Chief Whip that he was secretly donating funds to the Liberal Democrats, the Chief Whip would rightly discuss it with other senior party officials. Why should religious leaders not have a similar liberty of conscience?
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para14"></a>I have another question for the Minister. What if a transsexual applies for a job in any organisation&#151;not necessarily a Church organisation&#151;and is asked for a job history, that is, a cv. The recruiting company wishes to check references and refers to one of the companies on the cv. Large organisations have large human resource directorates, and the people working in those would be aware of the law. But what if you have a small accountancy firm in a small market town, where the person who is the administration manager is the person who deals with job applications, or anything to do with a personnel function? Suppose they have an application from somebody called Janet Jones to join this firm. The cv shows where Janet Jones had worked. One of the organisations is rung up, but the person at the other end of the phone in another small accountancy firm in another town says, "We did not have a Janet Jones working here; we had a James Jones during that period&#151;1989 to 1995." "Are you sure that is James Jones? That must be a mistake. Surely it was Janet Jones."
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para15"></a>Then what? Who is fined? What happens? This is the law of unintended consequences as part of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para16"></a>I have put down Amendment No. 116 to show how harsh the penalty is in Clause 21. Not only would people who disclose this information get a criminal conviction, they could be fined up to 5,000. This is on a par with Section 71 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. It stipulates the same maximum fine for the offence of having sex in a public toilet. This is clearly out of all proportion. I beg to move.

If she feels there are points that I have not answered I will be happy to follow them up in writing, but the hour is late.

<a name="40203-28_para17"></a>Amendment No. 113 deals with marriage. The Bill contains in Schedule 4 a conscience clause which is intended to provide for the situation of ministers of the <P>


<a name="column_659"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 659</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Church of England or the Church in Wales who have a profound difficulty in marrying a person who has been recognised in the acquired gender. The government amendment on this issue has already been presented. Ministers of other religious bodies, as we discussed on the previous day on Report, are not obliged to solemnise marriages.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para18"></a>With regard to the remainder of the amendment from the noble Baroness, this also seeks to provide exemption from the prohibition on disclosure but this time in order to provide religious bodies with the knowledge needed to restrict employment, or membership, or the provision of benefit facilities or services, in such a way as to exclude a person who is recognised in the acquired gender, or who will not consent to the disclosure of any entry relating to him or her contained in the gender recognition register.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para19"></a>There is no need for a further exemption to the disclosure clause for these purposes, when, as we explained in Grand Committee, there are other ways for a religious minister or religious organisation to find out if a person is or is not a transsexual. We are talking about co-believers here. A religious organisation can simply ask the individual concerned, and I find it hard that a co-believer would knowingly lie to a member of the faith on which presumably their life is constructed.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para20"></a>If that notion of "good faith, bad faith" is passably manipulated, none the less it is possible for the religious organisation to acquire this information in a way that prevents even that potentially awkward question and answer session. A Church could, for example, ask to see the person's baptismal certificate. Given that the vast majority of people are baptised before the age of 18, and that no person can change gender before the age of 18, the baptismal certificate would reveal whether a person was transsexual. As I have said, a co-believer should be happy to share this information with a religious organisation that thinks it is important. There are other ways in which such sharing of information could occur discreetly.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para21"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, also raised a question about the level of penalties provided for breach of Clause 21. The effect of her amendment would be that the maximum penalty for breach of Clause 21 would be a 200 fine as opposed to the present maximum of 5,000, which is the upper limit. The precise sentence is for a judge to determine. The amendment would provide that even in a case where disclosure was made maliciously with intent to harm a transsexual person, the maximum penalty would be 200. That hardly seems a sufficient sanction for an act that could cause considerable harm, considerable distress and could become the cause for further acts of discrimination, harassment and abuse.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para22"></a>If the noble Baroness is concerned about the position of people who make a prohibited disclosure inadvertently, clearly that is a matter which the judge would be expected to take into account as part of the deliberations on sentence. Although the harm to the transsexual person would be no less it would be surprising if in those circumstances a judge was to impose a maximum penalty.

<P>

<a name="40203-28_para23"></a>If, instead, the noble Baroness is concerned about disclosures that were made for a legitimate reason, we do not think this is the way to address that concern. Clause 21 already provides for a range of exceptions that seek to describe what counts as legitimate reasons for disclosure. Protected information and worries about criminality are obvious examples. Clause 21 also contains an order-making power for providing further exceptions to be used as and when a need to provide further exceptions is identified in future.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para24"></a>I am not sure whether I have persuaded the noble Baroness, but I have done my best to answer the questions she raised. I hope that as a result she feels able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-28_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. As always, she has been gracious and helpful. I do not disagree with all that she says. A couple of points she made were valid.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para25"></a>The noble Baroness said that this clause concerns marriage. That is right, but I am hooking more issues on to that, as can be seen from the wording of the amendment, to cover other situations. We return to the point in Grand Committee when the noble Baroness referred to good faith, bad faith and co-believers. However, she made a suggestion tonight which I had not thought of and which is very valid; that is, the baptism certificate. I shall take that away and consider it. I am grateful to her for that suggestion.
<P>

<a name="40203-28_para26"></a>The Minister also said that the sentence is for the judge to determine. That did not fill me with a great deal of confidence. Unfortunately, if someone inadvertently discloses information, as in my example of the administration manager of the small market town accountancy firm, that would still result in a criminal offence. I am very concerned that someone should inadvertently find themselves in that situation. It is up to the judge to decide whether or not there is a valid case to answer but that could result in a criminal offence. That worries me. The kind of situation I described could not occur frequently. After all, we are told that there are only 5,000 transsexuals or thereabouts and the chances of them applying for jobs in such accountancy firms are probably remote. However, it could occur and it would be dreadful if the Bill put people in those situations.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-29_para3"></a>The right reverend Prelate said: My Lords, I move this amendment which stands in the name of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester. The amendment relates to the sensitive issue of disclosure of the fact that a person has undergone the gender recognition process under the Bill. When I moved Amendment No. 99, I spoke about appointments, training for ministry or ordination or some other form of authorisation for ministers in Churches or faith communities. That is linked to this amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para4"></a>However, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester also explained in some detail at Committee Stage that the present amendment was needed to ensure that members of religious bodies who are responsible for decisions on those matters can be told in confidence the relevant facts, without the risk of someone committing a criminal offence. Providing safeguards on this is a vital part of safeguarding the Church's right to exercise freedom of conscience in reaching such decisions. That is why this amendment is before your Lordships again today.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para5"></a>We recognise that there are issues of human rights here. Nevertheless, the Minister will appreciate how essential it is to strike a proper balance between the rights of all those concerned. That includes the Churches and faith communities who number transgender persons with deep religious convictions among their members. We ought to be sensitive to their vulnerability.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para6"></a>At Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that if any provision was needed it should be made by regulations. The Church of England would not be opposed, in principle, to taking that approach, if it proved to be the most satisfactory one. Although I cannot speak for other Churches and faith communities, one would expect the same to apply to them. I stress that we are concerned with the need to address some problem areas that present real practical difficulties, as well as issues in principle. So far, the suggestions for overcoming them without legislation seem at best to provide only a partial answer.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para7"></a>That is why before abandoning the possibility of an amendment to the Bill, we need at least some reassurance from the Minister that the Government recognise that there are genuine problems. The discussions between officials, which are already in progress, could continue in their present, constructive spirit, against that background. It is in search of such reassurance that I speak to this amendment in the name of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, most of these issues have already been explored, but I hope that I can address the right reverend Prelate's concerns. We are discussing the position with the <P>

<A NAME="40203-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Marlesford </B>   moved Amendment No. 117:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 21.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-29_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40203-29_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I seek, in moving this amendment, to remove Clause 21 to make this a much better Bill. A number of amendments have been moved that have touched on Clause 21. I have not spoken, except for very briefly, on this Bill before, but I have attended Second Reading, Grand Committee, and Report stage. I have great sympathy for those suffering from gender dysphoria. It is entirely reasonable that those who seek to change or redefine their gender should, after a proper review of their cases, be given official recognition of this fact.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para12"></a>It would have been better for this to have been done through changing administrative procedures, as I understand is done in certain other countries, rather than bringing in a whole Bill for it. It would be a simple procedure to issue a certificate stating that a gender change had been completed. The issuing of a second birth certificate, which would have the same date as the original certificate, would, at the least, be a rather confusing use of government documentation, although the Government will not say that. I was glad to hear on the first day of Report that the original certificate is retained and is available to those who ask for it. The second certificate could be seen as something of a fake.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para13"></a>There are, of course, documents that must be re-issued when they expire&#151;a passport is an obvious example&#151;but those are successor documents that, in no way, purport to be the first and original document issued. I object to the attempt to keep secret the fact that the gender change has been recognised. I use the word "secret" advisedly because Clause 21 makes it a criminal offence to disclose the information. That takes us far beyond the normal considerations of privacy. I am one of those who believe that the civil right to privacy in many situations should be extended.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para14"></a>I recognise that, in cases involving national security, governments must issue false documents to protect intelligence agents and others and, sometimes, police officers. It is also sometimes necessary to create false identities for reasons of witness protection. However, we should hesitate to create fresh criminal offences, with all the attendant implications. We should be sure that they are absolutely necessary. We should remember that the police must enforce such legislation, and they have enough to do already. I am sure that the Minister will say that she anticipates that little police time will be needed, but I would have thought that, as we are not in the business of extending the police further with this Bill, it would be undesirable <P>


<a name="column_663"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>to bring in a new criminal offence. As far as I am aware, Clause 21 is not required by the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para15"></a>Clause 21 goes absurdly wide and is riddled with contradictions, some of which my noble friend Lady O'Cathain referred to. In many ways, it could be unenforceable. In the Explanatory Notes, the paragraph relating to Clause 21 states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the prohibition extends only to information acquired in 'an official capacity' and so does not cover information acquired purely in a private capacity".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-29_para16"></a>
The implication is that civil servants should not be allowed to pass on information that they have acquired in an official policy. Obviously, that is right. It is normal practice and would probably still be covered by the Official Secrets Act 1989 and by the remaining sections of the Official Secrets Act 1911. However, Clause 21 goes far wider than the Explanatory Notes suggest. It covers anyone involved as an employer or prospective employer and anyone involved in "the conduct of business".
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para17"></a>The definition of protected information is information that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"concerns the person's gender before it becomes the acquired gender".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-29_para18"></a>
As my noble friend pointed out, that could cause tremendous complications for any employer who has a CV for somebody who presents themselves as a prospective employee and wants to check back. It creates questions about the legitimacy of the check. My noble friend Lord Ferrers also gave examples of questions about the extent to which inquiries can be made.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para19"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, said several times last week that information on individuals&#151;an original birth certificate, for example&#151;would normally be available only to close relations. Frankly, society is much wider than that.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para20"></a>We have been told throughout our discussions that some 5,000 people will be affected by the Bill. How many will mind people knowing that they have changed gender? I suspect that many will be so relieved to have received the official recognition that they desire, and which most of us support that they should have, that they will be inclined, to use the recent words of the Home Secretary, to open a bottle and invite their friends round. There are many other medical conditions, such as venereal diseases and psychological conditions, especially those relating to sexual dysfunction or aberration when there are far stronger arguments for secrecy, yet the general acceptance of the right of privacy provides adequate attention.
<P>

<a name="40203-29_para21"></a>In most cases, changed gender will already be well known to friends and neighbours. I cannot see many unconnected private people seeking out information to abuse privacy. In any case, I do not believe that Clause 21, as drafted, will guard against that. I emphasise that the danger of discrimination against people for gender change will be well covered by the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.

<A NAME="40203-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to intervene, but the Companion tells us that visual aids are not allowed in the Chamber. It is very emphatic on that. I apologise if I have spoilt the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, with every respect to the noble Lord, if we were to go down that path, Ministers could not read their briefs. I do not accept that his is a rightful interpretation of the Companion, and I shall proceed as I intended regardless.
<P>

<a name="40203-30_para0"></a>The visual aid which I have, which is rather akin to the visual aids used by Ministers, is nothing more nor less than my birth certificate. I am sorry if the noble Lord does not like birth certificates to be produced in the House, but I shall continue to produce mine.
<P>

<a name="40203-30_para1"></a>I notice on the right hand side, it says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Insert in this margin any notes which appear in the original entry".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-30_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40203-30_para3"></a>If anyone were to seek a copy of my birth certificate, it would be incumbent on the registrar to insert in the margin notes that appeared in the original entry. If I decided that I should change sex and got the approval of the gender recognition panel for a change of gender, a certificate would be issued in which it would be forbidden to insert the notes in the margin. As I said earlier, to which the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, did not allude in his reply, it cautions any person who falsifies any of the particulars on the certificate, or who uses it as true knowing it to be false, and he would be liable to prosecution under the Forgery Act or the Perjury Act.
<P>

<a name="40203-30_para4"></a>The Government should sort out the implications of that before resisting the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Marlesford to delete Clause 21. Plainly they have not thought the matter through. If the Bill is enacted and a new birth certificate is copied, it would not have on it what was on the original. It would therefore be false. It would not be adequate according to the birth certificate which I have, and it would constitute either fraud or perjury. The Government need to think their way through that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, first, I shall comment on the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, before turning to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, hung an issue on an available amendment which essentially is that he believes that any re-registration in the new gender, by virtue of a new birth certificate, is in some way fraudulent and makes one a liar. I believe that is where he comes from. I suspect that there will be absolutely no meeting of minds on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I am saying that in my case the original birth certificate would state that I was <P>


<a name="column_665"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 665</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>born a boy. If I had a change of gender and acquired the appropriate certificate, a new birth would state that I was born a girl. Quite clearly, those two certificates would be in conflict.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-30_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, that is because the noble Lord thinks that the second birth certificate would, in some sense, be a lie because it differed from the first birth certificate. The point is that the second certificate would be a new certificate and not a copy of the original. Therefore, it would be as valid a document as the original birth certificate. That is the position of the Government. I know that the noble Lord does not accept that and that other noble Lords also may not accept it, but that is the whole point of having a new birth certificate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-30_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-30_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I shall defer to the wishes of the House. We can spar, but I am mindful that the House will want, if possible, to complete Report stage tonight. However, if the noble Earl insists on speaking, of course I shall give way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-30_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I do not wish to trouble the noble Baroness any more.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-30_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for his courtesy. I return to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. Changing gender is a difficult process. It is difficult in terms of the person's own identity and in terms of his or her relationship with other people. I believe that we would all accept that respect for a person's private life means that we must alleviate some of the dangers of humiliation, embarrassment and harassment.
<P>

<a name="40203-30_para5"></a>As we have discussed, it is a medical condition whereby a person feels driven to live in the opposite gender. I do not think that being reminded of the original gender, being confronted by it regularly, having others knowing that you suffer from the medical condition and knowing that they might be talking about it, is conducive to feeling secure. I believe that that makes it difficult to live in the acquired gender in dignity.
<P>

<a name="40203-30_para6"></a>That is why the Bill contains protections for the privacy of transsexual people, a privacy that is in accord with ECHR, despite the challenge of the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. We have checked on that. These protections prevent harm to the transsexual person and to his or her family and friends. In turn, do they cause harm to others?
<P>

<a name="40203-30_para7"></a>In Clause 21, as your Lordships have already discussed, there are references to exclusions, crime detection and hearings before courts and tribunals where information of the original birth gender may be properly disclosed. Clause 21 also has another important limit. Not only does it enumerate a list of exceptions that allow disclosure where it is justified in terms of public policy, but it extends only to information that is acquired in an official capacity, as <P>


<a name="column_666"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 666</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, recognises. It does not intrude into the private sphere; it is not for the state to determine what friends may or may not say to each other about another friend or what family members may talk about. The law has limits beyond which ethics alone must suffice. With those remarks, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-30_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, it is late and uncharacteristically the noble Baroness has given a self-contradictory reply. She started off by talking about the importance of Clause 21 which is to ensure that people do not chat or gossip about the situation, so making people feel uncomfortable with having had a gender change. Then she went on to point out that the limitations of Clause 21 would not make the slightest difference to that because it does not involve private people next door to each other who do not come under the limits drawn by Clause 21. Therefore, I go back to my point. Recognising the need for privacy and recognising that there is already provision for privacy under general practices, I found the Minister's answer unconvincing. It is an important issue. The Bill would be greatly improved without the clause, precisely because it meets a danger that is not there and does not meet a danger that the Minister suggested was avoided by it.
<P>

<a name="40203-30_para8"></a>However, it is perhaps a little late in the evening to test the opinion of the House, so, for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40203-30_para25"></a>Clause 25 [Commencement]:
<P>

<a name="40203-30_para26"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 25 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-30_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, when we debated in Grand Committee whether Clause 25 should stand part of the Bill, I expressed my belief that the Bill should not come into force until the civil partnership Bill is enacted. We should have had an opportunity to debate that Bill first, particularly given the difficulty that many noble Lords, including myself, have had with coming to terms with a Bill that requires, in the event of an individual wishing to acquire full gender recognition, that he or she must, if married, go through the process of a divorce or annulment. If the civil partnership Bill does not reach the statute book, those who have divorced in order to acquire full gender recognition will be left in a terrible limbo.
<P>

<a name="40203-30_para27"></a>I am sorry that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester is not in his place because I wanted to take this opportunity to confirm that I do not believe that marriage and civil partnership are the same. Noble Lords may remember from our debate in Grand Committee that the right reverend Prelate was concerned at the suggestion that one could move seamlessly from marriage to a civil partnership arrangement. I would wish to see the process and time frame of moving from one state, marriage, to another, civil partnership, being made as smooth and straightforward as possible. That does not mean that the status of being in a civil partnership is equal to that of marriage.
<P>

<a name="40203-30_para28"></a>I fear that by debating this Bill prior to the publication of a civil partnership Bill we are able only to hope that the latter will be enacted and will contain provisions to allow couples to enjoy some of the legal&#151;I stress, legal&#151;obligations proposed, for example, in the Private Member's Bill that was introduced in 2002 by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, we spoke briefly on these issues last week during the first day of Report. I then put on record that it was the Government's intent to introduce the civil partnership Bill into this House by the end of March. I think that that is the first time that that had been referred to publicly. The consequence of that if, as we hope, it makes sensible progress&#151;I note with gratitude the expression of support from the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, to that effect&#151;is that this Bill should go live in April 2005 and the civil partnership Bill would go live in about October 2005, some six months later.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para0"></a>In short, a transsexual person who was married and wished to have their acquired gender recognised in law would be able, if they wished, to move ahead forthwith. Alternatively, if they wished to avail themselves of the very simple transition that we believe we have identified&#151;from the married status through divorce to civil partnership, the final stages of which <P>


<a name="column_668"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 668</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we believe could be done in one day&#151;they could wait until then. Therefore, they are in control of whether they move ahead forthwith or stay in their position.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para1"></a>That is a decent choice, but it is not a good reason for not proceeding with allowing transsexual people who are married and do not wish to wait until the civil partnership provision is in place to avail themselves of the legal opportunity as soon as possible or, indeed, the vast majority of transsexual people who are single.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para2"></a>I am with the noble Baroness in terms of intent&#151;we want this process to be as quick as possible. If the gap is only six months, that is excellent. We have made the transition process as short and simple as possible&#151;it can be as short as one day. People are in control of what they do. We feel this is the best possible situation, recognising that the two pieces of legislation cannot be synchronised exactly. I hope, with that explanation on the record, the noble Baroness will not press the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-31_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. I do not want to detain the House tonight, but I believe the Government should accept that it is wrong in principle to introduce one Bill, encourage noble Lords to support it and see it through to the statute book, before a Bill such as the civil partnership measure, which is of great importance to this Bill, is passed.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para3"></a>The provisions of the civil partnership Bill will, as we understand it, enable those who have to go through this really difficult process of divorce to be able to move to another form of legal status such as a civil partnership. However, I believe the Government have got it wrong; they have introduced the wrong Bill at the wrong time. The Government should have introduced the civil partnership Bill, seen it through and then, assuming that it makes it on to the statute book, introduce this very difficult Gender Recognition Bill that requires noble Lords to accept the notion that there must be a divorce or annulment if an individual wants to have full gender recognition when that individual is married and is changing gender.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para4"></a>As I have said, I do not want to detain noble Lords tonight, but I believe this is a matter of principle. However, I will not press the Question.

<br>
section 2(1)(b) has effect as if for "two" there were substituted "six".
<br>
(2) Subsections (3) and (4) apply in the case of an application to which subsection (1B) applies and in the case of an application&#151;
<br>
(a) made during the rest of the initial period,
<br>
(b) based on the applicant having or having had gender dysphoria, and
<br>
(c) including a statutory declaration by the applicant that the applicant has lived in the acquired gender throughout the period of six years ending with the date on which the application is made."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-31_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, expressed the view in Committee that six months might be too short a time, taking into account the fact that some transsexual people may not become aware of the simplified procedure or that there might be extraneous circumstances outside their control which prevent them applying within the period.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para8"></a>In considering the noble Lord's arguments, I also considered a situation in which a married transsexual person who will have to end the marriage before he or she acquires full recognition may wish to wait for civil partnership legislation to come into effect so the relationship can be put back on a legal footing almost immediately. I am therefore proposing that the simplified procedure should be available for the first two years of the operation of the gender recognition panels. That should provide sufficient time for a transsexual person to find out about the process, prepare an application and make all the necessary arrangements, especially where a spouse or children of the family are involved.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para9"></a>The simplified procedure will be exclusive for the first six months. It is only fair that applications from those transsexual people who have lived in the acquired gender for a long time have their applications dealt with first. For a further 18 months the simplified procedure will run alongside the standard application procedure.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para10"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Carlile of Berriew, Amendment No. 130, seeks to make the provisions in <P>


<a name="column_670"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column 670</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 26 available to any person who is able to satisfy the panel that he or she was entitled to apply on those provisions in the first two years of the operation of the panels but has a reasonable explanation for not doing so. I am concerned as to how the panel would be expected to exercise the discretion that is proposed. The amendment provides no guidance on what would constitute a reasonable explanation. The amendment would add discretionary aspects to the panel's deliberations and would decrease the simplicity and clarity of the panel's work. I also wonder whether the amendment would make the panel unduly vulnerable to challenge when exercising its discretion in this matter.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para11"></a>I am convinced that the government amendment that I have outlined is an uncomplicated solution that addresses the concerns raised in Committee and those of the noble Lords whose amendment is before us today. It is unclear what further advantage their amendment would bring. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. I put forward two amendments in Committee. One was to extend the fast-track period from six months to 12 months; the second was to allow discretionary applications to be made after the end of the 12-month period. The Government now propose to extend the fast-track period to not one year but two years. I regard that as adequate and I shall therefore not seek to move the amendment calling for a further discretionary extension.

 "APPLICATION OF THE 1965 ACT TO NORTHERN IRELAND

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-31_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 103A seeks to correct some anomalies in Northern Ireland legislation. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides that nuclear energy and installations are excepted matters. The Act made no consequential amendments to the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and, as a result, there are provisions in the 1965 Act which are now inconsistent with the Northern Ireland Act. Consequently, the purpose of this group of amendments is to amend such provisions in the 1965 Act to reflect the devolution settlement in the 1998 Act.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para21"></a>The amendments to Sections 3(1A) and (6A), 4(3A) and 5(1A) of the 1965 Act extend the consultation requirements in respect of a nuclear site licence to Northern Ireland in the event that a licence is granted there. At present, these consultation requirements apply only in respect of a nuclear site licence in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para22"></a>Section 27 of the 1965 Act deals with the application of certain provisions to Northern Ireland. The effect of this section is to substitute references with a UK meaning with references within the context of Northern Ireland&#151;for example, the substitution of "Minister" with "Minister of Commerce for Northern Ireland" and so on. However, in light of the 1998 Act, most of the provisions in Section 27 are now otiose. Consequently the amendment repeals those provisions in Section 27 and updates the provisions that are still required to reflect the devolution settlement.
<P>

<a name="40203-31_para23"></a>In preparing the amendments we consulted with the relevant Northern Ireland authorities and they have been agreed. I hope the Committee will accept them. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-32_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I wish to ask the Minister only one question. It may very well be that my question will show that I am ignorant of the whole situation in regard to Northern Ireland. The Minister said that this is to reflect the devolution settlement, which we understand needs to be done. Can he tell us for the record what effect the present constitutional hiatus&#151;which has been caused by the suspension of the legislative assembly and devolved government&#151;will have on the amendment, given that the situation is rather fluid at the moment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The Ministers currently operating in Northern Ireland during the suspension of the Assembly are appointed by the UK Government but are working under Northern Ireland legislation. It is therefore the later Northern Ireland legislation that determines their scope for action, and it is that which is inconsistent with the earlier Act.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-32_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 104, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 105. Amendment No. 104 simply seeks to add a subsection to the expenditure clause of the Bill; Amendment No. 105 is the substantive amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para4"></a>There has been a widespread recognition both inside and outside the House that the steady fall in the number of undergraduate and postgraduate students studying nuclear related courses&#151;in particular full time courses for nuclear science and nuclear engineering&#151;will, if it is not reversed, create serious difficulty for the NDA, its regulators and other agencies. In particular, if it is not speedily reversed, the credibility of the Government's aim to keep open the nuclear option will be further eroded.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para5"></a>Although the building of new nuclear stations and power stations will require the services primarily of civil, mechanical and electrical engineers, those who design and commission such stations will need the services of many skilled specialist nuclear scientists and engineers. It has been remarked in many quarters that the professional workforce of the present operators is ageing, with most professional grade staff already over the age of 40.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para6"></a>When I raised this matter in the House the other day I referred to the number of constituencies&#151;around about 80&#151;which have nuclear installations in them, and to the number of full-time staff working in those various installations, about 60,000.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para7"></a>I contrasted that with the fact that there are now no full-time undergraduate courses at our universities for nuclear scientists or engineers, and only one full-time postgraduate course, which is at Birmingham University. The reaction in the House was quite stark. To many noble Lords, that seemed a startling state of affairs that justified giving rise to anxiety.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para8"></a>Last June, I tabled a Written Question on the availability of courses. I received a Written Answer&#151;as reported at col. WA 42 of Hansard for 26 June 2003&#151;from the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, at the education department. She gave a long list of places with postgraduate courses, but had to admit that at that time no universities were offering undergraduate courses specifically in nuclear science and engineering.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para9"></a>It quickly became clear to me that, even as regards the postgraduate courses, that was a very misleading Answer. I asked the noble Baroness's office where I could pursue the issue of those courses. From where did her department obtain the information? It came from the Health and Safety Executive, under which the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate now operates.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para10"></a>My inquiries made it clear that the vast majority of postgraduate courses are very part-time modules; some are for perhaps only a few hours a week for one term. I am happy to pay tribute to Dr Peter Storey, head of the research and radiation unit at the HSE, based in Bootle, for giving me much of the information that I shall convey to the Grand Committee.
<P>


<a name="column_GC286"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC286</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para11"></a>I also tabled further Written Questions in July and received Written Answers&#151;reported in Hansard at col. WA 94 on 1 July and at cols. WA 110 and WA 111 on 2 July. I merely refer to those and do not quote them. They do not give any more information than Dr Storey has been kind enough to give me. I refer to them simply as evidence that I have been pursuing the issue for some time.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para12"></a>Dr Storey sent me various reports. I said that the reply from the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, was misleading. It was also considerably out of date, being based on information that went back to 2001. Dr Storey was, first, able to give me an update on nuclear education at British universities dated December 2003. Apparently that information will shortly appear on the relevant website.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para13"></a>The list Dr Storey gave was quite interesting. I imagine that the universities are in no particular order. New teaching within the nuclear area at the University of Cambridge has been introduced in the form of a module on electricity and the environment within the MPhil in technology policy. The nuclear content of that degree is about 3 per cent. The City University does rather better. The MSc in energy and environmental technology and economics now has two new nuclear elements. The noble lord, Lord Whitty, will be pleased to hear that one is decommissioning&#151;50 per cent nuclear and 50 per cent offshore&#151;and the other is risk analysis for management. Companies such as British Energy, BNFL, UKAEA and the NII provide lecturers for the course.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para14"></a>UHI, which will become the University of Highlands and Islands when it achieves university status in 2007, will collaborate with universities abroad&#151;in particular, the Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble and the National Institute for Nuclear Sciences and Technology in France, the CEA's training and education arm&#151;in an initiative to establish common standards for a vocational and academic training in decommissioning. In Imperial College, the radiochemistry laboratory, which dates back to 1971, has now been completely refurbished. However, the counting equipment, which dates from the 1980s, still awaits updating.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para15"></a>I shall not go through the whole list. The Victoria University of Manchester is developing a proposed MSc in nuclear engineering and continues in line to offer the course from September 2004. Project Dalton involves the university, the North-West Development Agency and BNFL in establishing a new institution at Manchester focused on nuclear science and engineering. The report states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Although primarily linked to nuclear decommissioning and clean up, Dalton will also create links with other areas, such as fusion and nuclear medicine".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-32_para16"></a>
I pause to remind the Committee that when we discussed research, it was remarked that there was currently no research under way in nuclear fission and all the Government's effort was going into fusion, which may be some decades off.
<P>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC287</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para17"></a>Other institutions are mentioned in an update of the Answers of the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland. We also briefly discussed the question of collaboration in Europe. The European Nuclear Engineering Network is a fifth framework initiative involving 22 universities from 17 EU or candidate countries that aims to harmonise nuclear curricula in Europe and develop a European postgraduate masters course in nuclear engineering. Unsurprisingly, Britain is represented by Birmingham University, which, as I said, runs the only postgraduate course in nuclear engineering. So there are things going on, and we should say so and acknowledge what is happening.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para18"></a>A short while ago, I mentioned Imperial College. At a recent conference I met Professor Hewitt of Imperial College, who told me something about and sent me details of the introduction to nuclear technology that is a third or fourth-year option course offered by the college. As one might have suspected, it turns out to be an afternoons-only course for one day a week&#151;Tuesday afternoons from 20 January through to 3 March&#151;covering an interesting list of subjects but, as Professor Hewitt states in his covering note to me:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Our course is a modest effort compared to what is needed at, say, MSc level to give an in-depth training".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-32_para19"></a>
He continues&#151;the Minister will welcome this point&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"but the response [to] higher level courses has been insufficient to allow them to continue".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<a name="40203-32_para21"></a>There is some evidence that the publication of the Government's White Paper on decommissioning has sparked some interest in students thinking there might be a good opportunity for future employment, but it is still very small. Professor Hewitt is saying that, as a result of what has been said by the Government&#151;indeed, one might say as a result of what is in the Bill, and certainly in the White Paper&#151;to the vast majority of students, many of whom will study chemistry or engineering at undergraduate level, the nuclear industry appears to be a dying industry. Is it surprising that a young man or woman looking for a career with long-term potential might turn away from it?
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para22"></a>I find all that very worrying. Dr Storey gave me a very interesting report about what had gone on in the past. It is quite clear that despite the apparent disincentives and the lack of interest on the part of Ministers, certainly until quite recently, other government agencies that need the services of trained graduate and postgraduate nuclear scientists and engineers have become increasingly concerned. Many have taken steps to do something about the problem. In February 2001, there was a nuclear education forum, of which I have been sent details, but I do not need to weary the Committee with those details. Its detailed proceedings are available to anyone who wants to pursue them.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para23"></a>There was an OECD report in 2000, to which I referred briefly at Second Reading, entitled Nuclear Education and Training&#151;Causes for Concern?, which was based on an extensive survey of 16 OECD member states including the UK. For the UK it states that, <P>


<a name="column_GC288"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC288</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unless action is taken, the prospects of maintaining a nuclear education capability for the future are not good. A brief summary of the report states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The possible implications of a decline in nuclear education and teaching arise because the future safe operation of the nuclear facilities in the UK is in part dependent on the continued availability of appropriate skills and expertise".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-32_para24"></a>
That was the central point of the passage to which I referred at Second Reading. We cannot expect to be able to operate safely and effectively unless we have the trained staff to be able to do that. It is extremely worrying that there seems to be so much doubt about the continued attractiveness and availability of such courses.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para25"></a>I said a few moments ago that there is some evidence that, although the publication of the White Paper about decommissioning has stimulated some increased interest to most young people contemplating where their career ambitions lie, the nuclear industry is not seen to have a future. The industry is doing what it can. BNFL, a leading firm in the industry, has established a centre of excellence at Manchester University, but it tells me that without more government encouragement it is proving an uphill task. I could go on, but I have said enough on the problems that the country faces as we move into this century, and the tasks that need to be done if we are to be able to deal with the matter sensibly.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para26"></a>Only this morning, I was able to lay my hands on a copy of the DTI's Consultation paper on proposals for intermediate level radioactive waste substitution. The consultants happen to be an American firm, but I make no quarrel about that, as there was a perfectly good competitive tendering process. In the very long report they recommended almost exactly what the Science and Technology Committee of this House, under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, who knows more about the subject than all of us put together, recommended&#151;that the Government should get ahead with substitution, and that it is a question of what you import, what you must re-export and so on. The consultants gave a very clear endorsement of what we said. Without attribution, that is how such things go. It could not possibly be done if one did not have the trained manpower who could understand the complicated nuclear science involved in judging whether it is right to take in more intermediate-level waste and instead to export high-level waste back to the countries where it is generated, or to stay where we are. I mention that in passing.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para27"></a>Perhaps there is a glimmer on the horizon. I have been given to understand that the Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir David King, is leading a study of the problem. One has read almost nothing about that&#151;at least I have not, although I try to follow the subject fairly closely&#151;so I have a series of questions to put to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. Who is taking part in this study? Will it produce a report, and when? Will the report be published? Is this area of nuclear education on the agenda of the sustainable energy policy network (SEPN), which was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, in two Written Answers to me on <P>


<a name="column_GC289"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC289</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>12 January 2004? The noble Lord said that all the departments concerned may be involved in the work of the SEPN.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para28"></a>Is that body looking at the question of nuclear education and training, particularly at higher education level? I am told that some 18 government departments and agencies make up the SEPN. How many people attend SEPN meetings? Perhaps I should submit a Question on the matter, but it has been suggested that it may be 120 people. It is not a decision-making body; it is a sort of Parliament. Is that the way to carry forward such a highly technical subject, or is it delegated to smaller groups? I hope that the Minister can tell us more of the SEPN's role. In particular, I hope that he can throw more light on the study being undertaken by the Chief Scientific Adviser. Knowing Sir David King well, I have considerable faith in his ability and seriousness; after all, he is one of the most outspoken government officials, who has made no secret of his view that there will have to be a new nuclear build. He deserves credit for that.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para29"></a>Amendment No. 105 would require the Government to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"establish and maintain a register of nuclear scientists, engineers and technicians currently working . . . and of those being trained and graduating . . . in relevant courses in British universities or elsewhere in the United Kingdom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-32_para30"></a>
That puts the responsibility for that important subject firmly on the shoulders of the Government. They need to satisfy the country that they are taking the necessary action about a situation that threatens our nuclear future.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para31"></a>The second part of the amendment requires the Government to maintain and publish a comprehensive programme of research, with particular reference to designs of new nuclear power stations and technology right across the world. We dealt with the subject of research on an amendment tabled by my noble friend Lady O'Cathain earlier in the proceedings of the Grand Committee, and I certainly do not intend to return to that at any length. However, I must say that we still await a clear statement on the further measures that Mr Stephen Timms&#151;the Minister who counts energy as one of his many responsibilities&#151;told the energy choices committee in December were to be expected, with 5 million widely regarded as quite inadequate.
<P>

<a name="40203-32_para32"></a>Amendment No. 105 is intended entirely seriously. The Government have to recognise their responsibilities in terms of both trained scientific and engineering manpower for the future, and making sure that the country keeps properly up to date and able to deal with new nuclear designs and technology as it becomes available. I hope that we shall get a rather stronger answer than we have had from Ministers so far on the subject, because it is one of huge importance. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-33_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   As a complete amateur on this subject, I would like not only to support the <P>


<a name="column_GC290"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC290</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment, but to say that I think that we are discussing the nub of the whole Bill. The Government, for understandable reasons up to a point, have been so taken over by their public relations that they are in fact failing the nation in a number of ways at present on quite serious and important fronts. Some of that is being discussed in the Chamber at the moment, but we are talking about energy.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para0"></a>It is quite clear from the statistics and the discussions so far at Second Reading and in Committee&#151;it will become clearer as we go through the next part of the Bill&#151;that the importance of wind and wave power is completely subsidiary to what my noble friend has talked about. The public relations of the Government are causing them to get us all diverted on to discussing wind power ad nauseam. People are very interested in it, of course, because it comes near their homes and so on. However, the truth is that there is an urgent need to begin to get new nuclear power off the ground in this country. We need nuclear build, to develop the technologies for the safest possible nuclear build, and we need the people to do it.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para1"></a>My noble friend made a rather long speech, and people may have thought it a bit long. I do not believe that it was a bit too long. In fact, he identified in rather a shocking way the level of effort going into the training of nuclear scientists, engineers and technicians at present. It is rather small. People will not want to embark on a career if they do not think that there will be jobs at the end, and they cannot tell whether there are. All they know about is decommissioning, windmills, sea power and so on. They cannot be certain about nuclear power, and yet it is inevitable&#151;we all know that in our heart of hearts. All we do is talk about keeping the nuclear option open. If we do not look out, we will still be doing that when the lights go out. So what my noble friend said is important. I do not know whether including an amendment such as this in the Bill is the right way to proceed; the important thing is that the Government should be responsible for ensuring that our academic institutions have the confidence to set up courses and that people have the confidence to apply to go on them. The amendment is very important. I hope that the Government are not just going to talk to us about keeping the nuclear option open, because that is becoming a joke.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, has raised an important issue of energy policy. I shall concentrate more specifically on expertise in decommissioning, with which the Bill specifically deals, and ask the Minister whether he considers that Clause 7(1)(d), which refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"educating and training persons about those matters"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-33_para2"></a>
namely, decommissioning&#151;gives adequate emphasis to the important task that lies ahead in that area. That does not cover the whole range of nuclear activity to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred, but it is specifically relevant to the Bill. I should like to know <P>


<a name="column_GC291"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC291</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether that rather loose wording is adequate for the important task of training in decommissioning involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-33_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My noble friend Lady Carnegy was right when she said that the amendment gets to the nub of the matter. The Government continually tell us that they are keeping the nuclear option open, and I restrict my words in that manner, so I do not go as far as my noble friend. If the Government are serious about keeping the nuclear option open, it is clear that people must be studying and achieving in that field to do all those jobs.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para3"></a>I totally agree with my noble friend when she said that she did not think that the speech of my noble friend Lord Jenkin was one word too long. In fact, as I listened to the research that he has performed over many years and the depths to which he has gone to find out about all the courses&#151;how some are just part time or one day a week, and so on&#151;and putting the matter into context, I thought that no one sitting in Committee could fail to have been impressed, but also worried about the lack of facilities that he discussed.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, referred to Clause 7, which restricts the matter that my noble friend discussed to what the NDA can do in research, education and so on. He referred to Clause (7)(1)(d), which mentions,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"educating and training persons about those matters".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-33_para5"></a>
That wording is loose and it will be interesting to hear what the Minister says about that. I am looking in two directions because I am not sure which Minister will reply.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para6"></a>Paragraph (a) of that subsection states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"carrying out research into matters relating to the decommissioning of nuclear installations, the cleaning-up of nuclear sites and the other activities in relation to which it has functions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-33_para7"></a>
I am interested to know what are those other activities. Does the Minister think that Amendment No. 105, which mentions courses, would provide sufficient training for people to perform all the tasks that are duties of the NDA? I am now talking in a narrower sense than the larger one to which my noble friend Lady Carnegy referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Tombs: </B>   I think that this amendment goes to the heart of maintaining the nuclear option. For that reason it is crucial.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para8"></a>I should like to make two detailed points. First, subsection (1) of Amendment No. 105 says that the Secretary of State will,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"maintain a register of nuclear scientists, engineers and technicians currently working in the field of nuclear power".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-33_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40203-33_para10"></a>In practice, most of the work done in nuclear power&#151;whether it be building, operating, decommissioning nuclear power stations or providing for long-term or intermediate-term storage&#151;is done by civil, mechanical, electrical and control engineers with a nuclear knowledge; not by narrowly trained nuclear engineers. That of course does not negate the need for a nuclear facility in the higher education system. However, I think that the provision would be <P>


<a name="column_GC292"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC292</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>greatly improved if the word "nuclear" were removed from the second line of subsection (1), so that it read, "a register of scientists, engineers and technicians currently working in the field of nuclear power".
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para11"></a>My second detailed point concerns the second line of subsection (3) of Amendment No. 105, where there is a reference to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a comprehensive programme of research to identify designs of new nuclear power stations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-33_para12"></a>
There is no need to identify it; everyone who has developed one is publicising it for all they are worth. What is needed is scientific research to appraise them, to look at them critically and to look at their advantages and disadvantages. That would be a very fruitful and a very necessary field, which was certainly part of the process in the bad old days before privatisation.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para13"></a>Quite apart from the points that the proposed new clause makes about a shrinking specialist force of manpower to maintain the declared option, it is necessary also to concentrate Ministers' minds in an area to which I think they have so far given scant attention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I think that we are in a little difficulty. First, it is difficult to see how the amendment fits into the structure of the Bill; it goes well beyond the structure outlined at the beginning. Secondly, it is difficult to try to disentangle many noble Lords' desire for a significant new nuclear component of energy provision from the Government's position of keeping open the nuclear option. Much of what has been said&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, was particularly explicit about this&#151;has been in support of a bigger nuclear programme. That clearly would require all sorts of significant skills and significant research, most of which would be funded, one assumes in today's circumstances, by the commercial providers of such power. Keeping the nuclear option open requires us to keep a reasonable level of expertise&#151;both nuclear engineers in the proper sense and expertise in the other required skills&#151;to ensure that we have sufficient technical advice to mobilise should a situation arise where we need new nuclear build.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, raised a number of questions. Perhaps I should start with the strategic one of who takes decisions on all of this. He asked about the sustainable energy policy network. I think that the Committee should recognise that a whole structure was established as a result of the energy White Paper. The decision-making body is the ministerial group, established under the joint chairmanship of Patricia Hewitt and Margaret Beckett, which covers all government departments. That is the decision-making body and is supported by a sustainable energy policy board that also includes experts.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para15"></a>There is also a wider network which is mobilised to feed in to that advice. The whole network meets roughly quarterly and has about 50 participants. That is not the decision-making body and was never intended to be. However, it does cover issues such as what skills are required to deliver the energy policy as a whole. There are training and research requirements <P>


<a name="column_GC293"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC293</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in fields other than nuclear power, including renewables, energy efficiency and the delivery of other streams of the energy policy and so forth.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para16"></a>As regards nuclear power itself, the amendments deal with the issues of both training and research. Let me concentrate first on the issue of training. It remains the case&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, may believe that some of the expertise is a little on the elderly side&#151;that a significant part of energy expertise in this country is still nuclear based and that there is a high level of the nuclear engineers and other support engineers required. In terms of the amount of expertise around, nuclear power is not short of expertise.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para17"></a>It is important that we maintain that expertise. Two years ago, the Government conducted a wide-ranging nuclear and radiological skills report, which was finalised in December 2002. That report indicated that we have an established stock of expertise and that there was no immediate problem, but that action was needed to avoid a future decline. It was in response to that report that the Government have assisted in the establishment of sector skills councils to represent the needs of the nuclear industry and that level. The Cogent Sector Skills Council, which is expected to be licensed shortly, will take a strategic view of the nuclear sector to ensure that the education and training base can meet the nuclear employers' current and future needs. As the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, indicated, that is not only in terms of the nuclear engineers required, but also in terms of chemical, electrical and other engineers.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para18"></a>That, of course, does not immediately translate into undergraduate courses. It is unlikely that we will have many undergraduate courses in nuclear engineering as such. Therefore the modular approach, about which the noble Lord was at times disparaging, must be part of the approach to training at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para19"></a>The Cogent Sector Skills Council currently represents the chemical, oil and gas sectors. There are many synergies in the various engineering and scientific skills and the nuclear sector. Once licensed, it will operate through a mix of sector skills development agencies and other industrial funding.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para20"></a>As to the nuclear skills group, to which the noble Lord referred, the prospect of the NDA being established has already in the decommissioning area spurred other skills initiatives by a number of authorities, as the noble Lord acknowledged. Cogent has been actively engaged in this. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and others referred to some examples. The North West Development Agency is funding a nuclear skills project to support the siting of the NDA in the North West. Its main thrust is to develop a national nuclear academy, linking schools, vocational training centres and higher education institutions. While the focus will be on decommissioning skills, later stages of the project will enable all aspects of the nuclear sector to be considered.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para21"></a>The noble Lord referred to Project Dalton, which concerns the merger of Victoria Manchester University and the Manchester Institute of <P>


<a name="column_GC294"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC294</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Technology. This has led to a project funded by BNFL to forge collaboration among higher education institutes. Energy Foresight is working to develop educational material to support radiation related modules in the revisions to the 2005 schools curriculum. Some of the funding for that is provided by the North West Development Agency.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para22"></a>The noble Lord also referred to the University of Highlands and Islands and the UKAEA, which have signed up to a more international development with the French Nuclear Energy Agency and the University of Grenoble to collaborate on nuclear skills. At European level there is the establishment of the nuclear fission research consortia.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para23"></a>So education and skills development is being substantially backed by the Government in order to enable us to engage in both the decommissioning clean-up and the management of nuclear waste. We are also keeping open the option of a further nuclear contingent in future energy plans should the present strategy prove that we could not manage without new nuclear build. But even without new nuclear build, based on all projections, nuclear energy will continue to play a significant part in the delivery of electricity in this country well into the next two or three decades&#151;certainly into the 2030s. We will therefore need to continue to develop those skills. The management of nuclear waste will take place well beyond that period.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para24"></a>Therefore, we accept the need to ensure that a level of skills is available. However, the amendment requires the establishment of a register of such skills, a unique proposal that relates narrowly to nuclear scientists rather than all the skilled people that will be required. To some extent, it could represent an unnecessary level of bureaucracy and possibly even a restraint on people with a mix of skills who are not on the register from entering the industry. Companies involved in the industry may not necessarily welcome such a register.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para25"></a>The amendment also deals with a funding issue that would not be appropriate for inclusion in this legislation. The noble Lord and others have said that 5 million&#151;the research council's component of nuclear research&#151;is insufficient, but it would be unusual for the Bill to determine the level or structure of expenditure on research. It is true that the level of nuclear research over the past years has reduced significantly. It is not a particularly recent development; it certainly does not relate to the energy White Paper or to this Government. The main drop in nuclear research followed the assessment made in the early 1990s and the statement made by Tim Eggar when he was Energy Minister. Effectively, he said that the bulk of research ought to be financed by the industry itself.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para26"></a>This Government have also taken that position, while recognising their responsibilities to provide higher education and to keep an element of research going through the research councils and elsewhere. However, both the publicly and privately owned components of the nuclear energy industry must be the main funders of research, rather than central <P>


<a name="column_GC295"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC295</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>government funds. That is why in Clause 7 we have placed a responsibility for both research and training on the NDA, and existing responsibilities and activities are conducted by BNFL, UKAEA and the private sector in the field.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para27"></a>As I have emphasised several times, the nuclear provisions of the Bill deal with the establishment of the NDA. That is why the NDA's functions are highlighted in the clause to which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, drew attention. It does not cover the totality of research or training that would be required from the nuclear sector. It is a function of the new body established by the legislation, and it seems to give that agency adequate powers to carry out the research and training necessary to sustain the level of expertise needed.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para28"></a>I recognise Members' concerns, and the fact that, along with the private sector and the public authorities in the nuclear sector, the Government have some responsibility to help maintain a level of expertise and research. Some of the research requirements proposed in the amendment are not really necessary. I think that I heard the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, rightly say that if anyone is thinking of nuclear build in the next 10 years, the designs and technologies available are pretty well known; we do not need additional research on that. If we were to carry out research in that period, we would already know what kind of designs were available and the benefits or otherwise and costs of nuclear power stations. If we reverted to a larger nuclear component, the need for wider research may become apparent. Keeping the nuclear option open requires a certain level of skills and research, but it does not require a sledgehammer to crack it; nor does it require the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, or the register proposed in Amendment No. 105.
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para29"></a>I am not inclined, even on the narrow issue of keeping the nuclear option open, to agree with the noble Lord's amendment. On the wider issue, the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, may be right: the nub of the difficulty between many Members of the Committee and the Government's position is that we do not at present see a significant role for nuclear energy; we are not closing the door on it, but it is not government policy. Therefore, one would hardly expect the Government to seize on skills and research requirements that flow from an alternative policy and include them in the Bill.

<A NAME="40203-33_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I think that the Minister said that the Government see no need for more nuclear power at present. That cannot be a very long-term point of view, or the lights will go out; the Minister knows that. That is a political stance that we all understand. The point is that to be able to proceed in future, we need the personnel. The Minister took the rather narrow view of the amendment that the Government must consider their immediate responsibility for funding training and research. I accept what he said about that and about the research councils.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-33_para30"></a>The Minister said that the main funding and initiative will always have to come from the industry. Of course it will, but how can the industry move ahead with training and educating people, collecting the research information and making plans unless it knows that more nuclear power generators will be needed? Industry does not proceed on the basis that an option is open. Again, I speak as an amateur, but that is only common sense. We must not be taken in by all this talk about the limited needs at present and forget the future. I am sorry that the Minister replied in that way; the Government are getting themselves into a difficult position. Should they win the next election, I wonder what they will do.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-34_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Perhaps I can add a few comments on the amendment. The Minister said clearly that he does not like the amendment as drafted. To an extent, having listened to the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, I understand that we can nitpick any amendment. The main thrust is that we ask the Government how they will keep the nuclear option open if the decline described by my noble friend Lady Carnegy continues. There is a current run-down of nuclear power. Off the top of my head, I think that by 2020 there may be only one nuclear plant left. How is industry to train people for the future if the industry has no future? Does not the Government's responsibility kick in before we lose the very skills that we need?
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para0"></a>The Minister also said that the Government were trying to keep the nuclear skills option open. How? We have heard this afternoon that he places responsibility on the industry; he highlighted the NDA's responsibility; but who will provide the money? If the nuclear industry is being wound down to the extent that it is, it will surely not invest in the future when it does not think that it has a future.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para1"></a>The Minister mentioned linking up with companies&#151;I think he mentioned one in France. That will mean that many of our current UK skills will become international skills and the situation described so clearly by my noble friend will become a thing of the past. Is not the Minister anxious about the Government's approach to this important issue? We have not called for new nuclear build&#151;my noble friend Lady Miller has not, and I have not so far&#151;but we cannot hide from the fact that the nuclear industry is being run down. How will we attract people in future?
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para2"></a>I cannot speak for my noble friend, but I am not entirely satisfied by the Minister's response. What money are the Government putting in? He talked about the skills programme and the group that meets on a regular basis&#151;quarterly, if I have it right. But what is it doing? What has come out of its meetings? Does it see a way forward?
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para3"></a>A series of questions follow from this important debate that the Minister has skated round. That may be because there is no government policy. If so, I should much rather he say that there is not, so that we all know where we are. I support my noble friend's amendment, although he may want to return on <P>


<a name="column_GC297"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC297</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Report with a different wording. The Government have not answered the questions that have been put to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   As the Minister is not replying to my noble friends, perhaps I can briefly sum up the debate. I do not for one moment regret that we will have spent nearly one hour on this vitally important subject. I cannot comment on all the points, except to say that perhaps if the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, had amended my amendment in the way he suggested, I probably would have been very happy to accept his amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para4"></a>In my opening remarks, I made reference to the fact that civil, mechanical and electrical engineers will have an enormously important part to play. That raises the whole argument about why young people now find no incentives for going into these very important professions. I can take some comfort from what the Minister said towards the end of his remarks&#151;namely, that the Government accept the need to ensure that the necessary skills for the industry are available. Of course, they would not be doing it all themselves. I entirely understand that. There will be other players such as the remains of the private sector.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para5"></a>I have two points regarding the Minister's comments. He said that a new programme to implement the nuclear option would require a significant additional expertise. The anxiety on this side of the Committee&#151;I speak for my noble friends&#151;is that when the Government decide, as they may, that this will be necessary, they may not have the people with that expertise. That is the anxiety. It is closing one's eyes to the dangers that lurk if one accepts the need to maintain an option without accepting that trained and experienced manpower is part of the reality.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para6"></a>Of course there will be a need for other people as well. But the point was made by many who spoke at Second Reading&#151;I remember a short but eloquent speech by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra&#151;that, as the Bill stands, it is not an energy Bill but a miscellaneous provisions Bill. Those of us who have sought to table amendments want to give it some reality as an energy Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para7"></a>As I said at Second Reading, this is the first major Bill from the Government since they published what they regard as a hugely important policy White Paper&#151;the energy White Paper. It is distressing that one is fobbed off with the answer that this, that or the other cannot be inserted into the Bill because it is not to do with decommissioning when the title of the Bill is the Energy Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para8"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lady Miller that Clause 7(1)(d) does not answer the problem that I have sought to identify. All it does is give the NDA a function to educate and train persons about such matters. It focuses only on the particular problem. With respect, that is not the answer.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para9"></a>The noble Lord said that we shall have nuclear energy for a long time, mentioning the year 2030. By then only one power station will be left: Sizewell B. All <P>


<a name="column_GC298"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC298</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the others will have gone; that is, all the Magnox stations and the AGRs. If we are going to keep the lights on and deal with our environmental objectives, it is inconceivable that we shall not have had to have a series of replacements by then. It is against that background that we are looking at these matters.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para10"></a>The noble Lord referred, as I did, to the sustainable energy policy network. I draw no inference from the fact that in the heading of the press release about it, while "Sustainable, Energy and Network" take capital letters, the word "policy" has a little "p". I took it off the Internet as it is. However, it goes extremely wide:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The work streams are: Climate Change, Reducing UK Emissions, Energy Efficiency, CHP"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-34_para11"></a>
It is good that that is now being considered&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Social including Fuel Poverty, International Energy Relations, Innovation, Education, Skills and Research, Transport, Security of Supply and Delivery Partnerships".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-34_para12"></a>
That is a huge agenda and I seriously question whether a body of this size with that kind of agenda is really going to be able to focus on the very serious problem which I sought to outline at the beginning of my remarks.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para13"></a>I have spoken for long enough. We shall certainly want to find a way to return to the matter and to put into this Energy Bill the fact that it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that it is dealt with. I claim no particular expertise over the drafting of the amendment. I shall study what the Minister said and return to it on Report. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para14"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para15"></a>Clause 74 agreed to.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding </B>   moved Amendment No. 106:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 75, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-34_para17"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"PART 2
<center><b>Environmental cost of electricity</B></center><br>
 ENVIRONMENTAL COST OF ELECTRICITY
<br>
 Within six months after the passing of this Act the Secretary of State shall complete and publish the results of his consideration of the European Commission's published report on the external costs of generating electricity by different technologies."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-34_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 106, I am reminded of that marvellous scene in Homer's Iliad where the Greeks are arguing over whether they should launch an expedition to Troy to take back the princess who had been captured by the Trojans. This great conclave took place at Pilos in south-west Greece. Homer records how the argument went this way and that over many hours until finally only one voice could be heard: that of old Thersites, who went on arguing. I suspect that, aside from the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, I may be the oldest Member of the Committee, and I hope that I shall not be tarred with the brush of old Thersites.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para19"></a>I can move this amendment rather more briefly. As Ministers will know, the European Union has conducted a 10-year study which shows that if the <P>


<a name="column_GC299"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC299</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>external costs of energy&#151;damage to the environment, damage to human health and a number of other factors&#151;were taken into account, the cost of electricity derived from coal or oil would double from its present level. The cost of electricity from gas, which is another fossil fuel, would increase by 30 per cent. Under our present system, those external costs are not met by the generators. They have to be covered by society at large and are not reflected in consumers' electricity bills.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para20"></a>The findings of the study are important and significant. Wind and hydro energy involve the lowest external costs, which is hardly surprising. In this country, I think we have pretty much exhausted our capacity for hydro energy, but I am prepared to be corrected. We are now embarking on more hazardous wind power generation. But what may be surprising to some Members of the Committee is that the report states that nuclear power also involves relatively low external costs&#151;much lower than those of coal, oil and gas and lower even than electricity from biomass.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para21"></a>I shall quote from the September 2003 edition of the Nuclear Issues news-sheet:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The results show that nuclear power involves relatively low external costs due to its low influence on global warming and its low probability of accidents in the EU power plants".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-34_para22"></a>
I ask noble Lords to remember those words because I shall come back to them:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Wind and hydro energy present the lowest external costs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-34_para23"></a>
The report goes on to give figures for the different member states of the Union:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the UK . . . (in ascending order) the external costs of electricity generation in EUR-cent per kWh as: wind 0.15, nuclear 0.25, biomass 1, Gas 1-2, oil 3-5, coal 4-7".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-34_para24"></a>
The figures cause one to ask questions. If those are the real costs of energy, taking into account environmental damage and harm to human health, why are the Government aiming to rely so heavily on imported gas? Why are they also aiming to increase the burning of biomass, when both are more damaging to health and the environment than nuclear energy?
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para25"></a>The European Commission has urged energy producers to pursue environmentally friendly options to help reduce these external costs. The EU guidelines on state aid for environmental protection published in February 2001 allow member states to grant operating aid to new plants producing renewable energy that will be calculated on the basis of external costs avoided up to 6 EUR-cents per kilowatt hour.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para26"></a>I have already referred to the Nuclear Issues news-sheet, which had this to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This raises the obvious point that such aid"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-34_para27"></a>
referring to aid for the burning of biomass, which is heavily subsidised by the present Government&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should similarly be available to support nuclear power generation&#151;a more environmentally friendly source of electricity than any other but wind&#151;rather than rely to an ever-increasing extent on gas-fired plant when the external costs for gas are 4-8 times greater than the nuclear option. It is also contrary to commonsense that the UK Government should be supporting the burning of biomass fuels to generate electricity under the Renewables Obligation and encouraging the planting of energy crops for this purpose when the Externe figures show that the <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_GC300"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC300</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>damage to the environment and human health from burning biomass (although less than for gas-firing) is up to four times greater than from a nuclear plant".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-34_para28"></a><P>

<a name="40203-34_para29"></a>That is a rather striking finding. Accordingly, I tabled a Question for Written Answer on 23 October. The response came from the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, when he was still answering Questions on Energy issues. He has since handed the brief to the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham. Among other things, he said this:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The department is considering the report and has not yet drawn any conclusions from it".&#151;[Official Report, 23/10,03; col. WA 192.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-34_para30"></a><P>

<a name="40203-34_para31"></a>The Answer goes on to refer to an analysis published with the energy White Paper. Unfortunately, however, the analysis does not address the central issue exposed in the EU report of the very different external costs of energy. The Defra paper dated October 2002 and entitled The Ancillary Effects of Green House Gas Mitigation&#151;that will relieve the noble Lord, Lord Whitty&#151;contains a very interesting table which is all about the ancillary effects of greenhouse gas mitigation for different mitigation policies and affected sectors. It may be tangentially relevant to the EU study, but it addresses the entirely separate problem of the sometimes different effects of reducing other even more toxic gases such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para32"></a>The interesting thing about table 1 in the report referred to in the Written Answer which I mentioned a moment ago is that, after considering "Energy Efficiency" and "Ancillary Effects", it considers "Reduction of demand for energy" and, below that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Fuel Switching . . . Moving from oil and coal to low or no emissions sources . . . petrol to diesel . . . to energy from waste",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-34_para33"></a>
and then "to nuclear".
Next to that, under "Ancillary Effects", it states that "Disposal of waste" is a "welfare loss", and also lists "Risk of accidents and proliferation". However, the EU study stated that nuclear energy came out near the bottom of the scale of external costs because it is in fact an extremely safe form of energy. The number of serious accidents and deaths at work in coal mines and the offshore oil and gas industry simply does not bear comparison with the number of accidents and deaths in the nuclear industry.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para34"></a>However, what do those comments in the paper say about Defra's attitude to nuclear energy? One of the reasons why it does not count in this study of the advantages of getting rid of CO <sub>2</sub> &#151;after all, that is the assumption written into the paper&#151;is in fact the risk of accidents and proliferation. That says it all.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para35"></a>I should say that, at that stage, Mr Michael Meacher was still the Minister in the department dealing with the matter. As I said, Defra is now a Meacher-free zone. I hope that perhaps the present generation of Ministers will be prepared to take a more realistic view on it.
<P>

<a name="40203-34_para36"></a>The Answer that I was given said that the Government are studying the EU report. My amendment calls on the Government to complete and publish the results of their study of the EU report <P>


<a name="column_GC301"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC301</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>within six months of the passing of the Bill into law. I think it is a very moderate amendment and I hope that the Government will be able to accept it. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   This is another amendment moved with much vigour and erudition by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, who always does very thorough reading before he puts forward any amendment. However, I have also had a look at this report, and there is a problem as far as I am concerned. The table to which he referred deals with existing technologies, but there are in fact also new technologies. Nuclear, after all, is an established technology. My old industry, coal, for example, has new technologies waiting for rather more government support than it is currently receiving to develop clean coal technology with carbon extraction. That is not mentioned in this table.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para0"></a>The impact of CHP and micro-CHP and all the other emerging technologies is more difficult to identify because this document deals with basic energies. None the less, I think we have to be a little cautious about the document as it stands because it deals with existing technologies. If it is to be examined with reference to the Bill, then due note should be taken of the potential of new technologies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, on the range of his contribution. He did not tell us whether Thersites ended up for or against the war. I remember the war having a rather satisfactory outcome for the Greeks. Presumably, the noble Lord was quoting him as one of the late conversions to the cause. As I recall, the war was not about weapons of mass destruction, but about the challenge to civilisation.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para1"></a>As regards the more general issues that he raised&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for giving way. I think that the wooden horse was a weapon of very mass destruction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Certainly, the wooden horse destroyed a city. I considered whether to describe it as a weapon of mass destruction before I made my remarks, but I shall not challenge the noble Lord on his erudition because I certainly would be outclassed. However, I appreciate the skill with which he deployed yet another facet of the nuclear industry case. Of course, he is right in certain parts of his analysis of and reflection on the report. I shall not contend that position at all; that would be exceedingly foolish of me.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para2"></a>In this amendment, the noble Lord provides an extremely useful peg on which to deploy a particular case. The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, suggested that it might have wider, fuller and further-reaching perspectives on the development of new technologies than it seemed in the way in which it was defined. Of course, what is being asked for is that this be an amendment to the Bill, which would require the Secretary of State to publish within six months of the passing of the Act an assessment of the European Commission's report.
<P>


<a name="column_GC302"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para3"></a>Perhaps I may emphasise to the Committee that this is an important report, but it is not unique. It is part of a series of reports starting in the early 1990s looking at the external costs of various forms of energy. It is an extremely useful and significant document; the noble Lord identified some very salient points in it. But we all recognise that the report is not definitive. It is a contribution to an area where we all know that a huge amount of continuing work is necessary, not least in relation to new developments and new technology, as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. Ongoing work is required. There are many gaps in our knowledge and many uncertainties remain about those very difficult issues regarding energy generation.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para4"></a>The obvious point is that there is no need to require in legislation that this report should be considered. Indeed, it would be a very strange use of an Act of Parliament to have enshrined in it a commitment to a particular report that must have a published response within a limited period of time. After all, this clause presumably would fail. After that obligation had been met within a few months, this amendment to the clause would have no relevance to the longer-term future because it would refer to a report that had already been considered and dealt with.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para5"></a>The noble Lord indicated that he had tabled a Question on this matter to my noble friend Lord Sainsbury, who gave him an open, clear and frank Answer, as is his wont. He indicated that we regarded the report as a significant contribution to knowledge, but that we do not believe we need to publish a formal assessment of its conclusions. We neither endorse nor reject its findings. We take that as part of the important contribution to a difficult area of debate.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para6"></a>Of course, we all appreciate the extent to which the noble Lord has drawn interesting and salient points from the report. But surely it would not be right for us to enshrine in legislation&#151;which is what his amendment proposes&#151;a requirement on the part of the Government to publish a report, which would have to be done within a matter of months. Subsequently, everyone would wonder what on earth this was doing in an Act of Parliament that we all recognise has got considerable significance for the future of our energy industry for many years to come. On that basis, perhaps the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I cannot say that I was surprised by the noble Lord's reply. I am sure he will recognise, because he has been in opposition in his time, that amendments to Bills are one of the ways in which Parliament can raise matters of concern which may be more or less tangential to the main thrust of the Bill. That has always been done. I have no doubt that when the Government are in opposition again, the noble Lord and his noble friends will do exactly the same. It is a well known tactic.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para7"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord was not able to be a little more forthcoming. He recognises that if I had asked a Written Question on this, there is no way that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>I would have put in a supplementary question anything like the amount of information that I was able to convey in my brief opening speech on the amendment. However, I shall seek other avenues with which to pursue the matter.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para8"></a>I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, that this is a moving target. There are constantly improving technologies in the nuclear field as well as everywhere else which need to be kept constantly under review. We need to find a way in which, if the Government really are studying these matters, we can oblige them to take the public into their confidence as to the conclusions they are coming to in regard to these matters. That may be done through an interim report&#151;as I said, matters are constantly moving&#151;but it should not lurk within departments.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para9"></a>The EU has published its very important 10-year study, to which the Government should respond and indicate the applicability of its findings to the UK situation. I shall consider how best we can pursue that issue. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para10"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-35_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 106ZZA:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> Insert the following new Clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-35_para11"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF OFF-SHORE GENERATION
<br>
(1) The Secretary of State shall, within two years of the passing of this Act, present to both Houses of Parliament a report on off-shore renewable technologies that&#151;
<br>
(a) identifies the areas most suitable for offshore generation of electricity, and
<br>
(b) includes an assessment of the environmental benefits and risks of developing generation in these areas.
<br>
(2) The report mentioned in subsection (1) shall include, but not be limited to, assessments for generation by means of wind power, wave power and tidal power."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-35_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: It will be a considerable relief&#151;at least to me and one or two other members of the Committee&#151;to move on to what I consider to be the second, forward looking, part of the Bill. Modern technologies can offer a great deal for the future. Constantly looking backwards to what nuclear power appeared to offer in the middle of the 20th century perhaps is not the best way to move forward.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para13"></a>Part 2 deals with the development of potential for offshore generation. The amendment seeks that the Government should develop within two years of the passing of the Act a strategic environmental assessment of offshore generation. In effect, that means a green tape measure with which we can calculate, through a process of appraisal, the kind of environmental protection and sustainable development factors that need to be taken into account when decisions are taken, either nationally or locally, in regard to the development of offshore technology.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para14"></a>The amendment is particularly needed because, at the moment, we have no marine spatial planning framework. I know that in the paper Safeguarding Our Seas the Government expressed an interest in developing legislation to cover marine areas, but that <P>


<a name="column_GC304"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has not been forthcoming. It will not be introduced in this Session of Parliament and possibly not the next. So the marine environment is not covered by any kind of planning framework. There is nothing against which to judge what is proposed for development in marine areas.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para15"></a>That should worry us. When generating plants have been developed on land there has been a planning framework against which to judge them and which takes all kinds of issues into account. We do not have that kind of planning framework for our marine areas. Therefore a strategic environmental assessment is of particular importance.
<P>

<a name="40203-35_para16"></a>Our Government signed-up to these assessments when a European Parliament directive was issued in 2001. The stated aim of the directive that enabled the strategic environmental assessment is to provide a high level of protection of the environment and to contribute to the integration of environmental considerations into the preparation and adoption of plans and programmes with a view to promoting sustainable development. They are different from environmental impact assessments, which are used when considering one focused project. Strategic environmental assessments are intended to cover a much wider area. They would be particularly suitable for inclusion in the Bill because we are looking at the whole marine environment for many purposes, some of which are as yet undefined. We do not know what wind, wave and tidal power will mean for technology, even over the lifetime of the Bill. Technologies are developing fast. Against that background we need some way of measuring the likely impact on the environment. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40203-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   In supporting the amendment, I wish to take a leaf out of the book of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and say that this seems to be another occasion on which a wider issue can be raised. As the noble Lord mentioned at Second Reading, some of us felt that the scope of the Bill was too narrow. Therefore, we must take advantage of the relevant parts of the Bill to introduce issues of more general policy. My noble friend has raised an environmental issue of great importance. The Bill could gain substantially from having an introduction of the kind that she has proposed for Part 2 of the Bill on renewable energy sources.

Some environmental problems that have been experienced and sometimes answered in respect of oil rigs may be relevant. Have the Government any information on that?

<FONT SIZE=3>months the wind hardly blew at all, we all realised that, excellent though the idea of wind power is, there would not have been much for three months and there would have been a need for back-up additional to any other generation. In assessing the environmental impact, is it possible to take account of back-up?
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para1"></a>I am making a point rather than asking a question that is easy to answer. I hope that the Minister, who is so very knowledgeable on these points, may be able to help me.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-36_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Elton): </B>  The business before the Committee is Amendment No. 106ZZA.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I wish to return to a theme that I was advancing on the Floor of the House in my Question this afternoon. The problem of low-frequency sound is a very recent discovery, and I have certainly not been able to find anyone who has done any research into its impact in the marine environment. It is necessary to bear in mind that water is an extremely efficient transmitter for sound.
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para3"></a>The means by which a wind generator is installed in the seabed is very simple and basic; that is one reason why it is such an attractive economic proposition. A very large ship is sent out with a very large pile driver. The coverage on my local television station in Essex was full of such a scene only a few weeks ago, showing an offshore plant just off Yarmouth. A very large steel pipe is driven into the seabed until it can be driven no further. The pipe must be of the appropriate length so that the top is above the water. It has a mounting plate on it, and the pylon, generator and vanes are mounted on that, and that is it. The whole structure is such that it is a remarkably efficient transmitter of sound. It will not transmit only the high-level sound that will come from the generator, but the low-frequency sound generated by the vanes. It will put those low-frequency waves into the water.
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para4"></a>I have been able to see nothing that suggests that research has been done into the possible impact. We know from other walks of life that the likes of submarines have had bad reports, because of the low-frequency sound effects that upset whales' navigation. There is a potential problem. All right; we may not have many whales floating around in British waters, and the issue may not be considered very great. However, any whale hugger would certainly consider it very important. The same applies to porpoises. The point is that we do not know the impact on other fish species.
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para5"></a>My purpose in asking a Question earlier today was not to prevent the installation of wind farms, but to make sure that research was done before we got any further down the road so that, if larger buffer zones are required round them on land, we have them before we have wind farms right up to the edges of every town and village in the country. In that way, we can affect what is happening. The research needs to be done <P>


<a name="column_GC306"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC306</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>quickly. The same argument applies in the marine environment. We do not know what the effects of wind farms will be on the marine environment, and until we know we would be wise to be a little cautious.
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para6"></a>I put the matter no higher than that, but I support the amendment for that very reason. I hope that the Minister will not say in response, "This is going to be another one of those reports. The clause will be dead once the report is presented, so there is no point putting it in the Bill". Although the argument is valid, there is some purpose here and the amendment deserves a better answer than that, as did the previous one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-36_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   I welcome the amendment. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, that we need to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the Bill. That follows the arguments of my noble friend Lord Jenkin. Unfortunately, my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith has taken the wind right out of my sails and covered one of the points that I was going to make. Of course, he did it much better than I could ever hope to do.
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para7"></a>The amendment would benefit from providing that the report also covered economic considerations. As an example, during a debate on a recent Unstarred Question, the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, talked about the economics claimed for tidal lagoons. I hope that the report would cover such issues.
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para8"></a>When considering offshore energy, it is important that the Government set the course and ensure that we remain on it. The report would be helpful in that regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-36_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I also support the amendment. If the Minister cannot accept it word for word, I hope that the principle behind it will be accepted. I do not know whether the Government have paid any regard as yet to the EFRA meeting of 12 November, as it is very important that they should. At that stage, that committee was interviewing people with regard to marine conservation. The wildlife trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, the Marine Conservation Society, WWF-UK and Wildlife and Countryside Link were among the groups represented that day, to name a few.
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para9"></a>I took the 35-page brief and sat just outside Sizewell and read it last weekend. What comes through very clearly is that the groups feel that there is no vision for marine environment development. They were asked direct questions on what they thought about matters and what might be done. At one stage, they questioned whether there ought to be a particular Minister responsible, as wind farms come under the auspices of the DTI, the ODPM and Defra. I may be wrong and have missed a department out, but I think that those are the three relevant departments. It has been suggested that each department has a green Minister. That is wonderful, but what have the green Ministers <P>


<a name="column_GC307"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC307</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>done? There is the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, but I would expect him to be a green Minister in his department.
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para10"></a>What has happened since that meeting? I understand that the ODPM is the department that gives planning permission for offshore wind farms. There seemed to be great gaps in provision for looking forward, and there was no framework for accountability, reflection or any of the matters raised in the amendment by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer.
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para11"></a>There are simple matters involved. For example, what happens if a wind turbine has an effect on sea ducks or other birds? Is there a risk? Has a risk assessment been done? If so, where is it? That is not in the Bill; if we are talking about developing offshore wind turbine farms, I would have thought that it should be. Visually, it is said that wind farms should not be erected in sensitive areas. What sort of risk assessment has been done? What thought has come forward on that?
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para12"></a>On 7 January, the committee met again. This time it interviewed Elliot Morley, who referred to John Randall's Private Member's Bill, which raised the whole question of protection and enforcement. My second question concerns enforcement; I have tabled some amendments to cover that later. It is no use having wonderful ideas if nothing is written into the Bill to protect the very things that we are trying to protect.
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para13"></a>In answering another question, the Minister said that Defra has put 10 million into research. What research has been completed, and are the responses to that research in the public domain? I gather from other departments and sources that another 30 million may be made available. What resources are there, where is it going, what is the time-scale, and what "commercial interests"&#151;referred to in the Defra committee meeting&#151;are being protected? How much can be put into the public domain?
<P>

<a name="40203-36_para14"></a>I would have raised these issues later when speaking to my amendments but I am glad to be able to do so now. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, has raised a very important issue. Reading through the minutes of both committee meetings, I was struck by the fact that there are huge gaps. Some departments are doing bits of the necessary work but no one seems to be pulling it together. It has been suggested that a marine Act may be needed. The evidence seems to indicate that that was felt to be unnecessary because powers are available in existing legislation. However, who will pull it all together? Who is the number one person in charge? I was not able to find those answers in the report. I therefore hope that the Minister will touch on the broader issue. It is germane to the amendment before us, which I have great pleasure in supporting.

<A NAME="40203-37_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   I, too, support Amendment No. 106ZZA. This chapter of the Bill deals with the rights of the United Kingdom to establish an exclusive economic zone within which it has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting the zone for <P>


<a name="column_GC308"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC308</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the production of energy from the water, currents and winds. However, there is great concern among many about the extent of the effect that the Government's target for wind power will have on different regions of the UK and, for that matter, in our coastal waters even further out to sea.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para0"></a>The new PPS22 suggests:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Offshore renewable generation projects . . . should be identified as a separate regional target from land-based renewable energy projects",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-37_para1"></a>
and that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the potential to generate substantial amounts of renewable energy from offshore projects should not be used to set lower targets for onshore projects".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-37_para2"></a>
In view of that, should not the Government set targets for individual renewable energy zones and incorporate a report of that nature into the assessment of offshore generation proposed by Amendment No. 106ZZA, perhaps under subsection (2)? This amendment and the publication of targets for each renewable energy zone would go a long way towards allaying fears or concentrating the mind more clearly on what is proposed for each zone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-37_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I shall detain the Committee for only a few moments. It has become quite clear from the words of three of my noble friends who speak from our Front Bench on three different subjects that we support the amendment. As I said at the beginning, although this is a DTI Bill, the Minister is from Defra. We have covered many issues today, especially those raised by my noble friend Lady Byford, who covers Defra issues and is working with me on this Bill. It is most interesting that my noble friends have all the required skills to explain why the amendment is necessary. I think the Minister will understand that we feel this provision is very important.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para3"></a>I say that in the light of today's topical Unstarred Question&#151;which, when mentioned by my noble friend, quite took the wind out of my other noble friend. It is interesting that the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, when dealing with comments about an article on the dangers, indicated that other articles suggest differently. I think that the issue needs to be examined. It is most important and should be in the public domain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I hope to convince the Committee that I am giving a positive response to the theme of the amendment and the contributions in support of it in the hope that, having heard me, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw it on the basis of my assurances.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para4"></a>I am sorry that the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, had the wind taken out of his sails, but that was the burden of the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy: what happens when the wind is taken out of sails. I reassure her that we will take into account what she referred to as the necessary support and back-up for energy generated by wind turbines. We recognise that over the course of a year, generation from wind turbines will not follow an even production platform <P>


<a name="column_GC309"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC309</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because of wind variations. We must therefore take into account what will provide a supplement and back-up as part of our general evaluation.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para5"></a>The main burden of my response&#151;although I shall try to deal also with some of the detailed points raised&#151;is to say that we strongly sympathise with the thought behind the amendment. I assure the Committee that we are already doing what it seeks and intend to meet most of the requirements mentioned in representations&#151;certainly in terms of the general propositions about what the Government need to do to evaluate those effects. At the same time, I shall do my best to deal with the detailed points and will take steps to add in writing anything that I leave out.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para6"></a>We have already commissioned a study to identify the geographic distribution of the UK's offshore renewable energy resource that will achieve the requirement in proposed new paragraph (a). That study, called Atlas, is due to be completed in summer 2004 and will certainly be made available to Parliament, as requested.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para7"></a>Proposed new paragraph (b) requires,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an assessment of the environmental benefits and risks of developing generation",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-37_para8"></a>
in potentially suitable areas. The noble Baroness will appreciate that to perform that thoroughly will take longer than the two years stipulated in the amendment. It will be a major programme of work requiring the collection and analysis of a great deal of field data. We are undertaking that work, but on a phased basis. Separate environmental reports will be produced that can certainly be made available to both Houses, but it is unrealistic to imagine that that work can be completed within the two years specified in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para9"></a>The final proposed requirement is that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The report . . . shall include, but not be limited to",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-37_para10"></a>
generation from wind, wave and tidal power. The renewable energy sources that can be exploited within renewable energy zones include wind and water. A study of the potential available offshore renewable energy sources will therefore extend to all technologies. We are going as wide as we possibly can; I assure the noble Baroness of that.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para11"></a>On the question of the Government's general obligations, we must meet the requirements of the European directive, so we are under obligations to produce some of that work. That partly conditions the extent to which that work is in progress. We will adopt the same strategic approach to arrangements for future site leasing competitions for wind farms.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para12"></a>I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, says about what might be the impact on marine life. The wind farms we are considering are not expected to be in deep waters: the limit is about 30 metres. I do not suggest that that does not raise some of the issues he mentioned for marine life; but it is unlikely to affect some of the categories he identified as problems.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para13"></a>I want to comment on one or two other specific points that have been raised. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, asked about enforcement. I hope that <P>


<a name="column_GC310"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC310</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>she will forgive me if I do not go into detail at this point because that is a matter for later in the Bill. However, I recognise that her representation was made to strengthen the general view of the Committee that some reassurance is needed that this work is going on. I can give that reassurance.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para14"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked about tidal lagoons. I do not have any specific briefing on that point, but I shall take it on board, as I will the matter introduced into our discussion by the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater. Those were specific points addressing the need effectively to cover all the issues in this area.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para15"></a>I say to the Committee that we recognise the force of the amendment. It has given us an opportunity to make what I hope the Committee will regard as a positive response, but I am sure that noble Lords will recognise that the amendment has some defects, not least the timescale within which we would have to produce this work. The schedule is too tight for the immense programme that we shall need.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para16"></a>However, if we have overlooked any details, they have certainly been drawn to our attention today, which may serve to increase the workload rather than reduce it. I give way to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   The Minister will be pleased to hear that I am somewhat encouraged by what he said. However, the problem we must face is that the installation of some of these establishments is already taking place&#151;before the assessment work has been done. It is that which concerns us.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para17"></a>Although the eternal optimist in me says that the chance of anything going wrong is pretty minor, the reality is that if we have wind farms dotted around our coasts before we have the results of this research and there are adverse consequences, we shall have caused long-standing damage that our children and our children's children will regret long after we are gone. That is not a responsible way to behave. We must impress on the Government the urgency of getting this work done. With due deference, I do not think that the Minister has answered that point.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   We are proceeding with some caution on wind farms at sea and undertaking a complete assessment of the work. I am not suggesting that it will be years before an assessment is available, but many points have been made in the Committee across the whole field of the issues. A substantial amount of work has to be done and it is unrealistic to expect to produce a comprehensive report within two years.
<P>

<a name="40203-37_para18"></a>Having mentioned the requirements of the European directive, I also want to reassure the noble Lord that, far from wind farms being developed at sea with gay abandon and without the slightest regard to the consequences, careful evaluation is being undertaken. However, until some of the turbines are installed, we shall not be able to carry out a full evaluation. It is a classic chicken-and-egg situation.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am not here to advise the noble Baroness on how to draft amendments. Rather I have identified what is probably the most salient point of the amendment and which means that we think it should be withdrawn. If such a provision were in the Bill, it would present the Government with an impossible target. However, we are not saying that we do not agree with the broad thrust here. We are trying to meet those obligations and we have a full programme of work in place to meet the objectives. However, the element of timing is what is most difficult for us to accept.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, responds, I hope that the Minister will clarify some points that he has skated around. In his opening comments, he said, "We are already doing it". What are they already doing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   We have in place a programme to evaluate the impact of the development of wind farms at sea. I emphasise the crucial point that we are not involved in the reckless spread of wind farms without carrying out a concomitant programme of evaluation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for clarifying that. Furthermore, how many evaluations have been done; to whom do they report; is it in the public domain; and what is the effect on wildlife, which I mentioned earlier, and the environmental concerns expressed by groups outside this Chamber? I think that I am right in quoting the Minister as having said that, on the whole, wind farms would not be built in waters more than 13 metres deep.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   Thirty metres.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I realise that that limits the zone to much closer inshore than offshore. Is research being done on the "nearest inshore-offshore", if the Committee understands what I mean, rather than the wider limit? The zone possibly extends to 12 miles and then up to the 200-mile limit. Obviously, there is a huge range of options within that. I would be grateful if the Minister would address the point that three departments are supposedly doing different bits at different times. Who has the lead role; who is pulling it together; and what is happening? None of those questions has been answered. I would be grateful for an answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   More than one department has an interest in the work, but the DTI has the lead <P>


<a name="column_GC312"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC312</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>role. It takes responsibility for answering questions on the matter and co-ordinating the work. On the range of the assessment of wind farms at sea, we are doing that as they are commissioned, licences obtained and the wind farms built. The noble Baroness will recognise that we are in relatively early days on that matter.
<P>

<a name="40203-38_para0"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about an area on which we are not in early days: what we are doing at present. We are not in early days on the oil and gas position, which the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, raised. We carry out a full environmental assessment of the impact of those developments. They help to inform other work at sea.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, but he speaks as if we are the first country to build wind farms. There are immense wind farms all over the Netherlands and elsewhere. Surely those countries have made assessments. Are they not being taken into account?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   They are, but I thought that the thrust of the amendment and the tenor of the approach taken by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, was to ask what the Government are doing. I was trying to phrase my response&#151;a narrow one, I admit&#151;to our current activity. The noble Lord is absolutely right; other countries are more advanced in certain areas of this technology. Of course we seek to benefit as best we can from the lessons that they have learned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   The Minister has helped the Grand Committee by saying that a map of coastal waters which are most suitable for wind farms is currently being produced and that they will be let out or disposed of in the same way as oil in its early days. Will that assessment take into account both the capacity of each individual area&#151;that is, the amount of generation expected from it&#151;and the hook-up to the grid, including the cost of the hook-up, the availability of the grid and whether or not other assessments are needed before it is brought into the National Grid?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I can reassure the noble Viscount on that point. He will recognise that the ecology of different sites at sea varies enormously, as do the economic challenges of making them effective enough to link up to the National Grid. I can assure the noble Viscount that when the map is designed it will take such factors into account, although he will also recognise that it is not a straightforward task.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   If, before Report stage, the Minister could point me in the direction of the information that I asked for earlier, I should be very grateful.
<P>

<a name="40203-38_para1"></a>In the discussions on the Defra report it was felt that there was no accountability and that organisations would be pushed from one department to another. I should like this important issue addressed. We are not saying that there should not be any wind farms&#151;the <P>


<a name="column_GC313"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Minister should not run away with that idea&#151;but we are concerned that they may be built in areas where they will disrupt our most sensitive marine life.
<P>

<a name="40203-38_para2"></a>We have the opportunity today to debate this enormously important issue. I seek extra guidance, but if the Minister cannot give it today I should be grateful if he would write to me. We shall, no doubt, be lobbied by outside groups. They will say, "You referred to the comments that we made when giving evidence to the Select Committee, but where do we go from here?".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am happy to give the assurance that the information requested will be given. We can see from the discussions in Committee that information has been requested. Where it has not been given, we shall obviously take steps to provide it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew13"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   The Committee will forgive me if I have not quite kept up with the arguments, but surely anyone building offshore power stations will be asked to carry out an environmental impact study. If this covers areas which are under investigation or research at this point, what will be the Government's attitude to the application for construction? Will everything be put on hold until after the Government have finished their inquiries? What kind of environmental impact studies will they ask for?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-38_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The answer to that question is that the people who are taking-up such a licence will be well aware of the obligations placed upon them in terms of the criteria they have to meet. The Government of course are concerned with the overall position across the whole of the nation&#151;certainly in regard to the economic benefits. That ties in with the crucial point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, in regard to the link up with the National Grid.

The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked whether we should include economic issues in the amendment. They are worth considering but they should not be included in the amendment. The previous amendment perhaps touched more on them. So, although they are critically important issues&#151;as the noble Earl said, the debate on tidal power in your Lordships' House a few weeks ago underlined how much we need to consider the economic issues&#151;I should like to concentrate on the remarks made by noble Lords in regard to the amendment and its environmental aspect.
<P>

<a name="40203-38_para3"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, is correct to say that we have a vision for marine development. That is exactly how I regard the amendment. When the Minister came to reply, the message I got from him was perhaps delivered in a gentler and nicer way than normal&#151;the word "environment" seems to produce that in people&#151;but he still said, "No, the Government are not interested in accepting the amendment". That seems to be for two reasons. First, the Government think that they are doing it already, and secondly, it <P>


<a name="column_GC314"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC314</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would make life too difficult. I do not think either reason really worthy of overriding so critical an issue. Although I accept that the Government are doing a lot of work already, it is not joined up. They themselves recognise that by their very promise to bring forward a marine Act. They know that the situation is unsatisfactory.
<P>

<a name="40203-38_para4"></a>If I thought that the Government believed that the situation was satisfactory, I would probably not feel so strongly about the amendment. However, by their own admission they say time and again&#151;it is documented, with Mrs Beckett's quotations in Safeguarding Our Seas&#151;that a marine Act is important. That leads me to think that, in the absence of that Act, the amendment to the Bill is essential.
<P>

<a name="40203-38_para5"></a>The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, raised an interesting point about whether individual licence holders would, for example, have to conduct environmental impact studies. They probably should have to, but they should be able to do it within the framework of an overall national framework. That is what is lacking. It is not really very fair to expect individual licence holders to conduct their application without a national framework developed by the Government. How would individual people approach planning permissions on land if they had to do so in a complete vacuum? The situation is very similar, except that it happens to be at sea.
<P>

<a name="40203-38_para6"></a>Therefore, I cannot see that the Government's position is in any way logical. I underline the fact that I certainly do not want the amendment to be a brake on offshore renewable energy development. I see the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, looking slightly doubtful about that, but he can be assured that my commitment and that of the Liberal Democrats to developing renewable technology is very deep. At the same time, it has to be against a background of knowing what we are doing and what we are putting in place. If we are developing offshore technologies as we should as a matter of urgency, it is a matter of urgency that we put the framework in place.
<P>

<a name="40203-38_para7"></a>I will certainly return to the issue on Report. I hope to have discussions with the Minister before then about the length of time that the Government think might be reasonable. If they think that two years is unreasonable, I might accept that. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40203-39_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 106ZA:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 58, line 16, after "from" insert "renewable sources such as, but not limited to,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-39_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40203-39_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is small and probing. It aims to explore whether the Bill is limited to the renewable sources that it cites, which are wind and water power. It is hard to envisage that there could be much else of importance in a marine environment, but what if, for example, there were some form of floating solar capture in future? Would the Bill be unable to cover that? Both the amendment <P>


<a name="column_GC315"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC315</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and Amendment No. 109G, which is to do with definitions, are to explore the issue. Floating solar capture is my best example. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Let me add one comment to muddy the waters, although only very slightly. It is useful to do so because wind and water are fine, but one could envisage sources of heat below the sea bed that could well be picked up by heat transfer and made use of. Technically, under the Bill, that procedure is excluded. I am sure that that is not the Government's intention so, although I would not necessarily expect them to say instinctively that the amendment was great, they might be prepared to take it away and look at the question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   We are not. The reason is that we are constrained by international law in what we can do beyond 12 nautical miles. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), referred to in Clause 75, gives us the right to produce energy from the water and winds in what we are calling renewable energy zones. To include other renewable sources, such as that mentioned by the noble Lord, within the scope of Clause 75 would be to breach the convention, so we cannot accept the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-39_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   The Government produced useful Explanatory Notes to accompany the Bill. I refer the Minister to paragraph 214, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"UNCLOS also gives coastal States the exclusive right to construct and authorize and regulate the construction, operation and use of artificial islands, installations and structures for the purposes outlined above and other economic purposes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-39_para2"></a>
The Minister appeared to rule that out. Can he clear up that matter for the Committee?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I was citing the basis on which we drafted Clause 75 against the requirements of the UN convention. I cannot comment in detail about other areas in which different activity may be possible. As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said, if heat is under the sea bed, it may be captured under the Continental Shelf Act 1964 and be a resource of the soil, not a resource of the sea, and fall under a different framework. But as I understand it, the position advanced by the noble Baroness had more to do with solar issues, and so on, and I merely suggested that our concept of the renewable energy zone is restricted within the law of the sea to the product of wind and water.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-39_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Reading the Bill, the clause applies only to areas of the sea outside the territorial sea. Therefore, for the first time today, I agree with the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-39_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the Minister for his explanation and those who contributed to this short but interesting debate. In the light of his explanation, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-39_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford </B>   moved Amendment No. 106A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 58, line 16, at end insert "in a manner which maintains the natural environment"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-39_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40203-39_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 106B and 106G, which are grouped. Turning to Amendment No. 106A, there are national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and special landscape areas. There are sites of special scientific interest; there is common land and open access land; there are bridleways and footpaths. All of those have legislation attached to them, some of which protects them from those who would damage and exploit them. There is little comparable in the marine environment, yet a steady flow of discovery implies that the sea bed is a wonderful place. More importantly, it appears also to be a vulnerable place. We need think only of the black coral reef off Scotland to realise that there is much about which we do not know, some of which may turn out to be exceedingly valuable.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para6"></a>The use of the word "exploitation" worried me, because it carries connotations of ruthlessness. Undoubtedly that is not what is intended, but it may well be how people interpret it. Indeed, the subsidiary definition of the word in Chambers is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the act of using for selfish purposes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-39_para7"></a>
I ask the Minister why that particular phraseology has been used and I hope that, having listened to my explanation of my suggested wording, he will be willing to take it on board.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para8"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 106B. We are told that certain types of fishing cause damage to the sea bed and that some areas are now beyond repair. Only recently we had another Select Committee report looking at the Common Fisheries Policy. We have been fishing since Moses was a boy and yet still have not managed to perfect methods that conserve the marine environment. How much more damage is likely to be caused by those charged with examining the deep sea to determine how it may be used to provide energy.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para9"></a>We should bear in mind that many of those undertaking this work may not be seafarers. They will be people who have done the same kind of work on dry land and who inevitably will try first to apply the lessons learnt there. Can the Minister tell us about the department's thinking on how this subsection was developed? Were there any feelings about how such exploitation would be controlled, whether by order or through guidance? Perhaps government bodies such as the Environment Agency are to be used, or will they rely on organisations like Greenpeace? It is important to note that the use of wind turbines is not considered by everyone to be always a good thing. Grave concerns have been expressed that the installation of these structures will, in some cases, outweigh the energy consumption and carbon production their use might save.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para10"></a>In that connection the latest issue of the AONB Association newsletter contains an article by Richard Bull suggesting that wind power is a viable proposition only in the short to medium term. If he is right, it is <P>


<a name="column_GC317"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC317</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>imperative that the exploration of possible sites does not add to the negative side of the equation. This, I think, is an important point.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para11"></a>I have tabled Amendment No. 106G to give Members of the Committee the opportunity to debate an issue which is of major relevance to any extension of wind farms on the scale seemingly being proposed by the Government. It is a paradox that the renewable energy said to be needed in order to prevent atmospheric pollution can be delivered only at the cost of visual pollution on a truly massive scale. So we have to ask ourselves how to resolve this problem, especially if we are not to consider using clean nuclear power energy supplies, which we discussed earlier. How are we to save from destruction some of the great desolate places and grand sea vistas of our country by the advance of armies of whirling propellers that have caused much dismay in some of our most beautiful and rugged mountain countryside?
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para12"></a>No one these days thinks it respectable to cause pollution at sea by depositing rubbish in our waters. Thank goodness that we have moved on from those times. Will it be too late before we realise the damage we may cause by spreading visual pollution to our coastal waters? The Government have a duty to spell out in advance the extent of the installations that they intend to create offshore and what criteria governing their impact on our natural environment they will include in any planning decisions. Surely our people must have a say in this through the planning system.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para13"></a>One thinks of the low, flat East Anglian coast, from which I have just returned, or the wild salt marshes and the sweep of the Wash, flanked by noble churches. Here I declare an interest in and love for both counties. Those great low skies so beloved by generations of painters, walkers and photographers will never be the same again if wind farms march towards the shores like Martians out of the War of the Worlds. What of our great coasts and natural parks; the North Yorkshire moors; the Cornish coastal paths. Those desolate places will never look the same again.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para14"></a>What protection, if any, do the Government propose for these views, which are part of our national heritage? Where is the special protection for national parks? Perhaps there is some, but I have not come across it. Will any consideration be given to areas of outstanding natural beauty or to our coastal paths? Without the complement of the open sea in all its moods, none of these places will be exactly the same.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para15"></a>This is a probing amendment but it relates to a serious issue. Perhaps I may advance a few ideas which I hope the Minister will carefully consider. Surely our environmental bodies must have a voice enshrined in the planning system before the Government can make zoning orders. Is it too much to ask that the powers in last year's Local Government Act, which allow local polls, might be used to allow the populations affected to express views and, where relevant, to come forward with a veto?

<a name="40203-39_para16"></a>I hope the Government will enter the debate in all seriousness. It will be nothing short of a tragedy if we were to lose some of our finest coastal vistas through a lack of proper planning and protection for them.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para17"></a>I referred to planning during the debate on an earlier amendment. Although it is the responsibility of the ODPM, all departments need to consider this issue. The debates in the Select Committee revealed that there is a great worry about the future of marine development. That is why I have brought forward these amendments. I beg to move.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-39_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I support the spirit of the first two amendments. I would feel more comfortable if the wording of the first one stated "in a manner which respects the natural environment". I am worried that the maintenance of a natural feature&#151;for example, a tidal lagoon&#151;in its exact state would not be possible.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para18"></a>As regards Amendment No. 106B, again, the concept of irreversible damage is very important. But we would need to consider what the timescale of "irreversible" should be. I have not had an answer to that so I merely raise the query with the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para19"></a>The issue of renewable energy zones off national parks is very important. I know best Exmoor National Park, the coastal part of which is, for me and a number of visitors, the most exciting. However, I would hesitate to give local people the veto over what should happen. This is because national parks are national assets and what takes place in them or just offshore of them affects us all.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para20"></a>There is a further difficulty. As with the building of nuclear power stations and onshore wind turbines, a planning process has to be gone through. As soon as a project is proposed, it is very easy for people to rally a great deal of opposition. If too much of a veto mentality is brought in, we would never be able to develop anything anywhere, even if it was in our interest. I would urge caution about that.
<P>

<a name="40203-39_para21"></a>That brings me to the point that there is a planning process to deal with these issues on land, but none to deal with them in a marine environment.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-40_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I ought to know this, but can the Minister tell me whether local planning committees have any say about the seascape between the coast and the horizon, as it were; that is, what one can see from the land. I am not sure whether they do and it would be interesting to know.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-40_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   As I listened to my noble friend talk about Amendment No. 106G, I envisaged that we could all be walking around those national parks. I wondered why so many of us were sitting here, just listening to how we could protect them. She spoke with a great deal of emotion and obviously feels strongly about the issue, as we all do. Everyone is concerned about the countryside.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para0"></a>Earlier we discussed new technologies. In a sense, given the scale on which we envisage this technology, it is new. Therefore, it is important that we consider all the exploitation&#151;I did not mean to use that word; I meant to say, "advantages and disadvantages"&#151;that it could bring to the countryside. I used the word "exploitation" in error, as that one word caught my eye in Amendment No. 106A.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para1"></a>[The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 6.6 to 6.15 p.m.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-40_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I am not 100 per cent sure where I was when, all of a sudden, the Bell went. So I will simply say that the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in a manner which maintains the natural environment",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-40_para2"></a>
are gentle words that balance the word "exploitation", which my noble friend mentioned. She gave an interpretation of what "exploitation" could mean. It is interesting that my dictionary&#151;I, too, looked it up because it is a harsh word&#151;defines it as:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to use or develop for one's own ends or to take advantage of".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-40_para3"></a>
That interpretation is not as nice, but if we add the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in a manner which maintains the natural environment",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-40_para4"></a>
that would counterbalance the wording. I cannot imagine that those eight words would make such an enormous difference to the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-40_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   Like every other Member of the Committee, I was impressed and moved by the defence of our wonderful countryside and coastline mounted by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. I share her passion for walking on coastal paths and elsewhere in the countryside. As a consequence, I have no hesitation in agreeing with what I take to be the motivation behind this group of amendments tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Byford and Lady Miller of Hendon, which is to ensure that renewable energy zones are developed in an environmentally responsible way.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para5"></a>My noble friend Lord Whitty was kindly and, I am sure, accurately, described as being a green person. I do not know whether the Committee will feel that I am green enough by the end of this debate, rather than grey enough, which is what I am usually accused of, but I want to give a number of assurances.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para6"></a>Having established my intention to claim some green credentials, I note that the word "exploitation", which is in many senses not a happy word and does not inspire a warm glow, none the less follows exactly the word used in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are simply reproducing that terminology. We certainly do not want to imply by it any suggestion of ruthless exploitation in the manner of either of the dictionary definitions that we have been offered.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para7"></a>Let me state categorically what will happen. The key points to bear in mind are these. First, we must address the big picture of climate change. Offshore renewables will play an important role in doing so. It would be foolish to claim that we will try to deal with climate change while suggesting that there will be no impact on anything else. That would be unrealistic and not <P>


<a name="column_GC320"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC320</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sensible. There is a potential impact, and it is a matter of getting the balance right, for all the reasons mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para8"></a>Secondly, I turn to the first possible impact, the visual impact, of development within the renewable energy zone. Zones will be limited to areas 22 kilometres offshore. I cannot speak for the quality of other people's eyesight, but I strongly suspect that I will not be able to detect a great deal 22 metres offshore.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-40_spnew4"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Kilometres.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-40_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   Did I say metres? I apologise. I could manage 22 metres; that is more or less the length of a cricket pitch&#151;plus a little bit&#151;and I have usually been able to see between the two sets of stumps. I mean 22 kilometres, which is a fair distance. Even with some wind generators being 150 metres high to the tip of the top blade when at its highest position, in almost no case will that present a visual eyesore from almost anywhere from which one might view the sea. It might be difficult to work out who should be polled on whether such a generator is suitable, because of the distance offshore.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para9"></a>I turn to my third point. Establishing the renewable energy zone is only an enabling provision; no decisions about how it will be developed will be made at this point. It does not pre-empt any decisions; its purpose is only as a legal step to facilitate consideration of whether developments are appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para10"></a>The fourth main point to bear in mind is that there are robust safeguards in place&#151;the SEA and EIA&#151;to ensure that the environmental impact of strategic environmental assessment of any proposed development is taken into account.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para11"></a>I now draw attention to how planning decisions are made. We certainly intend there to be a change in the role of the local authority in the consultation process to become a statutory consultee following the Bill's enactment. The position is clarified in the Bill. Local authorities will not be responsible for forcing a public inquiry, but they will certainly take part in them. That will be included by providing for it in secondary legislation rather than in the Bill. No attempt will be made to stop anyone with anything to say from making his objections known.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para12"></a>I am rather at a loss as to how to deal with the fifth point. I am unfamiliar with the history of fishing nets, although, standing in the Moses Room, I recognise that it draws their entire history to our attention. Plainly, it will be important to ensure for fish and other marine animals that all relevant considerations are taken fully into account.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para13"></a>The amendments would not achieve their objective, as they propose introducing environmental considerations too early in the process, when the REZ is established. They also run the risk of introducing such restrictive conditions that they might prevent any offshore renewable development from taking place. At that point, we lose the big picture by concentrating on a much smaller one.
<P>


<a name="column_GC321"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC321</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para14"></a>As I said, the renewable energy needed to address climate change cannot be said to be 100 per cent impact-free. However, I ask the Grand Committee to bear in mind why we are establishing the renewable energy zones. We want to be able to take advantage of the country's very considerable natural resources offshore&#151;the wind, waves and tidal currents&#151;to produce electricity in a truly sustainable way and without pumping carbon into the atmosphere. As the Committee will know, the Government have a goal of cutting CO2 emissions by 60 per cent by 2050. Offshore renewable energy technologies have an absolutely vital role to play in helping us to achieve that goal.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para15"></a>We have taken on the challenge of reducing carbon emissions in order to address the very real and serious environmental consequences and threats of climate change. The important issue is to get the balances right. We must balance the impact that developing offshore renewable energy may have on local marine environments against the potential climate change from fossil fuel generation if we do not develop the offshore renewables. The impact of wind farms, for example, will be managed and limited, because our assessment processes ensure that they are consented to only if that is so.
<P>

<a name="40203-40_para16"></a>In that light, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment&#151;not because the issues in it are not of the gravest importance; I fully accept that they are. However, the provisions available should make it possible to achieve all the objectives mentioned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-40_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I want to make two very small points. Amendment No. 106A suggests,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"at end insert 'in a manner which maintains the natural environment'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-40_para17"></a>
I can quite understand the words of the Minister about not wanting to make anything too prescriptive and prevent the proper actions that need to be taken to deal with climate change. Some alteration may be needed. However, the provision that Amendment No. 106B would affect states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'exploration' includes the doing of anything".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-40_para18"></a>
All Amendment No. 106B would do is insert after that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"which does not cause irreversible damage to the marine environment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-40_para19"></a><P>

<a name="40203-40_para20"></a>The Minister must think it all right for the Bill to state "anything". The amendment does not say, "which does not cause damage"&#151;that would be a different matter. But it would be dreadful if irreversible damage happened to the marine environment. I cannot see why the Minister cannot accept that amendment anyway.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-40_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   The Minister helpfully said that the renewable energy zones are no closer to the shore than 22 kilometres, and that they would therefore not be able to be seen from the shore. Could he envisage a situation in which there may be contiguous developments of wind farms, both in and outside territorial waters&#151;that is, on both sides of the line of the 22 kilometres? My noble friend Lady Byford has <P>


<a name="column_GC322"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>been saying that something may be visible from the shore. The Committee has demonstrated uncertainty about who is responsible for the planning of offshore wind farms, whether inside or outside territorial waters&#151;I hope that I have the terminology correct. That issue is eluding Members of the Committee.

<A NAME="40203-41_spnew0"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   The Minister was helpful in beginning to describe the renewable energy zones and the fact that they have to be more than 22 kilometres offshore. I wonder what the Government envisage with the zones. Will they be vast areas, perhaps hundreds of kilometres wide, or pockets in which the Government might encourage renewable energy development?
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para0"></a>The point made by my noble friend Lord Ullswater was about visibility, and the Minister suggested that something may not be noticed too much. However, I know that I have to go only 100 yards behind my house to see the chimney of Inverkip power station, which is not 150 metres high. Such things are noticeable.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   The other problem with what the Minister said&#151;I am sorry to have to trip him on this&#151;is that the coastline is not flat. There are plenty of places where the cliffs are 100 feet high, or even 200 or 300 feet high. Depending on where one was, one could see vastly further out to sea than if one were standing on one of the bleak east coast shores, which might be only a couple of feet above sea level.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I shall try to deal with the variety of points made. We are not dealing with the wind farms that would be closer to shore. I entirely accept that the ones far closer to shore&#151;I have seen some myself&#151;will certainly be visible. That is not the issue with which we are dealing in relation to the REZs. It is important to be as realistic as possible about the impact that the REZs may have.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para1"></a>I do not think that the zones will be vast areas of turbines, if that was the point of the question. They are areas in which it will be possible to site turbines. It would be unlikely and impractical, particularly given the engineering issues about bedding them firmly in a relatively shallow area of water, to envisage very large areas of that kind. An REZ can be from 12 miles out&#151;that is the 22-kilometre point&#151;to 200 miles out. It is simply a definition of an area in which wind farms can be located. The appropriate way to deal with concerns about where the zones are located and what the impact of any one of them might be is the consent process, rather than the designation of the REZ itself, which is about an area in which they might possibly be.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para2"></a>I probably ought to have said earlier&#151;I apologise for not doing so&#151;that, when views are sought on any of the projects, everyone will have an opportunity to comment and make their views clear through planning consents, which are provided under Schedule 8 to the Electricity Act. That remains an absolutely firm commitment.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para3"></a>I entirely take the point that the coastline is not flat. I suppose that that is one reason why I enjoy walking on it. It is very high in some places. However, although <P>


<a name="column_GC323"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC323</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from very high points it is possible to see a considerable distance, one has to get quite high and we are talking about quite a considerable distance. We are not talking about something that will be an ever-present eyesore in most circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am sorry, but I could take the noble Lord to a place in France where we would have to be only 90 feet above the sea to see the island of Corsica, which is more than 90 miles away.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   That is an offer too good to turn down. I am fond of both France and Corsica, and shall make my diary available after this sitting of the Grand Committee. I do not say that in certain atmospheric conditions it is not impossible to see quite long distances. However, having walked most coastal paths in England and a good few in Scotland, I can confirm that, generally, unless the atmospheric conditions are unusually good, it is not often that one can see very considerable distances. The great pleasure in the walking is, of course, what one can see, and the walk itself. None the less, I hope that the noble Lord will make good his offer when I approach him about it later to make the arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para4"></a>I shall now respond to Amendment No. 106B, on which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, commented. Clause 75(7) merely seeks to define what is meant by "exploration" in Clause 75(2). Wind farms cost many millions of pounds to construct. Before committing themselves to investing those large sums of money, developers must ensure that their planned site is viable. They will want, for example, to understand the character of the sea bed into which the wind turbines will be placed, and to measure wind speed. Those exploration activities are not likely to have a lasting effect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-41_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank the Minister for giving way when in full flow of his explanation. He said that Clause 75 merely deals with the exploration of areas. It does not; it refers to the exploitation of areas. Its heading uses the word "exploitation". That is the particular word that we did not like.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-41_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I ask the noble Baroness to forgive me. I stand corrected, but I do not think that it will alter the theme of the answer. Despite the fact that I do not much like the word either, although it is the word currently used in the circumstances, my point was as follows. The exploitation activities are unlikely to have a lasting effect on the marine environment. The early phases, in which people seek to establish whether the site is viable at all, will certainly not do so. If a structure such as a wind-speed measuring device is placed in the water, the developer must first obtain a licence under the Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985, which has been mentioned previously. Again, the necessary safeguards to protect the marine environment are already in place and most certainly should be used to do that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-41_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am very grateful to the Minister for the courteous way in which he has responded to the amendments, and to all Members of the Committee <P>


<a name="column_GC324"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC324</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who have commented on them. I understand the Minister's explanation about the use of the word "exploitation"; in fact, I have not asked for it to be removed. I am not breaching the UN convention, as it would still be there, but I seek merely to make a softer interpretation of what is a fairly barbaric word at present.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para5"></a>I hope that the Ministers will consider the matter before Report, because I do not think it would change their objective. It would merely pull people up short and tell them that exploitation must be carried out in a manner that maintains the natural environment. I do not think that the Minister, who is nodding, would disagree with that. I hope that the Government will return with a provision that accepts the thrust behind the amendment. I have not asked for the word to be removed; I have merely softened it. I shall leave the matter standing.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para6"></a>The Minister rightly said that at present renewable energy zones are not in being, but may be established. That makes me even more worried&#151;the Minister will get used to me after a while&#151;because I tend to like to have provisions written in the Bill. I get very worried when there are inferences or words such as "may". I call them Henry VIIIs, which is not technically correct, but I am always apprehensive when something is not as clear as I would like it to be on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para7"></a>The Minister said that local authorities will now be consultees on planning. Is he saying that that provision will be added, or is it already in the Bill without my having seen it? I did not pick up that the Bill defines that. Perhaps it relates to a previous Bill. Will the Minister respond on that? Is the provision not already in the Electricity Act 1989? It may well be, in which case he will clarify that for me. He will learn also that I do not like a provision being made through regulations if it can possibly be included in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para8"></a>In passing, the noble Lord mentioned fishing nets. Last autumn, there was grave concern about 100 dolphins that had been washed up in Cornwall. Some of the Bill overlaps with the question of fishing, which we shall come to in greater detail later. I accept that there is a huge role to be played in enlarging the holes in fishing nets so that certain fish will not be caught in them. I shall look very carefully at the Minister's response.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para9"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, did not like the use of the words "irreversible damage" in Amendment No. 102B. Perhaps we can think about that. But I do not like either the wording on page 58, line 35:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'exploration' includes the doing of anything".
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40203-41_para11"></a>My noble friend raised the point that the "doing of anything" is completely open-ended. I urge the Minister to give that issue serious thought.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para12"></a>As regards my Amendment No. 106G, I do not say that there should be no development because development there will be. I disagree with the Government's estimate of the amount of energy wind farms will produce and the amount of pollution they will reduce. Other methods were referred to in the debate on earlier amendments. I am being lobbied very <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>heavily by a company which is using waste to produce energy. When we have vast amounts of waste produced on a daily basis, surely it should be a high priority to use it for energy production and conservation. A great number of possibilities are being explored&#151;the Minister touched on some of them earlier&#151;of which wind farms are but one.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para13"></a>I am not saying that there should no wind farms. What I am seeking to do with my amendments is to draw attention to the fact that serious consideration should be given as to where they are sited. That is most important. Obviously there are not national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty all over the country. Some areas are less sensitive than others. The amendments seek a greater degree of clarity.
<P>

<a name="40203-41_para14"></a>I thank all noble Lords who have participated in the debate on the amendments. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) The Renewable Energy Zone shall only be the area necessary for efficient energy generation taking into account environmental impacts which shall have the provisions in this Bill applied to it."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-42_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment addresses an issue touched on earlier by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose. It seeks an answer from the Minister as to how big a renewable energy zone could be. There is nothing in the Bill to define the size of a zone. The amendment suggests that it should be only the area necessary for efficient energy generation.
<P>

<a name="40203-42_para2"></a>I accept that the wording of the amendment probably leaves something to be desired. I found difficulty in expressing how the zone should be limited within the context of the Bill. But if zones are not limited, we could end up with a renewable energy zone around the UK that takes in all the waters between the 12-mile and the 200-mile limits.
<P>

<a name="40203-42_para3"></a>If that is what the Government have in mind, we should know it; and, if there are to be little pockets of water, as the noble Duke put it, we should know that too. I have absolutely no idea what the Government have in mind. It is for that reason I have tabled the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-42_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   In my previous response I gave a slightly better indication. I said that the REZs will be from 12 miles to 200 miles out. I understand the point made by the noble Baroness that one can envisage a ring around the United Kingdom which encompasses all waters between those two limits.
<P>

<a name="40203-42_para4"></a>Again in earlier exchanges we noted that engineering realities dictated the siting of wind farms in areas where the sea is no more than 30 metres deep. It would not be an engineering practicality otherwise. For a very large part of the United Kingdom the shelving away from our coast is fairly abrupt. Scotland is a good example of this. There are very few areas that fall into the kind of category suitable for wind farms. <P>


<a name="column_GC326"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC326</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Although we do not have the benefit of a map today, I suggest that the mix of relatively shallow waters and those which are much more steeply shelved would indicate that the risk of there being a kind of Polo-mint effect around the country is not realistic.
<P>

<a name="40203-42_para5"></a>Amendment No. 106AZA seeks to restrict the renewable energy zone to the area necessary for efficient renewable energy generation. The creation of the REZ does not in itself indicate anything about where or how much development should take place within it. Clause 75 relates to the establishment of the renewable energy zone. Perhaps I may stress what I said in my response a few moments ago: the establishment of the REZ will not pre-empt any decisions about the appropriate scale or location of renewable energy development that may be considered within it. It is purely a legal step that needs to be taken to ensure the proper consideration of renewable energy projects beyond the limit of territorial waters at 12 nautical miles. I should add that nautical miles are rather longer than ordinary miles. It is not a stage at which plans are made for developing the zone so it is not a point at which any decisions are taken about environmental impact.
<P>

<a name="40203-42_para6"></a>The areas within the renewable energy zone identified for offshore renewable energy development will be established after an assessment has been made of the geographical location of the potential resource. Safeguards are already in place to make sure that appropriate consideration will be given to the impact on the environment of proposed renewable developments both before these regions of the sea are offered to developers to apply for site leases and then once developers have worked up their specific proposals and have applied for development consent so that we can see exactly what is involved in any proposal.
<P>

<a name="40203-42_para7"></a>I hope that this provides an adequate reassurance to noble Lords that the proposed amendment to limit the size of the renewable energy zone is unnecessary. I shall not make the point at greater length because I believe that we have already been over a number of the key issues of definition during our previous discussion. However, the point I seek to make is that this is not the point at which the whole consent system would be at its most effective.

<A NAME="40203-42_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. It is still not entirely clear whether the zones will in effect be limited or unlimited in size. I shall read his response carefully. When people want to check on a map what areas the Minister has designated as renewable energy zones, I hope that they will be able to see them. The question of the limit to a zone and whether that will be defined anywhere, such as on a map, or whether it will remain something in the Minister's mind, is a matter to which, in the light of his reply, I shall probably have to return on Report. In the mean-time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40203-42_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty </B>   moved Amendment No. 106AA:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 58, line 28, leave out "An Order in Council under this section is" and insert "Orders in Council under this section, and orders under subsection (5), are".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40203-42_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40203-42_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment has been tabled to correct an oversight. Clause 75(5) provides an order-making power so that the Secretary of State can delineate that part of a renewable energy zone around the UK in which Scottish Ministers are to have functions; for example, in relation to the application of civil and criminal law under Clauses 76 and 78, or consultation in respect of decommissioning in Clauses 92 and 98. In drafting the Bill we omitted to provide a parliamentary procedure for such orders. We propose that these orders should be subject to the negative resolution procedure. This is in line with the procedure for Orders in Council under Clause 75(4) which designate the renewable energy zone. The Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform has seen the amendment and is satisfied with it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-42_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I wish to question the Minister on a matter about which I warned him that I was not absolutely clear. Exactly how will Scots Ministers be enabled to do that? I understand that they will be consulted by the Secretary of State, but is the Order in Council laid by the Secretary of State at Westminster? I take it that the Scots Parliament will not lay an Order in Council. As a subsidiary Parliament, can it not do that? I am interested in how it works, so I wanted to be clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-42_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   This issue may arise later. In this context we are talking about the United Kingdom power of delineation and designation of the zones and indicating in which of those zones that part of the responsibilities would thereafter fall to Scottish Ministers. This clause covers only the UK power of delineation, which is through an Order in Council in the Westminster Parliament. Thereafter, issues of enforcement under the Scottish laws can arise, but this clause concerns solely a UK power. It might be better if I elaborate on how the Scottish Parliament can also use an Order in Council when we come later to a slightly more complicated set of amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-42_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I thank the noble Lord very much for that. I am sorry if I was confused, but it is important that we understand the matter. It is only recently, since devolution, that those issues have occurred. In this case the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will lay an Order in Council, having consulted Scots Ministers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-42_spnew7"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   This is a fascinating concept as regards the question of devolution. At present, there is a clear line of delineation between which territorial waters out to 12 miles are Scottish and which belong to the UK. At present, waters beyond the 12-mile limit are reckoned to be UK territory. Is the Minister saying that Scotland will be given a slice of the waters beyond the 12-mile limit to look after? Will the Scottish hegemony be extended over a wider area?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-42_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I would not encourage the noble Duke or the Scottish Parliament to extend the Scottish <P>


<a name="column_GC328"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC328</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hegemony over any wider an area than it already has. The point is that the designation of the areas is a UK responsibility because the waters beyond that area belong to the UK. But the enforcement of certain aspects of environmental protection, for example, will fall to Scottish Ministers and agencies. This clause deals only with the delineation, which is clearly a UK power.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-42_spnew9"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   Forgive me if I have misunderstood, but I thought that these areas would be outwith the 12-mile limit and therefore not in Scottish waters at all. I do not see why Scottish law is required.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-42_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   There are already law-at-sea arrangements whereby Scottish law rather than English law applies in certain marine circumstances. Those would apply in this situation also. It is not a new concept in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-42_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   As a subjunct to the point made by my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour, I am confused. Subsection (5) talks about orders made by the Secretary of State, while subsection (4) provides for Orders in Council. Clearly an order made by the Secretary of State is a lesser beast than one made by Her Majesty in Council. However, given devolution and the situation in Scotland, why can the Secretary of State, off his own bat, produce an order for Scotland whereas any other must come from Her Majesty in Council?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Subsection (4) relates to designation which is provided by an Order in Council, while subsection (5) indicates which of those designations would have administrative functions for the Scottish Executive. The original Order in Council is then subject to the negative procedure in the Bill as drafted. We are also making the other part of this subject to the negative procedure so that there is a consistency of process throughout the clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-43_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I certainly understand what the amendment will do. I am asking what the Bill does, and why.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-43_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The Order in Council will provide the designation. The implications of the designation, which are a lesser issue, are that Scottish Ministers will have jurisdiction in relation to devolved matters within those zones. So the international waters element is dealt with by Order in Council, while the Secretary of State is then responsible for the administrative arrangements. However, they would both be subject to the same parliamentary process if the amendment is accepted.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40203-43_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of this amendment is to explore the effect of the Energy Bill on the responsibilities of the Crown Estate as laid down in the Crown Estates Act 1961. It asks whether this Bill will need to amend those powers.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para3"></a>I have tabled the amendment because, under the terms of the Bill, the Crown Estate will be able to license areas of the sea bed in the renewable energy zones for the purpose of exploring and exploiting&#151;that word again&#151;the UK's wind, wave and tidal resources for the production of energy. However, the Crown Estates Act 1961 requires the Crown Estate Commissioners to maintain and enhance the estate's value and the returns obtained from it. In other words, the commissioners will have to operate a strict policy of maximising financial gain, regardless of community interests.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para4"></a>It is in particular regard to community interests in the northern isles and perhaps elsewhere in Britain, as they have been explained to me, that I have tabled the amendment. The fact that the Crown Estate Commissioners have to secure the best returns possible from rental of the sea bed is likely to mean that there will be a bias in favour of the much larger generators proposed for very extensive wind farms. Based on economies of scale, they will be able to generate much larger returns and more significant profits from which the Crown Estate Commissioners can derive greater charges.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para5"></a>This issue was first raised in Scotland, but it may have an impact in several areas. Local communities are interested in deriving benefits from wind, tidal and wave energy sources. Given that, it would be very unfortunate if the Crown Estates Act 1961 meant that those communities did not benefit as much as they should from the development of these resources in their waters. That will be the case if the Crown Estate Commissioners raise money from the estate. Any income derived will become a cash cow for the Treasury rather than feeding back into local communities. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-43_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   Amendment No. 106AB would exclude the Crown Estate from playing a role in the development of renewable energy zones. I consider that such a move would be short-sighted and we wish to resist this amendment. It might be helpful if I remind Members of the Committee of the role that the Crown Estate plays now in the process of developing offshore renewable energy.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para6"></a>The Crown Estate owns the sea bed out to the 12-mile limit of the territorial sea. Perhaps I may put it this way: it acts as the landowner for the sea bed. Developers who wish to construct, say, a wind farm must enter into an agreement with the Crown Estate for the lease of the area of the sea bed where the structure will be placed. Naturally, developers are charged a rental for the use of the sea bed in the same way that any landowner would also make a charge for <P>


<a name="column_GC330"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC330</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>use of his property. That, together with other Crown Estate revenues, is paid to the Consolidated Fund at the end of each financial year.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para7"></a>The Crown Estate and the DTI are working closely together in developing the framework for expansion of the offshore wind energy industry. Members of the Committee may know that as late as last July the Trade Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, invited the Crown Estate to hold a tender for sites for offshore wind farms in three strategic areas&#151;that is, the Greater Wash, the Thames Estuary and the area broadly from the north Wales coast to the Solway Firth.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para8"></a>Those areas were selected by the DTI as offering the best prospects for wind development based on factors such as the prevailing wind resource, water depth and the capacity for grid connections. Just before Christmas, the Crown Estate offered leases for 15 sites to successful applicants. In due course those developers will apply to government departments, including the DTI, for the consents necessary for the projects to be built.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para9"></a>This co-operative arrangement is working very well and we see no reason to change it. The Government set the energy policy framework and regulate individual projects, while the Crown Estate manages the sea bed and gives the site leases. It makes very good sense for those arrangements to be adopted for the renewable energy zone beyond the territorial waters.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para10"></a>It is very important that there is a common regime in the territorial waters and for the renewable energy zone. We want to create a single level playing field for development no matter where projects are located. The effect of the amendment would be to have some differential arrangement in the renewable energy zone, although, from the way in which the amendment was spoken to, it is not clear that that is what the amendment proposes.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para11"></a>I think that I must correct the notion that there would be a conflict of interest in the way that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has described. The Crown Estate's rent must be the best consideration&#151;I emphasise this&#151;reasonably obtainable in all the circumstances as set out in the Crown Estate Act 1961. It must exclude any element of monopoly value attribution to the extent of the Crown's ownership of comparable land. But, critically, it must be the best consideration reasonably obtainable in all the circumstances. Plainly, that includes overall considerations about whether it is a proper site or whether the site would be developed in a way that would cause considerable difficulty or offence to people who live locally&#151;for example, by the installation of over-large machines.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para12"></a>In the three areas that I mentioned, there was tremendous interest from developers in the round 2 tender for offshore wind farms. Many more developers applied for leases than it was possible to grant. There is strong evidence that the rental is not acting as a barrier to development, nor is it being exploited in a way that is likely to act as a barrier. Those who are serious in wanting to put up a wind farm will not be deterred by extortionate rental levels.

<P>

<a name="40203-43_para13"></a>The Crown Estate has given an undertaking that it will monitor and review the effect of the rental payments on the development of the wind industry. Should any kind of evidence emerge suggesting that the viability of future development is being impeded by the rental level, or that some unreasonable arrangement is being made of the kind suggested as a possibility by the noble Baroness, the Crown Estate will consider whether revision of the rental would be justified.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para14"></a>I hope that those are reasonable assurances that sensible people are co-operating in this, and that there are provisions in legislation which would stop the exploitation&#151;to use that word again&#151;of these resources in a way that would cause offence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-43_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I was listening carefully to what the noble Lord said, but I have some difficulty in understanding it. Are we to understand that there are competitive tenders for any given tranche? If so, how is the concept of excessive charges or excessive rental levels to be established? I should have thought that if there were a competitive tender, that would be the appropriate amount. Is it a market process? Or are the Government, in some way, imposing a limit, saying that they will not charge the full amount that they could obtain in order to ensure that some development takes place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-43_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   No, my Lords. I hope that I have not given that impression at all, but if I have, I apologise. It is a tendering process, but it is also a process where the development must receive various kinds of planning consent. Those are unquestionably considerations that would have to be taken into account in the construct of considerations reasonably obtainable in the circumstances. There is a balance.
<P>

<a name="40203-43_para15"></a>I am not sure whether that analogy is 100 per cent accurate, but I am trying to give the best illustration that I can in response to the noble Lord's question. It is probably like a proposal to develop a piece of land. A development might be proposed that would produce very high commercial returns but would be unacceptable on that piece of land. If it is unacceptable, of course that development cannot take place and those returns cannot be achieved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-43_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. I had better read exactly what he has said. But, if, on environmental grounds, a limit is imposed on the amount that can be charged, several people may wish to have the asset at that price.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-44_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My point is that the environmental considerations are free-standing, not that there is a limit to what can be charged by virtue of the environmental considerations. The environmental considerations will determine the merits of whether to proceed with a particular development. That might have an impact on the amount that reasonably can be realised by people tendering. They will have to take into account those environmental factors in framing what they bid in the tender. The tender process is not <P>


<a name="column_GC332"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC332</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about bidding by developers for the site. The rental fee is set out, and bidders can compete on the basis of the quality of their proposals within that framework.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-44_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Perhaps I may follow my noble friend a little further on that line. I am getting more mystified. Am I right in saying that the Minister said that 15 approvals have been given already? If I can put it in simple language, more people want to take on the projects than there are places available. Further to my noble friend's comments, I wish to know whether the base of rental was put too low. Who decided the rate? Or have I missed the point altogether? That is where I am getting more mystified.
<P>

<a name="40203-44_para0"></a>For example, when mobile telephones were introduced, the amounts charged for the masts were absolutely huge. Ultimately, it was realised that they were not a commercial viability and, if I remember correctly, many businesses went bust. In fact, the reverse is happening here. More people want to do business than there are places available. As regards the very good amendment raised by the noble Baroness, how was the process devised in the first place? Can we have clarification on that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-44_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Perhaps I may help my noble friend. My understanding of the Crown Estate is that it is like any other landlord. It is an extremely good landlord and extremely sensitive to environmental issues. That is why there are so few complaints about what the Crown Estate does. My understanding is that, in this case, there would be competitive tendering within the constraints of the planning requirements and the highest bids would win, providing they were adequate. So of course there were more bids; everyone wants to develop wind farms. That is the Crown Estate's point of view. If I am wrong about that, perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee. I feel strongly about this issue. The Crown Estate is like any other landlord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-44_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   Perhaps I can explain to the Minister why we are confused. He seems to be saying, "We will set a price and then see which of the people who want to accept at that price produce the best environmental outcome". If that is what he is saying&#151;it appeared to be what he read out&#151;that is a strange concept. If you impose a limit on a price, you may well get more than one person who wants to buy the asset at that price.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-44_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour. I understand that the Crown Estate is a good landlord. It has done an immense amount to clean up beaches, for instance, by promoting the blue flag scheme and so on. So I do not intend by my amendment to question its credentials in that area.
<P>

<a name="40203-44_para1"></a>Perhaps I may use the Minister's analogy of a piece of land because that is easier to imagine. As I understand it, under the 1961 Act, the Crown Estate is bound to get the best possible price for a piece of land, for whatever use. If there are two private bidders, the highest one gets it. But supposing that the community also wants to build a school on it; is the Crown Estate <P>


<a name="column_GC333"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC333</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>able to sell it to the community for a lower price? That is my question. If the community in some isolated place wants to build their own renewable energy source, can the Crown Estate let them have that bit of the sea bed at a lower price?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-44_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I hope that I can carve my way through the various issues that have been raised. My initial response was to the case made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, who suggested that there could be a conflict between the Crown Estate as landlord and its obligation under the law to do its best in commercial terms. I pointed out that there are other considerations in legislation concerning what the Crown Estate can and cannot do that go beyond the simple principle of getting the highest possible amount of money for the property. That may have inadvertently led to an exploration of the subject that goes onto different terrain. It is important to clear that up.
<P>

<a name="40203-44_para2"></a>I certainly share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, of how the Crown Estate operates. Incidentally, I do not think that a case could realistically be presented by a local community that it wanted to build wind farms 22 kilometres off the coast. We are not here dealing with alternatives; we are dealing with the most appropriate way for large commercial providers to deal with the problem. With great respect, I shall focus on that because that is the most realistic prospect.
<P>

<a name="40203-44_para3"></a>Let me set out how the Crown Estate has proceeded. I may be able to answer most, if not all, of the questions posed. First, the Crown Estate arrived at a fixed fee per square kilometre for rental. It worked on and decided what should be the fixed fee per kilometre. The rental was set by the Crown Estate as the appropriate value for the site compared with alternative uses. I do not today, as the Committee will understand, have greater detail about the entire process it went through to make those comparisons but, knowing its quality as a landlord, I have no doubt it was done with the usual thoroughness.

<P>
<A NAME="40203-44_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   I hesitate to interrupt the noble Lord. He is putting forward a normal opportunity-cost argument, but this particular site does not have any alternative use.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-44_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I was trying to be candid in saying that I do not have in front of me the entire set of criteria which I have no doubt the Crown Estate worked through in making an opportunity-cost analysis of the alternatives. I cannot rule out that there may not be other alternatives; I cannot speculate what they might be either.

<a name="40203-44_para5"></a>We are told that the Crown Estate set the appropriate value for the sites by comparing the alternative uses and coming to a conclusion. I hope that the Committee will recognise the two examples I have given.
<P>

<a name="40203-44_para6"></a>The site allocation&#151;this is where we come to the nub of some of the questions that have been asked&#151;was then made on the basis of the quality of the project and the environmental impact. Those are the issues that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said were often in the forefront of the Crown Estate's mind when it takes decisions. The overall allocation is limited by the strategic environmental assessment, not by how much is paid. I have made the point that the amount paid per square kilometre was set by the use of criteria as to appropriate or viable alternative uses. After that it was decided among those who made bids on the basis of the quality of the project and the environmental impact, limited by the strategic environmental assessment.

<a name="40203-44_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment relates to the purpose of Clauses 76 and 78 and is intended to clarify a position relating to Scottish powers. The clauses apply criminal and civil law to offshore renewable energy installations and, in the case of civil law, to cabling. Both clauses provide for an Order in Council procedure to give flexibility to the process so that properly considered decisions can be taken about which aspects of the criminal or civil law it is necessary or appropriate to apply. Clause 76 also provides for the extension of police powers and privileges, again by an Order in Council procedure.
<P>

<a name="40203-44_para13"></a>Both clauses apply to renewable energy installations wholly or partly in offshore waters, including the Scottish part of the renewable energy zone. An Order in Council could potentially cover civil or criminal law matters that are wholly reserved under the Scotland Act 1998, wholly devolved or a mix of both. We are legislating for devolved matters with the agreement of Scottish Ministers, and a Motion under the Sewel Convention is being considered by the Scottish Parliament.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40203-44_para14"></a>We need to provide for an appropriate procedure in all three circumstances: where an Order in Council covers reserved matters; where it covers devolved matters; and where it involves both. We now recognise that the Bill as drafted is deficient in that respect, so we propose by way of these amendments to remove the existing provisions and to introduce a new clause covering Orders in Council for both criminal and civil law. The clause sets out the parliamentary procedure to be followed depending on the subject matter. In the case of wholly reserved matters the Order in Council would be subject to the negative resolution procedure in the Westminster Parliament, as we discussed earlier. Where the Order in Council deals with wholly devolved matters it would be subject to annulment of a resolution of the Scottish Parliament. Where the content of the Order in Council includes both reserved and devolved matters it would need to be subject to the procedures of both the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments. The new clause clarifies the position as compared with the original draft and makes a flexible provision that covers all three circumstances. Each of the three circumstances will require different procedures or combinations of procedures.

<A NAME="40203-45_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My noble friend wants to speak to this group of amendments that the Minister has approved. She understands that later on she will not be able to move her amendment and get the Committee to agree to it, but she can speak to the group.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-45_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   As I understand the Deputy Chairman's ruling, the amendments are grouped together, so the noble Baroness is entitled to speak to her amendments.

<P>

<a name="40203-45_para0"></a>I shall speak to my two amendments and comment on the government amendments. The Minister knows very well that my amendments were tabled well in advance of the government amendments&#151;I do not think that there is anything between us in that regard. If, anyone can table amendments with the result that another amendment cannot be taken as was intended, it obviously does not pay to table amendments until the last minute. I do not think that either the Government or the department would want that, but I urge that a little thought be given to those of us who have done our work in advance but suddenly find <P>


<a name="column_GC336"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column GC336</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>themselves overtaken by events. That might happen on Report, but it is extraordinary that it should happen in Committee.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para1"></a>In Committee, we normally table amendments at a point when the Government have not put down many of their own. They listen to the discussions in Committee and then come back on Report with new or altered amendments. However, that has not happened at all in this Bill. It is extremely difficult. I see that the Minister is shaking his head. I have never known so many. It is nearly like saying that the Government are altering their Bill before we have actually had a chance to debate it.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para2"></a>At Second Reading the general, overall thrust of what the Bill is about was outlined; the Committee stage gives us a chance to table amendments, to hang hats on pegs and to debate the issues that we need to raise. I have never seen so many government amendments walloped-in at the Committee stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-45_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I do not recognise the noble Baroness's description of other Bills. On almost every Bill&#151; particularly Bills that start in the House of Lords&#151;there are government amendments very early in the proceedings. This is because we recognise early on that there is a deficiency in drafting. It is for the convenience of the House&#151;and of Grand Committees at this stage&#151;that the Government put that right at the earliest possible opportunity. There is no serious policy issue here. The problem is the procedural issue that arises through the interaction of Scottish and UK procedures.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para3"></a>As to the issue of pre-emption, I am afraid that the Government are always in the same position as others in the House&#151;pre-emption is never absolutely clear until it is enunciated from the Chair. That applies to any Bill at any stage. I do not believe that we are in new territory here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-45_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I accept that quiet rebuke and take it in the spirit in which it was offered. I have not participated in many Bills that have started at this end and so I may not have come across the problem quite so much. The noble Lord is much more experienced than I am and no doubt has.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para4"></a>I turn now to speak to Amendments Nos. 106C and 106D. The Minister has spoken to his amendments. I am grateful to him because obviously one of them does exactly what I seek to do with Amendment No. 106C. Can the Minister confirm that his amendments will ensure that the application of criminal law will be the same in all UK territorial waters? It is quite amazing that the Bill as published can make the definition of criminal activity in Scottish waters subject, in effect, to a veto from Scottish Ministers. It is even more amazing that the Bill lays down that the Secretary of State has only to "consult" Scottish Ministers if he wishes the NDA to work on a Scottish site. That provision can be found on page 6, in Clause 6(3). By the time this issue arises in the House we will have dealt with the Minister's amendments, which we are still debating. I therefore do not need to further enlarge on that issue.

<P>

<a name="40203-45_para5"></a>Moving on to Amendment No. 106D, although the Minister's amendments would remove subsection (10) altogether I hope that he can clarify something for me. The point of my amendment is merely to raise again the situation where what is acceptable in English and Welsh law is not necessarily acceptable in Scottish law. Its effect is to create a renewable energy policy which is not a devolved matter, but which contains contiguous matters that are. In Clause 76, the contiguous matter is the definition of criminal activity in, on, over or under the territorial sea in the region of an offshore wind turbine installation.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para6"></a>The nonsense is that it would be possible for there to be a wind turbine installation that covered an area partly adjacent to England and partly adjacent to Scotland. It would then be possible to make an Order in Council which classified&#151;this is a very silly example&#151;throwing stones as a criminal activity. If Scottish Ministers did not agree, that activity would not be criminal in that part of the installation which was in Scottish waters.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para7"></a>Perhaps the Minister will enlighten me as to whether pursuit of an offender from English to Scottish waters would be allowed&#151;or is that something else that, having been devolved, Scottish Ministers can prevent?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-45_spnew6"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I have a question on the drafting. I have been trying to understand the Government's amendment, which states:

<A NAME="40203-45_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I realise that the Government have been discussing this whole matter with the Scots Parliament, and doubtless with the Lord Advocate, and that that is how they came to the conclusion that the Bill is wrong. I could not understand it originally and I am sorry to say that I do not quite understand now. Who lays the Order in Council which is wholly related to the Scots Parliament? Can the Scots Parliament lay an Order in Council direct to the Privy Council and Her Majesty? That was my concern. I think that that is a very interesting legal point. Otherwise, subject to what my noble friend the Duke of Montrose has advised, I am satisfied that they have found an answer.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para9"></a>I am sorry that my noble friend has had such an annoying time working out what was wrong with the Bill and has found that the Government have found the answer after she tabled her amendments. That is very annoying for her and I can understand her being rather irritated. However, I am very grateful if the Government have found the answer. This is a very interesting devolution issue where you have three different sorts of circumstances that involve both <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Parliaments in different ways. So I should simply like to know who lays an Order in Council that is concerned only with the Scots Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-45_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Where it is a purely devolved matter the Scottish Parliament would consider a resolution on an Order in Council and that would be subject to annulment if the Parliament did not agree. Bringing forward that Order in Council would be a procedure solely for the Scottish Parliament. The parliamentary procedure is slightly different from ours but it has the same effect in that the Scottish Ministers will propose a resolution to put to Parliament and Parliament can accept or reject it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-45_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Does the Order in Council laid by the Scots Parliament go straight to Her Majesty or does it have to come through Westminster?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-45_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   It goes to the council. It does not come through the Westminster Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para10"></a>On the question of different laws applying, the criminal law in Scotland has been different from the criminal law in England since the Act of Union or before. We are not in new territory here at all. A criminal offence involving a boat that puts in to Peterhead will be handled under Scottish law, but if the boat travels south and lands at Newcastle it will be dealt with under English law. It is clear that the noble Baroness's amendment would have dealt with the criminal law aspect but not with the civil law aspect. Although she would have dealt with part of the matter, she would not have dealt with all of it.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para11"></a>We have dealt with it by deletion and by replacement with the new clause in Amendment No. 106EB. That replaces the whole procedure for both clauses&#151;to answer the noble Duke's question&#151;in one place. I think that that is probably a tidier way of doing it&#151;albeit that this is a complex area.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para12"></a>The situation about which the noble Baroness expresses horror&#151;that the Scottish criminal courts and Scottish civil courts would do things slightly differently from English courts&#151;is not a result of devolution but has always prevailed. As for areas that are subject to both, the British have a geographical issue which will have to be dealt with in the same way as is the ship. Usually, however, we would deal with it in an Order in Council that perhaps dealt partly with a devolved matter and partly with a UK matter.
<P>

<a name="40203-45_para13"></a>Therefore, the devolved matter would be a Scottish matter and the UK matter would be a UK matter and dealt with accordingly. A purely criminal law issue would be dealt with by Scotland and a purely civil law issue would be dealt with by Scotland in areas in Scottish territorial waters or the Scottish part of a renewable energy zone. I hope that that greatly clarifies the position.

<a name="40203-46_para10"></a>The energy White Paper first annual report will be published shortly after the Easter Recess. This will allow the Government to report on a full year from the launch of the White Paper in February 2003, as we are legally required to do by the Sustainable Energy Act 2003, as well as to capture some key energy statistics for the relevant period. Given the importance of energy efficiency to delivery of the energy White Paper objectives, the Government intend to publish the energy efficiency implementation plan at the same time as the annual report. The Government also envisage simultaneous publication of the fuel poverty strategy implementation plan and the CHP strategy.

<P>
<P>
<UL><P></UL>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-46_spmin3"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  The Child Trust Funds Bill will ensure that every child, whatever their family background, will have access at the age of 18 when they begin their adult life to a stock of assets which they can invest in their future. The child trust fund will also help children and their parents to understand the benefits of saving and investment and how to engage with financial institutions.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para39"></a>The Government are today publishing draft child trust fund regulations. These draft regulations will be of particular interest to potential providers of the child trust fund.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para40"></a>The draft regulations include the requirements for a stakeholder child trust fund account. Every child trust fund provider will make a stakeholder account available as one of the investment options. A stakeholder child trust fund account will have its charges capped at 1.5 per cent per year, and providers will be required to accept all contributions of &#163;10 and above. No charges will apply to transfers between different types of accounts, including from stakeholder to non-stakeholder, and between providers.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para41"></a>The Government's decision on the charge cap is in the best interests of consumers, as it encourages as wide a selection of providers as possible to offer child trust fund accounts. A large number of providers will encourage competition and ensure the best value for consumers. The Government will continue to monitor that the level of the charge cap best meets the interests of consumers.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para42"></a>The decision was evidence-based and considered the particular characteristics of the child trust fund. The economics of the child trust fund are very different from other financial products, such as the stakeholder pensions. In particular, child trust fund accounts will <P>


<a name="column_WS23"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column WS23</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be smaller in terms of the average size of funds compared to pensions and will have a lower minimum contribution level than other stakeholder products.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para43"></a>The evidence on which the decision for the cap was based included the report commissioned by the Government from Deloitte, which looked at the trade-offs of different charge caps for providers and consumers. Deloitte's report will be published later this year, at the same time as its report on the other products in the stakeholder suite.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para44"></a>The minimum contribution for the stakeholder account has been set to ensure the child trust fund is accessible to all savers, including those who cannot commit to regular contributions. Providers will be free to accept lower contributions if they wish and it is expected that competition among providers could drive down the minimum amounts accepted.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para45"></a>The Government will continue to work with the Financial Services Authority on the development of an appropriate regulatory regime.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para46"></a>Copies of the draft regulations together with an explanatory commentary are available in the Printed Paper Office and the Libraries of the House.

<P>

<UL><P></UL>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203-46_spmin4"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  On 8 December 2003 the UN General Assembly in Resolution ES-10/14 requested the International Court of Justice to urgently render an advisory opinion on the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory. In response to the request, the International Court of Justice has invited UN member states, Palestine, and certain international organisations to contribute written and/or oral statements to the court if they wish to do so. On 30 January the UK submitted a national written <P>


<a name="column_WS24"></a>

<B>3 Feb 2004 : Column WS24</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>statement to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para49"></a>As we have repeatedly made clear, here and elsewhere, the UK considers the building by Israel of a fence, or wall, in the West Bank to be unlawful. The UK's written statement submitted to the court recalls that we voted in favour of UN General Assembly Resolution ES-10/13, adopted on 21 October 2003, which demands that Israel stop and reverse construction of the wall in the occupied Palestinian territory. I regret that Israel has not complied with the General Assembly's demand. We recognise Israel's legitimate security concerns. The latest, horrifying suicide bombing in Jerusalem on 29 January only too clearly shows the continuing threat faced by Israel from terrorists. But building the fence on occupied land only complicates efforts to make progress towards a comprehensive peace settlement.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para50"></a>Despite our view on the illegalities of the fence, we argued against this question being referred to the International Court of Justice. This approach is one shared by all members of the European Union including all accession states. This is being communicated by the Irish presidency to the court. The UK has also submitted a detailed written statement to the court arguing that the court ought to exercise its discretion to decline to give an opinion. Our arguments are about the use of the court's advisory jurisdiction. We believe that it is inappropriate to embroil the court in a heavily political bilateral dispute. We also believe the court should not be engaged where the consent of both parties has not been given. An opinion is not necessary to assist the General Assembly in reaching a view on the fence. Nor, in the absence of participation from one side, will the court have all the facts before it.
<P>

<a name="40203-46_para51"></a>Submissions to the International Court of Justice are confidential until the court decides to make them public. We expect the court will make the written statements submitted to it public at the start of the oral proceedings, due to begin on 23 February. At that stage, we will place a copy in the Library of the House.

<A NAME="40203-47_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40203-47_para2"></a>We are making an important administrative change to the recruitment and re-engagement procedures for the Volunteer Reserve Forces. From 1 April this year, new recruits to the Volunteer Reserve Forces and applicants for re-engagement will be required to agree to their unit contacting their employer about their membership. The purpose of contacting employers is to ensure that they are aware of those employees who are members of the Volunteer Reserve Forces and to provide information about training and call-out liabilities.
<P>

<a name="40203-47_para3"></a>As a safeguard, reservists will have a right to submit cases to their commanding officers if they believe that they have particular reasons for not having their membership of the Volunteer Reserve Forces disclosed. Cases will be considered on their merits.
<P>

<a name="40203-47_para4"></a>This change to our administrative procedures will enable employers to be in a better position to plan for the absence of employees who are reservists and to be better informed about their rights and obligations. It <P>

<A NAME="40203-47_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40203-47_para5"></a>Further to my Answer to the honourable Member for Aldershot (Mr Howarth) of 21 January 2004 (Col. 1244W), the proposals set out in the Treasury and Inland Revenue document, <i>Simplifying the taxation of pensions: the Government's proposals</i>, published on 10 December 2003, would allow all such pension guarantee lump sum payments to continue to be paid free of income tax, subject to the proposed &#163;1.4 million lifetime allowance.

<P>

<a name="40203-47_para6"></a>The original Answer was incorrect following advice from officials across government, and I unreservedly apologise for this inaccurate Answer.
<P>

<a name="40203-47_para7"></a>The new Armed Forces Pension Scheme currently in Committee stage will in the event of the member's death, be able to pay both death-in-service lump sums of the type already paid under existing pension arrangements and the new pension guarantee lump sums applicable in cases of death in retirement, without any income tax charge. So, subject to the &#163;1.4 million allowance, the rate will not be 35 per cent but zero.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Laird  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>What steps they are taking to eradicate ageism in the Northern Ireland workplace.[HL729]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203w01_spmin0"></A><B> The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos):</B>  The Government are committed to addressing ageism in the Northern Ireland workplace through a range of measures including bringing legislation into line with the European Union Employment Framework Directive, the work of the Promoting Social Inclusion (PSI) Working Group on Older People and the NI Age Positive Campaign. The Age Positive Campaign is being launched on 27 January 2004 and is aimed at raising employers' awareness of the business benefits of an age-diverse workforce.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203w01_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Laird  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>Whether the Northern Ireland Civil Service has the authority to redesignate its 144 smoking rooms for other purposes without agreement from trade unions; and, if so, whether they will redesignate these rooms before they start to consider restricting smoking in public places.[HL734]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  The Northern Ireland Civil Service has the authority to redesignate its smoking rooms which were first introduced following a ban on smoking in all offices and common areas. However, the Northern Ireland Civil Service would always consult with the trade unions in respect of the implementation of changes such as this.
<P>

<a name="40203w01_para0"></a>The timing of any action to redesignate smoking rooms and the wider promotion of smoke-free public places are not interdependent. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety launched a five-year tobacco action plan in July 2003. It was prepared by an inter-sectoral working group and includes a series of actions designed to promote the provision of smoke-free policies. An implementation group, chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, has been established to take forward the agreed actions. A copy of the plan has been placed in the House Library.

<A NAME="40203w01_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Hylton  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What measures they are taking to curb racially motivated attacks and violence in Northern Ireland; and whether they agree with the Commission for Racial Equality that racist attacks are approximately one-third more prevalent in Northern Ireland, as compared with England and Wales.[HL756]<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_WA92"></a>

<UL><FONT SIZE=3><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  The Northern Ireland Office, the Northern Ireland departments and the Police Service of Northern Ireland are taking a range of actions. These include measures aimed at curbing and mitigating the impact of racist incidents through education, housing, health and social policy, as well as through law enforcement.
<P>

<a name="40203w01_para1"></a>For example, the Community Safety Strategy, being implemented through the Community Safety Unit of the Northern Ireland Office, identified Key Issue 6: Offences Motivated by Prejudice and Hatred as a central theme in making Northern Ireland a safer place for all its citizens. Specifically, it seeks to reduce the levels of crime motivated by sectarianism, and to promote and enhance the safety of minority ethnic residents. Currently, it is facilitating a working group of relevant Northern Ireland departments, voluntary and statutory organisations which aims to establish a clear framework for the recording and monitoring of racial incidents. It is hoped to bring forward such an agreed framework by the spring 2004. Also, within its community safety grant programme, the Challenge Competition, it has provided funding towards four projects which have a central theme of countering prejudice and hatred, at a total value of &#163;273,255.
<P>

<a name="40203w01_para2"></a>In addition to these initiatives, the Government will publish shortly for consultation, draft proposed legislation for Northern Ireland aimed at tackling racially motivated offences. The proposed draft order will require sentencers, where offences are aggravated by such hostility, to treat racial and religious hostility as an aggravating factor when sentencing. (The legislation will also cover offences motivated by hatred of sexual orientation.) The proposal will also increase maximum sentences available for certain specified, mainly violent, offences including where hostility based on racial, religious or sexual aggravation is proven.
<P>

<a name="40203w01_para3"></a>Direct comparisons of the prevalence of racist attacks across different jurisdictions can be difficult to make, but it would appear that racist attacks are more prevalent in Northern Ireland. Any attacks are unacceptable. The Government are committed to creating a safer and more tolerant Northern Ireland.

(1) Financial years in respect of Northern Ireland.<P>

(2) The Prison Service in England and Wales employs the term "self-inflicted death" rather than "suicide". This includes all those deaths where it appears the person may have acted specifically to take his/her own life.<P>

(3) There is no definition of what constitutes "attempted suicide", therefore data recording incidents of "attempted suicide" are effectively subsumed within those for self-harm, which covers all acts of self-injury, however serious. The figures provided are number of incidents of self-harm, not number of individuals. Data on self-harm were not available in this format before 1998.<P>

(4) The Prison Service in Northern Ireland utilises verdicts from the coroner's court. They are still awaiting verdicts on deaths in custody in respect of one prisoner in 2000, one in 2001 and three in 2003.<P>

(5) To 31 November 2003 only. In December 2002 new procedures for reporting self-injury were introduced in prisons in England and Wales, therefore much of the increase in reported self-harm in 2003 may result from the change in reporting procedures rather than reflect an actual increase in incidence of self-harm<P>

(6) To 16 September 2003 only.<P>

<P>

Reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths and instances of self-harm in prison establishments is a priority for Ministers and for the Prison Services of both England and Wales and Northern Ireland.<P>

<a name="40203w01_para5"></a>A proactive three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm in prisons in England and Wales began in April 2001. The programme has included the training and appointment of suicide prevention co-ordinators in the majority of prisons, the increased provision of prisoner peer support through schemes such as "Insiders" and Samaritan-led "Listeners", an investment of &#163;21 million in six "Safer Local" prisons (Feltham, Leeds, Wandsworth, Winchester, Eastwood Park and Birmingham), and projects to develop safer prison design, including safer cells.
<P>

<a name="40203w01_para6"></a>Over recent months a wide-ranging review of this programme has taken place in consultation with partner agencies such as the Youth Justice Board and outside organisations such as Samaritans and the Howard League, taking into account the evaluations of pilot projects and emerging research findings. This review will inform future suicide prevention strategy beyond April 2004.
<P>

<a name="40203w01_para7"></a>A number of intervention strategies have also been introduced into establishments for people who self-harm. These include counselling, support groups, and specialised psychological interventions. A network of establishments has been set up to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice, and guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has been circulated to establishments.
<P>

<a name="40203w01_para8"></a>In Northern Ireland, a review of policy and practices for dealing with prisoners at risk has recently been completed. This takes a holistic approach to providing the necessary support and care to prevent the individual harming him or herself. It includes an initial assessment on reception to prison, Samaritan services, Listener schemes, an anti-bullying policy and improved structures, systems and procedures. This policy is due to be implemented by the end of April 2004.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203w02_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Baker of Dorking </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How the needs of disabled people will be addressed through the reform of the planning system.[HL892]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   The reforms of the planning system seek to address the issues of access and inclusion throughout the entire planning process.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para0"></a>Clause 38 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill puts a duty on those responsible for preparing development plans to address the issue of sustainable development. This will be defined in planning policy statement 1 (PPS1), which will make it crystal clear that development plans should contain clear and comprehensive inclusive access policies.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para1"></a>Local authorities must seek to involve the whole community in the preparation, alteration and review of all local development documents and significant development control decisions. PPGs 11 and 12 also make clear the importance of access to documents and processes. This includes not only the accessibility of material in terms of clarity, but also in terms of different formats, and&#151;in the case of examinations-in-public&#151;in terms of access both by public transport and to the venue itself.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para2"></a>The draft regulations to be made under Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill make clear that, among others, regional planning bodies and local planning authorities will be required to consult formally with bodies representing disabled people.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para3"></a>The Bill also contains measures to enable planning aid to become more proactive and develop a greater role in targeting communities which traditionally do not get involved in the planning system&#151;including disabled people and disability groups.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para4"></a>Clause 42 of the Bill introduces new powers to introduce a standard application form. Depending on the views of stakeholders we would expect that a document which demonstrates how the project will meet certain provisions of legislation and related codes of practice to ensure that the needs of the disabled are addressed could be required to accompany the form in appropriate cases.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para5"></a>Those applying for planning permission would therefore be required to demonstrate how their proposals contribute to an inclusive environment, and local planning authorities would have to consider this alongside other requirements.

<P>

<a name="40203w02_para6"></a>The current review of the operation of outline planning permission will address the provision of additional information, and while this would need to cover the key design principles, it would also be expected to address access issues.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para7"></a>Outside the Bill the programme of culture change is examining issues such as the diversity of the planning profession, and the issues addressed in education and training.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203w02_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Baker of Dorking  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether their definition of sustainable development for the purposes of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill incorporates provision for social inclusion.[HL893]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40203w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker:  </B>  The Government have four objectives for sustainable development in planning that will be set out in the forthcoming consultation draft of PPS 1. They are sustainable economic development; social inclusion; protection of the environment; and prudent use of resources.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para8"></a>Planning authorities should consider how their plans are addressing the four objectives for sustainable development. They should seek to achieve outcomes which enable economic, social and environmental objectives to be achieved together over time.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para9"></a>In relation to the social inclusion objective of sustainable development, planning policies should promote development that builds social inclusive communities, including suitable mixes of housing.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para10"></a>Policies should ensure that the impact of development on the social fabric of communities is considered and taken into account. Planning policies should address accessibility for all to jobs, health, education, shops, leisure and community facilities.
<P>

<a name="40203w02_para11"></a>Planning policies should take into account the needs of young people and children and the elderly, as well as disabled people, black and minority ethnic groups, and other disadvantaged groups.

In 2003, 32 of the top FTSE 100 companies had no female directors, there were seven finance directors and 39 female directorships were held by non UK citizens. In 2003, the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry commissioned Derek Higgs to report on how the quality, independence, and effectiveness of non-executive directors might be strengthened. Following the recommendations of this review the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry asked Dean Tyson from the London Business School to examine how companies might recruit directors from more diverse backgrounds in order to improve board effectiveness. Both these reports made a number of proposals which boards must consider how to apply in practice.<P>

<a name="40203w02_para21"></a>The Tyson report also made recommendations about director training and the measurement of board diversity. These are being pursued by government and business organisations.

However, the Cabinet Office is keen to encourage departments to undertake periodic audits of the reasons why people resign from boards, or do not seek reappointment. The Cabinet Office, together with departments and the Commissioner for Public Appointments, will be developing guidance to enable departments to monitor any emerging trends and take action.

<A NAME="40203w03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton:  </B>  Individual departments and their public bodies are responsible for providing training and support for individuals appointed to serve on those bodies. They may also offer opportunities for shadowing to those who wish to apply for appointments and would like to gain an insight into the work of public bodies.
<P>

<a name="40203w03_para0"></a>The Cabinet Office is working with departments to develop more opportunities for shadowing and mentoring to encourage and support individuals who are interested in applying for appointments. It is also working to identify best practice in induction and support for those already serving on public bodies, and will issue this to departments when this work is completed.

The Judicial Studies Board, which is an independent body responsible for judicial training, will draw this judgment to judges' attention.
