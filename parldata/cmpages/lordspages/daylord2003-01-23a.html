"(2B) No notice under subsection (2) or (2A) shall be served in respect of any pay reference period more than six years before that date of the service of the notice.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-01_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I must confess that I am not surprised to find myself having to take up the time of the House by bringing back this extraordinarily simple, wholly constructive, non-political and uncontroversial amendment. As your Lordships know, the Government have adopted a totally Pavlovian, rejectionist attitude to any amendment that I may propose. In the almost six years since that disastrous day when I moved from that side of the Dispatch Box to this, there has never, to the best of my recollection, been an occasion when the Government readily conceded that I had a valid point. That is not to say that I have not won amendments; nor is it to say that they have not finally conceded&#151;at the tenth minute of the ninth hour, if you know what I mean. But the truth is that it has never been easy. The concession was never given quickly or smilingly. I am not saying that it is down to the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury. I am very hopeful that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, filling in for the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, will show a different attitude from today onwards.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para4"></a>When all else has failed and no logical argument could possibly be mustered, Ministers have always fallen back on the line that, "This amendment is not necessary". The National Minimum Wage (Enforcement Notices) Bill, an amending Bill, is necessary because of the way in which the original legislation has been interpreted in practice. As noble Lords will know, a tribunal decided that an employee who left his employment could not retrospectively gain his lost minimum wage. The Bill, and the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 itself, commit the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Officer acting for the purposes of the Act",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-01_para5"></a>
to make a retrospective order in relation to any underpayment of the national minimum wage for an unlimited period of time. That is not a fanciful interpretation of the legislation. It is the plain wording of the 1998 Act, which does not place any limitation on how far back the order can go.
<P>


<a name="column_840"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para6"></a>Noble Lords who have sat through these debates will recall that, on Second Reading, I said that I would table an amendment to this effect because the retrospection allowed in relation to notices seemed unlimited. However, the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, said, "No, the notice can go back only three years, so you needn't worry", but I knew that he was wrong. Subsequently, after our debate on Second Reading, he wrote to me and said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no limit in the legislation on how far back enforcement notices may be taken".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-01_para7"></a>
That could not be clearer. However, when we discussed this amendment in Committee and I thought that the Government would immediately accept it, what was the Minister's argument? As usual, he began by saying:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in practice, we believe that the amendment is not needed".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-01_para8"></a>
He went on to claim that the fact that employers are required to hold records for only three years would mean that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Revenue would find it difficult to pursue cases that went back further than three years".&#151;[Official Report, 9/1/03; cols. 1103-04.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-01_para9"></a>
It may be difficult, but it is not impossible.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para10"></a>The Minister himself readily accepted my argument that there are means of proving underpayment other than the employer's records; for example, with payslips kept by the employee himself. He admitted to the Committee that two routes were open to the employee and the enforcement officer in respect of any alleged underpayment. The first is the ordinary civil courts, where any claim would be subject to the provisions of the Limitation Act 1980. The Minister told the Committee that he agreed that that legislation would apply. That limitation restricts claims for any simple civil debt to a period of just six years.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para11"></a>However, as the Minister admitted in his letter to me, and as he admitted to the Committee, under the tribunal procedure, claims could go back much longer. He said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it seems likely that few cases . . .  will go back further than six years".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-01_para12"></a>
A few cases? One case would be too many.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para13"></a>There is an unacceptable anomaly. It would be so easy just to accept it and allow the two procedures to operate side by side. Parliament should not, however, be creating a two-tier system of justice whereby people can get more in one court than in another.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para14"></a>I am sure that the Minister's obstinate refusal to accept my amendment, the principle of which he told your Lordships he agreed with, is due to a total misunderstanding of what it actually says. I say that with all due respect to the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, especially because he is not here. In Committee, he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I . . .  think it would be wrong to create a position in which officers using the tribunals route could not go back as far as the workers themselves could".&#151;[Official Report, 9/1/03; cols. 1103-04.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-01_para15"></a>
The amendment provides for absolute parity between the two routes. That is why I say that he must have misunderstood the amendment&#151;which provides six years' retrospection regardless of the forum, court or tribunal, that the employee chooses.
<P>


<a name="column_841"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 841</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para16"></a>There is currently a discrepancy whereby an applicant to a tribunal can in theory present a grievance dating back 10 or 20 years. In a court, however, the applicant would be bound by the statute of limitations which allows only six years. The situation is a nonsense. I am sure that, this time, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, will agree. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, clearly feels aggrieved that as regards minimum wage and employment legislation it is very difficult for her to persuade the Government to accept her amendment. She seems to believe that some prejudice is held by the Government against her and that if someone else produced the amendment perhaps it would be accepted by them. I cannot speak for the Minister who, as we know, can speak most ably for himself.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para17"></a>On this occasion, as on so many others, we will not be supporting the noble Baroness, not because we have any prejudice against her&#151;indeed, how could one possibly have that?&#151;but simply because on this, as on many other matters, we disagree with her.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para18"></a>First, I am not sure that it is a sound thesis on which she bases the amendment. Why should an individual holding a number of payslips, and who has become aware for the first time that he or she has been underpaid, be artificially restricted in the remedies available to him or her? Why should they be so restricted?
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para19"></a>Secondly, as a former lawyer I am always extremely dubious of legislation attempting arbitrarily to interfere with limitation periods. I do not wish to anticipate what the Minister has to say, but I believe that the Bill should remain as drafted on this point and that it should not artificially attempt to interfere with the limitation period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Blackwell: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say how the time period relates to claiming back payment for benefits? Obviously, a number of recipients of the national minimum wage may well be recipients of benefits or be entitled to benefits. I wonder what is the Government's obligation as regards people claiming past benefits and how that would appear in relation to parity with their ability to claim on employers.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_time0"></a><H5>11.15 a.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I remind the House of what the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, said in Committee about the practical effects of this amendment. He explained that there are two ways of pursuing a failure to comply with an enforcement notice. He said that the first is to pursue it through the county courts, but in such cases the Limitation Act 1980 already applies. It is only possible to recover arrears for a period of up to six years from the date of each underpayment.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para20"></a>Almost all cases brought by the Revenue have used that route and they are already subject to a six-year restriction. It is possible to proceed through the <P>


<a name="column_842"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 842</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employment tribunals. It does not happen very often because the claim has to be made within three months, which is a difficult limitation. It means in practical terms that that route has hardly ever been used by the Revenue. The vast majority of cases can only refer back six years before the date on which proceedings are brought. Although in theory some cases could be taken further back, in practice that is extremely unlikely. I remind the House that the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, pointed out that employers are required only to keep wage records for three years. Therefore, if records are to be kept for a greater period, which is relevant to the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, the employer would have to keep records going back further.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para21"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, is right. There is a difference between very rarely and never. We have thought about the matter again. We believe that it would be right in practice to provide for something similar to what the noble Baroness wants. It cannot be the amendment before us because it has technical problems, but it will be one which says roughly what the noble Baroness wants. We hope to have it drafted in time for Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="30123-01_para22"></a>I am sorry that that proposal disappoints the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. You cannot win them all. The very purity, if I may put it that way, of the argument put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that even if it hardly ever happens&#151;and it could not for a number of years because the national minimum wage relates only as far back as April 1999&#151;ultimately tips the balance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, this really is a success! I began by saying that perhaps the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, would find a way around the problem. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, is on the wrong side again, but what can I do about that? We shall look very carefully at what the Government bring forward at Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para1"></a>Clause 2 [Short title, commencement and extent]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 18, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-02_para2"></a><P>

<a name="30123-02_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am speechless, really. As noble Lords know, the first amendment was designed to stop employers having to deal with someone who wants to refer to a matter which goes back over a long period.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para4"></a>This second amendment is very much for the benefit of the employee. I am totally even-handed on this side of the House. This amendment is intended to remove from the Bill the provision that postpones the operation of the Act until two months after it is passed. When I proposed this amendment in Committee the Minister argued that he accepted that it was intended to be helpful. The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, said that he had the greatest sympathy with <P>


<a name="column_843"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 843</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>me for wanting to ensure that the employee was entitled to receive his money immediately and not have to wait two months. But the noble Lord had checked with the Cabinet Office, which said it was the custom that the provision did not apply until after two months. Therefore, as a man of custom&#151;he told me this outside the Chamber but indicated more or less the same inside the Chamber&#151;he did not want to change the custom if it was not necessary to do so. What he actually said in the Chamber was that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Bills commence two months after Royal Assent, unless there are pressing reasons for bringing the Bill into force more rapidly".&#151;[Official Report, 9/1/03; Col. 1105.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-02_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30123-02_para6"></a>At that time I described the amendment as "probing". I wanted to see what possible explanation there could be for making an employee wait two months. When I argued the case in Committee&#151;strongly&#151;I made the point that in any event there was a mistake in the original drafting and therefore it ought to be rectified and enacted immediately.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para7"></a>I took it upon myself to check this matter in the Library. Francis Bennion, in his Statutory Interpretation (4th edition, 2002)&#151;it is therefore up to date&#151;said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The commencement date may be the date of passing of the Act, or a date specified or indicated in the Act, or a date specified in a commencement order made by a Minister or other functionary".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-02_para8"></a>
So, although the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, said that it was the custom, that interpretation says something a little different. It says that it could be the date of the passing of the Act; it could be a date specified or indicated in the Act; or it could be a date specified in the commencement order.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para9"></a>Interestingly enough, an investigation carried out in 1979 by a Statute Law Society working party looked at 105 public general Acts passed between 1st January 1978 and April 1979&#151;a period of 14 months&#151;to ascertain when Acts usually come into force. They found that 41 Acts came into effect on the exact date of the passing of the Act; 12 Acts came into force on a date specified in the Act; and 14 Acts came into force on the expiry of a period of one, two or three months after passing. I understand that the Minister may say that that investigation was carried out in 1978 and 1979 and that the custom now is that Acts commence two months after Royal Assent, as he said in Committee, but I asked the Library to check a little further.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, made the point in regard to my first amendment that employees should be able to claim their entitlement and to have it backdated, however far. Equally, I am sure that he would not want employees to have to wait for their money if it is not necessary.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para11"></a>The Education Act 2002 was enacted immediately; the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act was enacted immediately; the Armed Forces Act immediately; and the Freedom of Information Act immediately. Those Acts were enacted in 2000&#150;01. The Access to Justice Act was enacted immediately, as was the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998. The Minister may say that there were pressing reasons for those Acts to be enacted immediately and that we can <P>


<a name="column_844"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 844</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>forget custom in those circumstances, but I believe that an employee who is underpaid and wants to claim his money back now should be able to do so. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, I do not always disagree with the noble Baroness. On this occasion I agree with her.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, again, we cannot all win. Of course the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, is right. It is possible for an Act to come into force on Royal Assent&#151;and that often happens&#151;but the established procedure is that unless there are vital reasons for bringing a Bill into force more rapidly, we give those concerned with the Bill&#151;in this case it is both business and employees&#151;a reasonable opportunity to see and understand the implications of a new Act before it comes into force. That is the only reason for delaying it for two months.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para12"></a>However, there is another reason for not worrying about this Bill being brought into force two months later&#151;and that is that it allows enforcement officers to issue notices in respect of pay periods ending before it comes into force. There is therefore no disadvantage whatever in that two-month delay. Past money owed to workers can be recovered whether the Bill comes into force, say, in March or May of this year. Under those circumstances, and in light of the fact that it is true that this is a conservative kind of argument&#151;the Cabinet Office advised us that this was the right thing to do and we have to go back to the Attorney-General and Legislative Programme Committee to effect a change&#151;and particularly in view of the fact that nobody loses by this delay, I hope that the noble Baroness will not press her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, after such a kind explanation, how could I be so ungracious? As long as I have the Minister's absolute reassurance that the delay will not interfere with an employee's rights&#151; I am sure that is correct&#151;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

That does not necessarily apply to benefits. However, I shall write to the noble Lord on that issue.
<P>


<a name="column_845"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 845</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para16"></a>Amendment No. 3 is a technical amendment dealing with devolved powers which have been requested&#151;too late for the Committee stage&#151;by the Scottish Executive in order to exempt agriculture in Scotland from the provisions of the Bill. Employment is a reserved matter while agriculture is devolved for Scotland and Northern Ireland. In addition, the agricultural minimum wage has been in place throughout the United Kingdom for more than 50 years.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para17"></a>The way the present legislation works is that Schedule 2 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 made a number of amendments to the Agricultural Wages Act (Scotland) 1949, to incorporate some of the provisions of the national minimum wage into the agricultural minimum wage. It is clear that the operation of the agricultural minimum wage in Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Executive.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para18"></a>It had two options. The first was to propose a Sewel Motion, which would have allowed Westminster to legislate on this matter even though it is devolved. Before Christmas the Scottish Office informed us on behalf of the Executive that that is what it planned to do. That is why, when we presented the Bill to the House, we covered the agricultural minimum wage in Scotland as well as the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para19"></a>However, the Executive has now decided that it does not wish to propose a Sewel Motion and intends to lay parallel independent legislation covering Scottish agriculture in the Edinburgh Parliament. It has asked us to amend our Bill to exclude Scottish agriculture from its scope.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para20"></a>It is not a pretty amendment. I do not claim it is. Anything which has to rely on disregarding matters in the Interpretation Act will never be beautiful. But, in simple terms, it ensures that the provisions in the Bill will not be carried across into the Agricultural Wages Act (Scotland) 1949. It does not affect the existing structure of the national minimum wage or agricultural wages legislation. All it means is that the Scottish Executive will need to introduce parallel legislation to tackle the difficulties we have encountered and to carry across the provisions of this Bill into Scottish agriculture.
<P>

<a name="30123-02_para21"></a>The situation is the same in Northern Ireland. But while the Stormont Assembly is temporarily suspended, the Department of Trade and Industry has confirmed with the Northern Ireland Office that it is content for the Bill to cover agriculture in Northern Ireland. I beg to move.

We note the assurance in the letter, and in what he has now said to the House, that the Scottish Parliament will pass independent parallel legislation.

<P>
<A NAME="30123-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the Minister will inform the House what the agricultural minimum wage is in Scotland. My impression is that it is a good deal higher.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, it would be useful to have some clarification on the record, if not today perhaps in correspondence, about exactly where the line is drawn between the degree of devolvement and the compatibility with the original legislation, so that there is no difference. Intuitively, the answer is reasonably clear, but it would be useful to have some clarification on the record.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I shall deal first with the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. No, I cannot give an assurance that the legislation will be identical. That is a matter for the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament. If they want to do it in a different way, or even if they want to do something different, that is their privilege. That is the meaning of devolution.
<P>

<a name="30123-03_para0"></a>I do not know the answer to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, as to whether agricultural minimum wages are higher. I am not sure that I should apologise for that, as it is a devolved matter on which I am not supposed to be informed, let alone responsible.
<P>

<a name="30123-03_para1"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Lea that there should be the utmost clarity in what matters are covered, reserved and devolved. I do not believe that there is any lack of clarity. I think that the Scotland Act provision that employment matters be reserved and agriculture be devolved, combined with the provision for either separate legislation or a Sewell resolution, covers any conceivable confusion, but if I am wrong I shall write to my noble friend on that point.

<a name="30123-03_para7"></a>I shall begin briefly by outlining my overall objection to this dishonourable Bill, an objection that colours my attitude to each and every element that we will consider today.
<P>

<a name="30123-03_para8"></a>The Bill is devised in a form that is intended to hand over undue influence, if not control, to an element in our society that has sought to undermine the <P>


<a name="column_847"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 847</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland. That is Sinn Fein/IRA, to which new Labour and the Prime Minister felt obliged to capitulate at Weston Park, at the same time as they pretended to give consideration to the overall interests of society in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30123-03_para9"></a>Ordinary society in Northern Ireland feels that all the comprise that it made to accommodate everyone in the political process is worthless. It feels that promises made publicly again and again by the Prime Minister are worthless. Also, it feels that when we get to the stage of relegating the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to bit-player, as the clause does, that makes policing and the rule of law a charade.
<P>

<a name="30123-03_para10"></a>Lessons have not been learned from the lack of substantive contributions made by Sinn Fein/IRA to the Mitchell principles. Have we by any chance forgotten the Mitchell principles? I have to ask the Minister what has changed or is about to change. Will he tell the House whether, and if so when, we will reach that defining moment when the paramilitary Sinn Fein/IRA disarms and disbands? If I have a satisfactory answer to that question, I and others may be able to view the Bill in a different light from that in which I presently do.
<P>

<a name="30123-03_para11"></a>For those who may presume to tell me that Sinn Fein/IRA is not the only paramilitary grouping in Northern Ireland, I simply say that I am hardly unaware of that. However, the Bill is not intended to create inequitable privileges for loyalists, and neither am I. The Bill is intended to create inequitable privileges for Sinn Fein/IRA and it alone.
<P>

<a name="30123-03_para12"></a>Did the Minister really mean what he said to me at Second Reading when we mentioned what would happen in comparable circumstances in Surrey? He drew attention to the fact that I had asked why criminals should be allowed on DPPs when they would not in Surrey. He told me:

<a name="30123-03_para14"></a>In other words, there is not the pressure on policing anywhere else in the United Kingdom that necessitates, as in the clause, the relegation of the professional side of policing to something right at the bottom of the pile. I have been in this Parliament for 20 years. I know the value of the democratic process and I subscribe to it, but I also know that it will suffer if we relegate those responsible&#151;the guardians of law and order, the enforcers of the law&#151;to the bottom of the pile. That is why I suggest that we leave out subsections (1) and (2). I beg to move.

<a name="30123-03_para15"></a>The noble Lord said that the clause relegated the Chief Constable to the role of bit-player. That is an absurdity, if I may say so. The noble Lord knows that I am not criticising him personally, because we have the best of personal relationships, but it is simply not an accurate reflection of what the clause does. He says that the forces of law and order are being put at the bottom of the pile, which is simply not realistic.
<P>

<a name="30123-03_para16"></a>I will repeat briefly what I said at length in Committee about what the clause does. It reflects a small but important change in the balance of the relationship over policing between the Secretary of State and the Policing Board. The clause does not give the board a veto over the Secretary of State's objectives. We may need to return to that point on Amendments Nos. 3 and 6. It requires the Secretary of State to try to ensure that he and the board work collectively and harmoniously to develop policing objectives.
<P>

<a name="30123-03_para17"></a>We think it right to make those changes to Sections 24 and 27 of the 2000 Act. The Patten report was particularly critical of the previous arrangements. The simple, single effect of Amendments Nos. 1 and 4, in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Maginnis and Lord Rogan, would be to maintain the status quo. For the reasons I have set out, that would be inappropriate. I am not in a position to, nor do I wish to, accept the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, there can be no doubt that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, and I are opposed on this issue. None the less, it is not an appropriate time to discuss the matter. I do not promise that we shall not return to it at Third Reading, but, for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw.

<a name="30123-03_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 2 and 5, which are grouped, would ensure that the Secretary of State would consult with the Chief Constable,

<P>

<a name="30123-03_para22"></a>It is appropriate that a working partnership be consolidated between the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State in addition to that between the board and the Secretary of State. These amendments would put consultation with the Chief Constable on an equal footing with consultation with the board. Two different relationships in this triangle must be developed. My amendment tries to balance them in a way that is probably correct.

<FONT SIZE=3>proposal. The noble and learned Lord also stated that the police Bill had a different shade of nuance from the police Act 2000. What has changed since the 2000 Act was passed? What are the practical implications of such a change? What is the difference between consulting and consulting,

<a name="30123-03_para25"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, for sharing his interpretation of "long-term objectives". He said that they have more to do with political issues than operational ones, and that the Chief Constable then interprets such objectives in an operational manner. Although it is Northern Ireland we are discussing, that seems a little bogus. There is something wrong in that approach. I shall be interested to hear the interpretation of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal of "long-term objectives", which I understand to be the justification for the amendments to the police Act 2000, in Clause 1.
<P>

<a name="30123-03_para26"></a>My key points are that the balance of relationships should be maintained, bearing in mind that for "Secretary of State" we could, I hope, soon be reading "First Minister and Deputy First Minister". There must be a balance in the relationships between the board, which is quasi-political, the Secretary of State, who is obviously political, and the Chief Constable, the operational person responsible for the security, safety and policing of the Province. A consensus on the long-term objectives should be reached between the three different groups. My amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State would consult the Chief Constable,

<A NAME="30123-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, underpins, perhaps in less trenchant terms, exactly what I said earlier. His amendment gives the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal an opportunity at least to concede a provision that simply intimates that consultation with the Chief Constable will be given the same consideration as consultation with the board. It would alleviate my problem of the Chief Constable's relegation to a position of secondary importance in the consultation process. The qualification proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, would help to alleviate our difficulty.

Unless, agreement is reached between the three parties&#151;the Secretary of State, the board and the Chief Constable&#151;their relationship will be difficult. It is, after all, the Chief Constable who will have to work out the strategy to meet these objectives. I am sure that the last thing the noble and learned Lord wants is difficult relationships in this area of activity.

could be disagreed with. Amendment No. 2 does not say that the Secretary of State must obtain the Chief Constable's agreement. He must consult only,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-04_para2"></a>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. I wish to inject a long-term view. So far, the Policing Board is working very well. It seems to be learning and working as an admirable institution. But the political long-term intention is that Sinn Fein should also join the Policing Board. That would change the chemistry of the board, because Sinn Fein's views on policing are totally different from everyone else's. I will raise only one of the obvious problems with that. The Chief Constable will have to operate within the arrangements decided, and it will be more important than ever that his relationship with the Secretary of State should be as strong as possible. Otherwise, the arrangements will not work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-04_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment. I declare an interest as a member of the Policing Board. However, I stress that my remarks, unless I say otherwise, are as an individual on the board.
<P>

<a name="30123-04_para3"></a>I support the amendment because "consult" means very different things to different types and groups of people. All too often, when politicians talk about consulting, they mean dictating. In certain debates and dealings with the Government, at least in this Chamber, many believe that when they say they have explored every avenue of consultation and talked to everybody, they mean that they have informed people.
<P>

<a name="30123-04_para4"></a>The Secretary of State is a political figure, therefore there is no handicap in including the word "agreement". The Government cannot simply circulate a sheet of paper or inform bodies verbally of a decision and then say that they have consulted. A two-way process is needed. On that basis, I cannot see what danger would be imposed on the Government by stressing that negotiations, the passing of information and consulting are part of a two-way process, not a diktat.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, for so carefully explaining the amendments. I remind your Lordships of the present position.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-04_para10"></a>
That is the present requirement. If the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, is troubled about what consultation means, that is the present legal situation.
<P>

<a name="30123-04_para11"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Maginnis and Lord Glentoran, asked about the nature of a long-term objective. Paragraph 6.16 of the Patten report refers to objectives in terms of a three to five-year span.
<P>

<a name="30123-04_para12"></a>I sympathise with the thrust of the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. I should like to explain, briefly, how I see the distinction. I said on a number of occasions in Grand Committee and again today that the clause is designed to allow for a slight adjustment&#151;the different nuance I mentioned&#151;which the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, cited to me. It is a slight adjustment of power towards the board. The critical point is this. There is a distinction in this tripartite policing relationship between the role of the Chief Constable on the one hand and the board and the Secretary of State on the other. The latter have the responsibility for setting the strategic direction of policing in Northern Ireland. That is their broad purpose.
<P>

<a name="30123-04_para13"></a>The duty of the Chief Constable is importantly, even if only subtly, different. That duty is the operational management of the police. His duty and obligation is to implement the objectives set by the board and the Secretary of State. That is a qualitatively different job. I am happy to say as firmly as I can that it is not the intention of the Government that policing objectives should be foisted on the Chief Constable with no regard to his wishes or views. I was glad to hear the endorsement of the noble Baroness, Lady Park, that the board is settling well and working well with a very new Chief Constable. That is a common view.
<P>

<a name="30123-04_para14"></a>The purpose of the consultation is to listen to the views of the Chief Constable, have regard to them and pay careful attention to them. But there are the distinctions to which I pointed. Whether your Lordships agree with that description of difference is a matter for your Lordships. In my mind, it is a different quality of purpose and role and that is why we have this slight readjustment. I do not pretend that it is not intended to be a readjustment. I have said so on many occasions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for that response. There is still some difference between us. I have a certain amount of sympathy with his explanation of the role of the police board and the Secretary of State in setting long-term objectives together, as allowed for in the legislation. I also accept that it is the role of the Chief Constable to devolve the strategy and operational plans for carrying out this long-term strategy. Looking ahead four or five years or even longer, what a difference there may be in personalities such as the First Minister, Deputy First <P>

It is more by way of a probing amendment to seek an assurance from the noble and learned Lord. This Bill is designed to accommodate Sinn Fein/IRA on the Policing Board and on district policing partnerships. That is the primary objective of the Bill, based on what happened at Weston Park.
<P>

<a name="30123-04_para18"></a>I have experienced the mercurial nature of Sinn Fein. Last year, on my own district council, we had a Sinn Fein chairman. He was an excellent chairman. Everything went absolutely tickety-boo, as he would say, in terms of council business. This year, we have an SDLP chairman. The former chairman now sits down the chamber. I have seen him rise with a fistful of papers to fling them in the face of the SDLP chairman. That is the mercurial nature of Sinn Fein. If this Bill goes through, that could be the behaviour of Sinn Fein on the board and on partnerships.
<P>

<a name="30123-04_para19"></a>The Secretary of State has to consult with a view to obtaining agreement to the proposed objectives or revision in terms of codes of practice. If that is not possible, how do we ensure that the business of policing and the respective roles of the Secretary of State and Chief Constable are not hindered to the detriment of society? I believe that by adding our Amendments Nos. 3 and 6 there would be enshrined in legislation a means whereby we could overcome this difficulty. I shall listen with interest to what the noble and learned Lord has to say on this matter. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30123-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I shall respond in the same spirit as the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis. I will be able to reassure the noble Lord. The approach encapsulated in the clause is that it is for the Secretary of State to consult the board with a view to obtaining its agreement. I am quite sure that the Secretary of State and his successors will make every effort to do so. However, I think the nub of the noble Lord's question was about what would happen if there was a disagreement. I can give an assurance; the situation is quite plain. In the unlikely event that no agreement is arrived at, the Secretary of State's powers remain intact. In other words, the board has no veto.

<a name="30123-05_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 stipulated that the board meet 10 times a year. The Bill reduces that to eight times a year. The reduction in the number of public meetings of the board each year is a departure from Patten.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para7"></a>In Committee, the Minister explained that those changes had been made at the specific request of the Policing Board, as it wanted greater flexibility over when it could hold meetings. However, that flexibility can be achieved under subsection (2), which removes the time limit on the holding of public meetings. The 2000 Act already compromised Patten on that point by reducing the minimum number of meetings from 12 to 10. To reduce it further&#151;to eight&#151;would be a retrograde step for transparency and public accountability. Flexibility is not a good enough reason for the change. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I understand the noble Lord's concern, but all that we are doing here is setting a different minimum. It is important to recognise that that is all that is proposed. I return to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth: the board is settling in well and learning through experience. The board specifically asked us to put the minimum at eight.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para8"></a>As it happens, the public meetings are not well attended. I cannot think why. The board needs to have many private meetings, for obvious reasons that we all understand. Occasionally, with the pressure of private meeting business and the squalls that sometimes come up over Christmas or other holiday periods, the board finds it logistically difficult to comply with the statutory minimum.

<P>
<A NAME="30123-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that explanation. I do not entirely accept that reasons of logistics and so on should prevent the board holding a minimum of public meetings a year.

<a name="30123-05_para16"></a>The clause will reduce the grounds on which the Chief Constable can refer a request for information to the Secretary of State. That is a particularly important matter in Northern Ireland where the maintenance of the operational independence of the chief officer of police is such a sensitive issue. Under the 2000 Act, the Chief Constable is not allowed a veto over the board on whether a report on a matter specified by the board should be made. The amendments to be made to that Act by the Bill will be damaging.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para17"></a>I fear that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal will say that he does not foresee a situation in which our fears would be relevant. I cannot agree. Friendly as we are most of the time, we disagreed about that in Committee, and I am concerned that we may fall out again today. Forcing a Chief Constable to report to a board in a way that was likely to prejudice the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders must be wrong in any part of the kingdom.

<a name="30123-05_para18"></a>In Committee, I asked the noble and learned Lord why the Government felt it necessary to make such an extraordinary change and what had changed so dramatically in Northern Ireland between 2000 and January 2003. I was not satisfied with his explanations then. He may be able to help me today, but I am not optimistic. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30123-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   My Lords, nowadays, in serious fraud cases, the courts make provision to lighten the load of a jury by laying on electronic recall of complicated documents and projecting the results onto screens all around the court. That makes it easier for the jury to follow what is said to them, however complex. I wish that something of the same could have been made available while we discussed this amendment. It would make it easier for people who have not been initiated&#151;"blooded" might be another word&#151;by a discussion of at least an hour in Grand Committee to follow the way in which the Bill changes an important part of the law. Its importance was conceded by the noble and learned Lord in Grand Committee when he dealt with the grounds for the amendment with his customary care and accuracy. Because I have kept quiet so far this morning, perhaps I might be indulged in explaining what is done at a little length.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para19"></a>The matter can be put simply&#151;it has to be without the kind of aid to the drafting changes that are involved&#151;but nonetheless accurately. The context is the duty of the Chief Constable, as explained by my noble friend Lord Glentoran, to submit to the policing board reports whenever he is required by the board to do so. What kind of reports?&#151;reports on any matter that the board may specify in its requirement. How soon must he comply?&#151;within one month of any such requirement or&#151;the noble and learned Lord placed great emphasis on this in his reply to me&#151;any such longer period as may be agreed by the Chief Constable with the board. We will return to the significance of that provision.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para20"></a>I referred to the present law. How old is it? It is not as much as three years old. It comes from Section 59 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. It may even be less than two years old, because Section 59 did not come into force on the passing of the Act but on some later date ordered by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that I have not been able to determine.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para21"></a>This being about the policing of Northern Ireland and the history of Northern Ireland&#151;not, as we have been reminded, of Surrey&#151;some safeguards were included against the consequence of tensions between the policing board and the Chief Constable. We all are grateful for the fact that the board seems to be settling down and is working. It is greatly to our advantage that we have among us the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, as a member of that board, which adds enormously to our discussion of these matters.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para22"></a>It was anticipated by Parliament a short time ago that tensions could arise between the Chief Constable and the board. I do not believe that it would be realistic <P>


<a name="column_856"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 856</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to suppose that anticipation is entirely eliminated by the encouraging but early start that has been made. It was anticipated that those tensions could arise in such a way that the Chief Constable would be asked to report on a matter that he thought would be bound to contain information that ought not to be disclosed for one or more of four reasons. They are interests of national security; because the matter relates to an individual and is of a sensitive and personal character; it would or would be likely to prejudice proceedings which have been commenced in a court of law; or the critical reason for our discussion, in Section 59(3)(d) of the 2000 Act, which is that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would, or would be likely, to prejudice the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-05_para23"></a><P>

<a name="30123-05_para24"></a>The character of the safeguards are to be found in the same section. The Chief Constable can refer any such requirement to the Secretary of State, then it will be over to him. He can do what he likes. He can amend the requirement or override it. It is over to him and off the responsibility of the Chief Constable.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para25"></a>I believe that it is still necessary that all such grounds should be open to the Secretary of State. Unfortunately, the Bill removes paragraph (d). The prosecution of offenders, and more especially perhaps the apprehension of crime, fall absolutely fair and square within the operational discretion of the Chief Constable. They are for him and him alone. I leave aside the later stages of prosecution, which of course become the responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para26"></a>I invite the House to agree that it is terribly important that the Chief Constable's operational discretion&#151;the noble and learned Lord confirmed a moment ago that the operational management of the police is for the Chief Constable&#151;should not be trenched apart. If one takes away the ground contained in Section 59(3)(d), one opens the way&#151;it may not be readily foreseen but could be taken&#151;to covert prevention of crime being apprehended in one particular or other and to not being able to prosecute some individual because the trail has been muddied or for some other reason.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para27"></a>We fasten upon that because of its importance. In Grand Committee, the noble and learned Lord said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This is a topic of great seriousness. It may be the most important aspect of our discussions at this stage".&#151;[Official Report, 9/1/03; col. GC68.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-05_para28"></a><P>

<a name="30123-05_para29"></a>When he first put forward the justification for what is being done, the noble and learned Lord drew attention to the point to which I have already alluded&#151;that there can be postponement of the report if that is agreed between the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State. It has to be delivered in one month or such later time as may agreed. One hopes that there would be agreement, but the necessity for the safeguards that I have mentioned has been the anticipation that there may be such tensions between the Chief Constable and the policing board that a reasonable demand is not made or that reasonable agreement is not available. That in itself is not sufficient.
<P>


<a name="column_857"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 857</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para30"></a>The noble and learned Lord relies upon the Patten report and the implementation plan. He had to concede, not surprisingly, that the Patten report came before the 2000 Act, which contains the law that I have explained and which is now sought to be changed. The noble and learned Lord reminded us that the implementation report published in July 2001 stated that the Government intended to remove Section 59(3)(d)&#151;claiming that that had effectively been recommended by Patten. What has changed? If, notwithstanding Patten's recommendation, it was thought necessary to include the safeguard in paragraph (d) in the 2000 Act, why by 2001 was it thought necessary to remove it? Who asked for that to be done?
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para31"></a>Even if the Government gave notice of their intention in the implementation plan of July 2001, surely there is some ground for reviewing that decision or at least for explaining the rationale. One should not regard the implementation plan in the way that the German general staff regarded the mobilisation plan in 1914&#151;"Because it's in the plan, it can't be changed. The trains are moving and that's that". From time to time, there is just a little room for a slight accretion of wisdom as the years roll by&#151;for example, after a manifesto has been published. We should not be bound hand and foot to the plan's implementation or otherwise.
<P>

<a name="30123-05_para32"></a>Therefore I respectfully agree with the noble and learned Lord when he says that this is probably the most important feature of the Bill and a matter of great seriousness. Of course we agree that the necessity for relying on the safeguard is unlikely and we all pray that it will never arise. But it might. What is the justification for removing something which Parliament, in its wisdom, thought it necessary to include as recently as three years ago?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, it might be helpful to the House if the noble and learned Lord could tell us how often Section 59 reports have been called for by the board; and how often the Chief Constable has felt obliged to rely on the safeguards at present built into subsection (3)?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I return to my usual premise. Both the implementation plan and the Patten recommendations rested on the idea that Sinn Fein would support the new police arrangements, would join the board and would work with everyone. Sinn Fein has given clear indications that it wishes to destroy the present police; it has told its own young people not to join. That is not what was planned. In view of that, it is vital that the wise provisions of the 2000 Act are retained and we ensure that it is not possible for anyone who wishes to be a wrecker to wreck.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I want to enlarge on a very sensible query posed by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, in terms of how many times the necessity has arisen for the Chief Constable to invoke <P>


<a name="column_858"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 858</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 8. In terms of this Bill, that is not relevant. We are looking at a situation where Sinn Fein is going to be given a leg up on to the Policing Board and where an entirely different set of circumstances will rule.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para0"></a>If the safeguard is removed and if at the same time the number of people on the Policing Board who are able either to demand a report from the Chief Constable or to seek an inquiry is reduced, we shall have a greater need for the safeguard that is sought today. I simply make that point. We cannot judge on what is happening now, but we must judge on what is likely to happen when Sinn Fein is brought on to the board, as clearly the Government intend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-06_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, I support Amendment No. 10. At the previous stage of the Bill, we asked the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, where the proposal had come from and who had asked for it. He said only that it had appeared in the Patten review and in a few other documents. Clearly, if that had been the sole reason for the proposal, the Government would have followed the Patten review in the first place. They did not do so then and have now introduced it for a different reason.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para1"></a>Who asked for the measure? The noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, hit the nail on the head in saying that it was the SDLP and Sinn Fein. It is no secret within the Policing Board at present that the SDLP wishes to have the ability to inquire into everything. The SDLP is very much part of the working board, but there are one or two small issues that it likes to address from the point of view of its electorate. The SDLP wants to be able say to its electorate that it is part of a body which can investigate anything, anywhere, at any time, regardless of the consequences. Therefore nobody&#151;for even good judicial and crime detection reasons&#151;can intervene or put anything in the SDLP's way.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para2"></a>It has asked for and questioned the first provision,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the interests of national security".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-06_para3"></a>
When the late director of the Security Services appeared at the Policing Board, the question was asked: why should we not look at national security? That suggestion clearly came from the SDLP and Sinn Fein wants that too. They have asked for Clause 8 and the Government are prepared to give way.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para4"></a>Those to whom I have spoken, either in regard to policing or legal issues, have said that this can be only to the detriment of crime detection and prevention because the Chief Constable can refuse on the basis that the matter is already in court. The police may have a case which they have spent months investigating. Noble Lords will understand that cases cannot be investigated and reach court in less than a month, so this length of time is short enough. The Chief Constable can refer the matter to the Secretary of State and once it is under the jurisdiction of the court, it cannot be intervened with. However, before reaching court the whole case can be destroyed.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para5"></a>On speaking to someone who wants the measure, I put forward the point&#151;it does not matter whether we are referring to the Stormont spy case or anything else, but that is a particularly long-running case&#151;that if <P>


<a name="column_859"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 859</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information is required, it should be available. I asked what would happen if obtaining the information prejudiced the case. For all I know, a policeman or a spy at Stormont could be involved in the case. I asked what would happen if ultimately someone should be prosecuted but the case could not go ahead because the information obtained came from areas where the Chief Constable had no protection. I was told, "That that would not happen because we would not ask".
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para6"></a>The clause is nothing but a safety net. It is perfectly straightforward. It is obviously being used to buy Sinn Fein and to allow it and the SDLP to go to their electorate and say that they are on the board. I believe that the SDLP is talking purely to its electorate. Sinn Fein is talking to its electorate. We know what may happen at the next election; people may move to the extremes. The SDLP is being reasonable within the board, but it has backed this proposal because it knows that the Government are ready to sell out. That is totally unreasonable and totally impractical. I believe that it simply would not occur in any other jurisdiction one could imagine as being sane, sensible and working for peace.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, is right. First, he said explicitly that this probably is the issue that concerns your Lordships more than any other in the Bill. Secondly, he said implicitly that we are unlikely to agree. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, helpfully developed the issue&#151;to give it a proper and appropriate hearing&#151;to encompass the whole of the Clause 19 issues. It is probably helpful for me to respond in the same manner because if there is to be a Division it might as well be at this stage rather than when we come to Clause 19. The structure of the Act means that it is impossible to discuss these amendments without the wider issues of Clause 19.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para7"></a>The answer to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, is "none".
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para8"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, is right in saying that the proposal derives from paragraph 6.22 in the Pattern report, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We recommend that the Policing Board should have the power to require the Chief Constable to report on any issue pertaining to the performance of his functions or those of the police service".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-06_para9"></a>
I stress the next sentence.
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The obligation to report should extend to explaining operational decisions. The grounds on which the Chief Constable might question this requirement should be strictly limited to issues such as those involving national security, sensitive personnel matters and cases before the courts".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-06_para10"></a>
That, in fact&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-06_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for giving way. The report refers to the Chief Constable explaining decisions. I accept that that relates to decisions which the Chief Constable has made; decisions that have been taken. But he may be asked for information during an investigation and for the reasons why decisions may be <P>


<a name="column_860"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 860</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>taken in the immediate future. In that respect, we are talking about two different things. Past decisions taken some time ago are different from decisions being taken at a particular moment during the conduct of an investigation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I see the distinction, but I do not accept its validity. The Patten report is unambiguous on the matter:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The obligation to report should extend to explaining operational decisions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-06_para11"></a>
That does not state that the decisions have to belong to pre-history. Indeed, the Patten report puts the almost philosophical difference clearly, if not wholly to the satisfaction of everyone in this Chamber.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para12"></a>The report continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"One of the most difficult issues we have considered is the question of 'operational independence'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-06_para13"></a>
I remember that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, turned to this matter when we had our most illuminating discussion in Grand Committee. The report goes on:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Long consideration has led us to the view that the term 'operational independence' is itself a large part of the problem. In a democratic society, all public officials must be fully accountable to the institutions of that society for the due performance of their functions, and a chief of police cannot be an exception. No public official, including a chief of police, can be said to be 'independent'. Indeed, given the extraordinary powers conferred on the police, it is essential that their exercise is subject to the closest and most effective scrutiny possible".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-06_para14"></a>
That is, perhaps, an almost philosophical difference of approach.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para15"></a>The noble and learned Lord is right in saying that the implementation plan is dated 2001&#151;post the Act. The report further states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Policing Board should have the power, subject only to the same limitation set out in paragraph 6.22, to follow up any report from the Chief Constable by initiating an inquiry into any aspect of the police service or police conduct".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-06_para16"></a>
That is what is now being done in the Bill. We have altered the four grounds and there are now three. They are set out in Clause 19 as:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(a) it is in the interests of national security;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-06_para17"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) the information is sensitive personnel information or information the disclosure of which would be likely to put an individual in danger;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-06_para18"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) the information would, or would be likely to, prejudice proceedings which have been commenced in a court of law".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-06_para19"></a>
Therefore, if there is information the disclosure of which is likely to put an individual in danger, that is&#151;and I use the term generally&#151;protected.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para20"></a>I do not believe that we are going to reach an agreement of minds here, partly because of the difference of fundamental approach. It is wrong to say that this is a Bill to benefit Sinn Fein; that it is a Sinn Fein benefit. In fact, the SDLP made representations during the passage of the first Bill stressing its discontent.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para21"></a>There are the safeguards here. Section 59(2)(b) of the 2000 Act states that the report shall be made,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"within the period of one month from the date on which that requirement is made or within such longer period as may be agreed between the Chief Constable and the Board".

It is useful to look at recent experience; there has been no requirement&#151;which is the answer to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. I am able to tell your Lordships that the current Chief Constable, when the matter has been discussed with him, finds it hard to see a situation arising in which it would be necessary for him to invoke the ground as it now stands in the Act. He would work with the board to reach an accommodation on issues of that nature.
<P>

<a name="30123-06_para23"></a>I have spent a little time on the general theme of Clause 19. These are not amendments that the Government are prepared to accept. Nor will we accept&#151;I must say plainly at this stage&#151;any attack on the Question that Clause 19 shall stand part of the Bill, if that were to be made. I hope that your Lordships do not think that discourteous, but I have to put the matter beyond doubt.

<P>
<A NAME="30123-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   My Lords, before the noble and learned Lord sits down, perhaps I may ask him for an explanation. He has carefully explained what he describes as a difference of philosophy on a matter of operational independence between the view I have expressed and the view expressed in the Patten report. If the view expressed in the Patten report is relied upon as justifying the amendment we are discussing, why was that view not taken in 2000 when the Act was passed? What has made it necessary now?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that is a perfectly legitimate question. At that stage, it was thought that ground four ought to be included. Since then, at least two things have happened. First, there has been the experience of the Chief Constable working with the board. Secondly, the implementation report came to the conclusion that ground four was not required. As the noble and learned Lord said, when we made our response to the implementation plan, which was post the 2000 Act, the Government gave the commitment which they are now honouring in this Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for his explanations and I thank noble Lords for taking part in the debate. My noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew made a reasoned argument and the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, who has considerable experience working on the Policing Board, has explained his views and fears.
<P>

<a name="30123-07_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, made some political points which I do not necessarily accept or agree with. I agree with the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal that this is not a Bill entirely for Sinn Fein. Many parts of it are practical, sensible and good and are well supported by the Policing Board and by the Chief Constable. I met the Chief Constable as recently as Monday, but on the understanding with him that I would not repeat anything we discussed. I shall say no more on the matter, if your Lordships will forgive me.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-07_para1"></a>There is a slightly different philosophical approach. I am surprised that it is coming from Her Majesty's Government, particularly in the light of recent changes in the Kingdom in regard to security, policing and the management of crime and criminals and terrorism and terrorists. The Government's record on that has not so far been good, but they are taking serious steps to attempt more strongly to secure our nation&#151;except in this Bill and in parts of Northern Ireland. The Province is already far less secure and has suffered from crime and terrorism far more than any other part of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30123-07_para2"></a>My main point is that the Patten report was written on the understanding that the members of the commission did not expect it to be implemented immediately or to be implemented all at once. They did not expect parts of the report to be implemented until such time as society in Northern Ireland was living in a normal and peaceful way, as other people do in other parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30123-07_para3"></a>Patently that has not yet happened. Perhaps we are near it, but I do not believe that. I think that we have a very long way to go. Even if we were to get Stormont operating again, if Sinn Fein were to take part on the Policing Board, or even if the IRA publicly and obviously stood down, I can say from the meetings that I have had in north and west Belfast over the weekend and which my honourable friend Quentin Davies, who serves in another place, has had with people in east Belfast, that what is happening in Northern Ireland is horrifying. There are vicious terror gangs, turf wars and gun-running, so it is not a normal part of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30123-07_para4"></a>My key complaint about this part of the Bill is that it will do the things that the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, said. It is too soon; it will put the community at risk. Her Majesty's Government do not have a right to put the community in any part of the United Kingdomat risk. I should love to support the Government in a Bill to normalise things. I cannot wait for the day, but as an inhabitant of that country, it not safe to do so yet.
<P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass </B>   moved Amendment No. 12:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 7, line 4, leave out "subsections (2) and" and insert "subsection"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-08_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30123-08_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment relates again to the numbers game. It is difficult to understand why, with 19 board members, the cut-off is to be only eight. That is 40 per cent with regard to those who can demand an inquiry. During debate on the previous amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked the relevant question of how often the provision had been invoked to the extent that numbers mattered. At either Second Reading or in Committee, my noble friend Lord Rogan asked the same question. On both occasions, the Minister intimated that it had not been <P>


<a name="column_865"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 865</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>invoked. One has to ask, therefore, as did the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, why, in the short period of three years, we have to have this change.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para2"></a>On another matter, the Minister indicated that evidence relating to how the board had worked justified Government making the change. However, having told us on this issue that there is no evidence whatever, that argument does not stand up. One has to query, therefore, whether the provision relates to the Government's intention to bring Sinn Fein on to the board. I shall not fall out with my noble friend Lord Glentoran when he discovers some good in some parts of the Bill. Nonetheless, we are on dangerous ground when inferring the Chief Constable's support by virtue of a conversation with him which cannot be reported to this House.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para3"></a>In talking about democracy, I should have thought that we would apply some of those democratic rules to the Policing Board and would not be making special arrangements for only 40 per cent of the board to be able to invoke an inquiry. The mischievousness of Sinn Fein at the table when it is not in substantially powerful positions is a lesson which could be learned. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-08_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment. During debate on removal of the clause, the Minister made a remark&#151;I hope that he will not repeat it&#151;on the Chief Constable's experience of the board. There is a brand new Chief Constable: I do not know how that remark came about. In terms of life in the Province, strategic points of view, and so on, six months does not warrant comments about experience of the board. I hope that eventually, under proper conditions, Sinn Fein comes on. The board will change; we have to wait far longer to see how it will work. However, I am grateful for the remarks about how well he thinks we are doing.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para4"></a>At the moment, the board consists of 19 members. We have got 10, which is fractionally over half. It is quite simple. The strength of the Policing Board is that it is community-based and has a collective responsibility in making its decisions; it is a cross-community body. Even though Sinn Fein is not represented, the composition of the board takes into account various community backgrounds. It correctly reflects the community of Northern Ireland and the basic religious divide. So let us not say that because Sinn Fein is not represented at the moment the board does not reflect those proportions&#151;it does.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para5"></a>If and when Sinn Fein is represented on the independent members' side, I understand that, unless there is a change in the law to provide for a different number of people on the board, there will be a slight change in the number of independents. Because there would be two more speaking from the nationalist or the Roman Catholic point of view, a change will be made to the independent side so that the board continues to reflect a balance. So we are not talking about a lack of balance on the board.
<P>


<a name="column_866"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 866</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para6"></a>At the moment, a decision needs to be taken by more than 50 per cent of the board. In public, a board decision will be a collective responsibility to run an inquiry, report, or whatever. The public see that the decision is made under collective responsibility by more than 50 per cent of the board. It is extremely important that no decision is made without 50 per cent of the board being present.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para7"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, slightly side-stepped the question of who had brought forward this issue, but when I spoke to someone in the SDLP about it, he accepted that his party was very much behind it. Whether or not it was put to him in words is neither here nor there, his party was very much behind it. I asked him why and he said it would enable a smaller number of people to cause an inquiry to take place.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para8"></a>I asked how it would work. He said, "If we want an inquiry, we need to get only eight people together for that to happen". I said, "But some on the other side might be against it"&#151;although, for all I know, I could be in favour of an inquiry&#151;and he said, "Well, under the circumstances, it could happen when no one else was available. We could call a meeting and, with eight of us, we could get it through".
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para9"></a>I said, "Okay, let us put it the other way. I want an inquiry into something, how do I run it?" He said, "You find eight people, get agreement and you do it". I said, "But then it is a decision made by less than 50 per cent of the board". He said, "That's right". So I said, "If I wanted to do it and you didn't, what would be your response?" He said, "My response would be that, as soon as I could, I would find nine or 10 members. We would then get together and change the decision".
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para10"></a>It is farcical to pose problems that will have to be solved in a totally irrational way. It is amazing that we are setting up a body that, under extreme conditions&#151;we are not talking about something that will happen every day&#151;would allow me to find eight people who will agree with me, get them into a huddle, and make a decision knowing very well that, because I had to struggle, the other 10 members will not agree. I know that, otherwise I would not bother; I would bring up the matter as normal before the board. So, again, there is a safety net.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para11"></a>Let us now assume that I get the decision I want and it is minuted that we will have an inquiry into such and such. One, two or three weeks later, the others, realising that I did this while they were at the opera or the theatre or whatever, get together and decide to revoke the decision because they are the board. It should be remembered that, out of eight members, it would need only five to force the issue. But it is a collective decision, and I believe that the board should, and does, work under the principle of collective decision. I know that certain people do not keep confidences but, on the whole, the board does work as a body.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para12"></a>This is the most amazing enabling clause. It is a farce, and it will be seen as a farce by everyone. The Minister's reply may be that this small group should be allowed to make such decisions because it is so <P>


<a name="column_867"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 867</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasonable, but the independents are weighted slightly more towards one side at the moment. However, I remind the House that the divisions reflect the community. The Government tried to create a Policing Board that is fair, reflects the community and is accepted by the public. They have done so, but this undermines it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, although my Amendment No. 17 is not in this group, perhaps I may speak to it now. It effectively deals with the same issues. I give notice that I do not intend to divide the House on Amendment No. 17 today.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para13"></a>I find it difficult to add to the persuasiveness of the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough. We have rehearsed the arguments. I understand from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal that Clause 10 represents a lowering of the threshold&#151;which it does&#151;and that the important words are "present and voting". But, not for the first time in our discussions on the Bill, I fail to see any logic in the justification for this change.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para14"></a>Certain noble Lords to whom I have spoken have told me that in public bodies of this nature in England, more than 50 per cent of the representatives never turn up; that the figure is usually about 30 per cent or 20 per cent. That is not my experience, but it may be the experience in England. Even if it is, that is all the more reason for maintaining the higher number required to take decisions.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para15"></a>In something as sensitive as policing in Northern Ireland, why are the Government taking risks by reducing the level to below 50 per cent of those required on the Policing Board for the Police Service of Northern Ireland? After the debates in the Grand Committee and recent visits to the Police Service and other parts of Belfast, I cannot see any logic or reason for this. I cannot see the positive side. I cannot see what is so good about this that it is important to change the legislation which, as we have said, is only two years old. It is taking a risk with the security, policing and lives of the people of Northern Ireland. It is time that the Government stopped doing it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the genesis of this change is in the implementation plan of 2001. The Government intend, after the review, to provide that the number of members present and voting for a proposal for an inquiry should be eight so long as&#151;let me stress these words&#151;that is the majority of those present and voting.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para16"></a>It is fanciful to suggest that a gang of eight can bring this about while others are at the opera. First, an inquiry follows receipt of a report under Section 59 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. Paragraph 18 of Schedule 1 to the Act provides that at least three members have to have made a written request to the chairman asking him to call a meeting. Paragraph 18(2) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The chairman shall, no later than three working days after the day on which he receives the request, call such a meeting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-08_para17"></a><P>


<a name="column_868"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 868</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Paragraph 18(3) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The meeting shall be held no earlier than six, and no later than twenty-one, working days after that day".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-08_para18"></a>
Critically for the opera lovers, paragraph 18(4) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The chairman shall notify each member of the Board of the date and purpose of the meeting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-08_para19"></a>
Those are mandatory requirements.
<P>

<a name="30123-08_para20"></a>The noble Viscount will know as well as I do that in 2002 an overall attendance of 90 per cent was achieved; three-quarters of all board members attended at least 12 of the 13 board meetings. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. The threshold will be lowered to eight although the board consists of 19 members, but there has to be a majority of those present and voting. With deep deference, I believe that the fears are overblown.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030123/text/30123-09.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I beg to disagree with the noble and learned Lord on the latter point. Our fears are not overblown. The reality is that at the moment we live in a non-stable society. That lack of stability is brought about by the role of paramilitaries. I know that some have suggested that I am politicising what is a police matter. I am not politicising it; it is politicised by the nature of the Bill. It is politicised by this change that suggests that eight out of 19 is somehow a magical figure that can be attractive to the SDLP and to Sinn Fein.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para0"></a>For the past 20 years in public life I have worked with the SDLP. At times I find that it assumes certain attitudes because it is fighting in the community for the same votes as Sinn Fein. Matters are not always as they appear. If noble Lords had had experiences, as I have, in local government in Northern Ireland, they would find that in that context that is true.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para1"></a>In this unstable society of ours, Sinn Fein, for electoral reasons or for much more dubious and dangerous reasons, has the ability to intimidate. Anything that brings us down to that marginal area where intimidation, not just of politicians who are associated with the board but also of independent members who are on the board, may occur is dangerous in the extreme. For the reasons I have already enunciated and because there has never been any difficulty in regard to the previous figure of 10, I cannot understand why, without proven justification, the figure is now to be reduced to eight. I had intended to divide the House on this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-09_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, perhaps he would say whether he agrees with the reason given: that the Government feel there is simply no chance of such low numbers occurring. Just in case such a situation happened, does he agree that the reason for changing the figure is absolutely wrong and unfounded?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I hope that that is the point I made. I am grateful to the noble Viscount for endorsing the matter. I had intended to seek the opinion of the House at this stage, but I shall <P>

Previously, we dealt with the issue of whether an investigation could be retrospective; whether it could relate to matters that had occurred before the Bill became law. On that previous occasion the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams, gave what I assumed was an unequivocal assurance. At a later stage he said something that suggested that that may not be the case. I apologise for not having the reference. My reason for moving this amendment is to try to understand the position on retrospection. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I can give a satisfactory assurance. At Second Reading I hoped I had made plain that it is not the Government's intention that the power to investigate police policies and practices will be retrospective. The amendment that I brought forward in Grand Committee made it clear that the ombudsman's power is limited to current policies and practices.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para7"></a>In investigating current police practices, it would be natural for the ombudsman to inform herself of the way in which officers conducted themselves in applying those policies and practices that are current. In other words, if we accepted this amendment&#151;I understand that it is intended to be probing&#151;the ombudsman, in applying current practices, would not be able to look at conduct if that conduct had occurred perhaps two weeks before Royal Assent. I hope that I have made the distinction clear. This power is not to be retrospective in respect of past policies and practices. If the policy is current, the ombudsman will have to use her discretion as to what practices she considers. I hope that that is satisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord. That is clear. He has endeavoured to be helpful. Before Third Reading perhaps I can ask him to consider this matter to discover whether it could be interpreted in a way that differs from his present intention. I believe that if there were enough pressure to consider a matter that was retrospective, it might be possible to say that <P>


<a name="column_870"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>something that applied to that retrospective issue is applicable today and so by using that as a starting point there would be justification for being retrospective.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para8"></a>I hope I have made myself clear and that the noble and learned Lord understands the point I have made. I shall be grateful if, at a later stage, he can make a statement that would secure matters in the terms I have enunciated. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

 "REMOVAL OF DISCRIMINATION FROM RECRUITMENT
<br>
(1) In Part 6 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 (c. 32) for section 46 substitute&#151;
<br>
"46 UNDER-REPRESENTATION
<br>
(1) In making appointments under section 39 the Chief Constable may take such steps as he determines appropriate to encourage applications by persons currently under-represented in the police service.
<br>
(2) In making appointments to the police support staff under section 4(3) the Chief Constable (acting by virtue of subsection (5) of that section) may take such steps as he determines appropriate to encourage applications by persons currently under-represented in the police support staff.
<br>
(3) For the purposes of this section "persons currently under-represented" means persons forming part of a social group by virtue of their sex, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation who at the time of consideration by the Chief Constable are under-represented."
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-09_para27"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment seeks to insert a new clause, on the removal of discrimination from recruitment, in Part 6 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. This is not a new issue. Many noble Lords will no doubt remember the highly contentious debate in this House on 15th November 2000 on the 50:50 recruitment arrangement. Noble Lords may also remember the result of the vote held on that day when 50:50 was narrowly carried by 185 to 175 votes.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para28"></a>The principle of equality of opportunity is central to the Belfast agreement. Policing, however, is apparently regarded as an exception. The fact is that 50:50 denies equality of opportunity. It is nothing short of discrimination. We have always been opposed to 50:50 on that basis. The new clause proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass, and myself clearly states our position.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para29"></a>The 50:50 principle requires that 50 per cent of those appointed from a pool of qualified applicants to the PSNI must be "persons who are treated as Roman Catholic" and 50 per cent must be "persons who are not so treated"&#151;the "other" category. That clearly discriminates against the Protestant community, not to mention the substantial population in Northern Ireland who practise "other" or, indeed, no religion.
<P>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 872</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para30"></a>During passage of the Bill which became the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, many in this place agreed with this position. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am sorry to see a Bill being passed which flies in the face of human rights legislation and which inevitably at some stage must cause problems".&#151;[Official Report, 15/10/00; col. 286.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-09_para31"></a>
In another place, Mr Lembit Opik, on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, vigorously opposed the measure on the same grounds. He said that we should not "monkey around" with human rights.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para32"></a>Given that human rights are so central to liberal philosophy, we were rather surprised when the Liberal Democrats in this place acquiesced in relation to such discriminatory provisions. They may even have warranted the accusation made by the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, that they were "in bed with Blair". As the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead, put it in 2000, the Liberal Democrats,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will be aware of the consequences of permitting the discrimination genie to escape from the bottle".&#151;[Official Report, 15/11/00; col. 282.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-09_para33"></a>
I hope that, today, they and others will join us in putting the cap back on the bottle.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para34"></a>I do not intend to retread old ground and repeat old arguments. However, the situation in Northern Ireland has evidently changed since 2000. Two years down the line, we are in a position to reflect on the decisions of that year, to learn from experience and indeed to correct any mistakes. I do not wish to adopt the churlish attitude of, "We told you so", but it is clear that the predictions made in 2000 by many opponents of 50:50 have been realised.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para35"></a>Since passage of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, and as a response to the Patten recommendations, the number of police officers has been dramatically reduced. The service has been virtually cut in half, to less than 6,902 officers&#151;well below the figure recommended by Patten as the minimum level needed to police Northern Ireland. While 1,874 full-time reservists currently complement the police service, they, too, will be phased out after 2005.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para36"></a>Many in this House and in another place voiced concerns in 2000 about the effects that such a reduction in numbers would have on expertise, experience and effectiveness in the police service. Reports in the Observer newspaper, in March 2002, pointed to a severe shortage in the top echelons of the service&#151;a shortage of chief superintendents, superintendents, chief inspectors and sergeants, not to mention a serious shortage of constables. It was also revealed that many policemen and women who lost their jobs in the RUC's fingerprint bureau under Patten's reforms were re-employed in the PSNI as civilian technicians due to critical shortages of manpower and expertise in this area.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para37"></a>Rather than increasing the applications and helping to build a first-rate police service, the 50:50 arrangements are clearly impeding recruitment and have resulted in a severe shortage of manpower. Last month, the chairman of the Police Federation, Mr Irwin Montgomery, said that the rigid enforcement of a policy requiring Catholics <P>


<a name="column_873"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 873</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and Protestants to be recruited in equal numbers was starving Northern Ireland's already overstretched police service of officer and civilian staff.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para38"></a>One recent training class had just 34 students&#151;17 Roman Catholics and 17 others&#151;when it should have had 48. The Chief Constable, Mr Hugh Orde, also reported recently that one of his priorities, to civilianise as many administrative posts as possible in order to get more officers out on patrol and doing front-line police work, was being frustrated by the policy of 50:50 recruitment.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para39"></a>A recent trawl for 200 administrative assistants produced 250 suitable applicants from the "other" category, but only 28 from the Roman Catholic category, meaning that only 48 people could be taken on. This is the central issue. It is a catch-22 situation: 50:50 has led to a reduction in the number of police officers. The most obvious solution is to free officers from administrative posts, yet administrative posts are also subject to 50:50 and these places, too, cannot be filled.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para40"></a>I do not wish to appear to exaggerate, but the situation is extremely grave. Your Lordships need only consider street violence, so prevalent in Belfast throughout the summer months, or the continuing loyalist feuds in the city. The reality is, as recent events have shown, that terrorism is still a force to be reckoned with in Northern Ireland. Whatever the rhetoric on both sides of the community in Northern Ireland, there is terrorism. Crime levels are rising at an unprecedented rate. It seems absurd that at such a time the police service should be under-staffed and over-stretched. This is clearly a good time to be a criminal in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para41"></a>In Committee a few weeks ago the Lord Privy Seal, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, gave some encouraging figures about PSNI recruitment. We very much welcome the fact that the percentage of applicants from the catholic community has risen to 36 per cent. However, that does not address the crux of the matter. Such figures do not reflect the level of recruitment. In the year 2000 we said that solving the problem of Catholic under-representation in the police service lay not in their appointment, but indeed in their willingness to apply. If we can tackle the application process, quotas for recruitment would be entirely unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para42"></a>The rise in the number of applications from Roman Catholics reflects the welcome endorsement of the PSNI by the SDLP, the Catholic Church and the decision by the SDLP to join the Police Board. Sinn Fein/IRA, however, still refuse to accept the new police service. Indeed, they continue actively to discourage young Catholics from joining the PSNI. Intimidation and attacks on Catholic recruits by the republican movement still continue. One recent recruit in Ballymena narrowly escaped injury last year from a booby trap placed underneath his car. Another recruit in Newry was forced to flee his home after threats.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para43"></a>The reality is that many of those who would like to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland are either forced to forego their policing ambition for fear of <P>


<a name="column_874"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 874</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intimidation or choose to move across the water rather than run the risk of endangering themselves or their families and being subjected to abuse within their own communities.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para44"></a>Nor do the Sinn Fein/IRA representatives encourage their constituents to co-operate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland or report criminal activity to the police. Recently, when a young girl was savagely raped in west Belfast last November, the Sinn Fein Assembly Member for the area was unwilling to advise her concerned constituents to speak to the police service. Rather she preferred that they spoke to
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"those whom they could trust in the constituency and who have been looking after things in the constituency".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-09_para45"></a><P>

<a name="30123-09_para46"></a>I repeat that 50:50 recruitment arrangements do nothing to tackle the problem of intimidation, the root of the problem of Catholic under-representation. As the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead, said in November, 2000,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Surely, encouraging applicants from under-represented sections of society&#151;all under-represented sections of society&#151;is the only effective means of addressing the problems and to achieve the prize of a police service that reflects the society that it polices".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-09_para47"></a><P>

<a name="30123-09_para48"></a>Discrimination in any form is unacceptable; discrimination in the Police Service of Northern Ireland is especially unacceptable. Introduced for whatever good reasons, 50:50 recruitment arrangements do not solve the problem of Catholic under-representation. The new Police Service of Northern Ireland is entirely frustrated in its attempts to police the community, suffering as it does from a lack of recruits. With the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill before the House today, we have an opportunity to review the decisions of the year 2000. We have an opportunity to make the necessary changes that would allow the PSNI to develop into the effective, first-rate police service Northern Ireland deserves. We have the opportunity to remove discrimination. I beg to move.

Because it is always extremely hazardous to board a moving train, I have not tried to join in the amendments today, but I have one stand-alone question.
<P>

<a name="30123-09_para49"></a>My noble kinsman the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, asked a question at col. GC55 of the Official Report on 9th January about the numbers recruited into civil servant jobs, which would enable police to be released for active duty on the streets. At col. GC56, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal gave the answer, which showed Catholic recruitment of 13.3 per cent as against 36 per cent which he had referred to at col. GC55 for Catholics joining the police itself. Given the consequences of this particular imbalance, which is of itself interesting, has any research been done by the PSNI as to why recruitment on the civil servant side has been so much lower than into the police?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030123/text/30123-10.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-10_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, the 50:50 issue is a problem which affects the number of police on the <P>


<a name="column_875"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 875</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ground. We must do everything we can to increase those numbers. Except for one particular training course, we are just managing to fill the quotas. I believe that we are marginally ahead in total on what was estimated at the beginning. There is still a problem.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, referred to a recent "trawl". I would not like that to be taken the wrong way. The noble Lord was referring to civilian support staff. It is not a trawl such as someone going out to find people, it is a straightforward public competition, as they are now called. It is a recruiting competition in exactly the same way as it is for policemen. It is not a trawl.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para1"></a>As regards the competition and the figures of 26 or 28 Roman Catholics being available, there were 238 Protestants available. The effect is that every job which could be civilianised and thereby release a policemen is extremely important under the present circumstances. I ask the noble and learned Lord one question. Whereas one cannot have a short contract policeman who joins policing for a few months, in administrative work with secretaries and administrative jobs in offices, surely it might be possible in the interim, while continuing to recruit, to have people on short-term contracts, medium-term temps, which would immediately release the police officers holding such posts. Because they would be on temporary contracts, when and if the 50:50 quota from those recruited into the police support staff as whole comes about, those people could be released from the contracts. That would at least release policemen to go out on the streets today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, for reminding me of prophecies I uttered in your Lordships' House some three years ago. I remember on that occasion a vast number of noble Lords, mainly on my left, saying that I was sending out the wrong signals. I ask them to think about the validity of that allegation.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para2"></a>I do not want to rehearse what has been put forward effectively by colleagues. However, I should like some reassurance from the Government. It is clear that the situation in Northern Ireland is getting out of hand, whether through terrorism, so-called Real IRA activities or the activities of various other types of IRA. There can be no distinction. They must all be contained and, if possible, obliterated. That must be our objective.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para3"></a>On behalf of those who will be butchered in the months and years ahead, I seek assurance that, without any undue publicity, Her Majesty's Government are turning their mind to what will be done in practical terms to remedy a horrific situation. I know enough, having served in the forces in times of war and on other occasions, to be aware that no government ever contemplate the future without a contingency plan. I hope it is not too much to ask the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal, not necessarily to reveal to us what that plan is, but to assure us that a plan does indeed exist, not only to contain terrorism, but also to arrest its development in Northern Ireland. We shall all sleep easier in our beds&#151;some have good personal reasons for <P>


<a name="column_876"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 876</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>including that qualification&#151;if we know that Her Majesty's Government have a contingency plan and intend to implement it as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I intervene briefly on Amendment No. 28 to remind the House that, initially, I would have been deemed to be out of step with my party colleagues on the issue of 50:50 recruiting. But some noble Lords will have seen the recent census of Northern Ireland. There is not a huge imbalance between the two major traditions.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para4"></a>In conversations with Patten, I suggested that we could be in a situation where, if there was an avalanche of applicants and ultimately of recruits from both traditions, a short window of opportunity might be created when there could be an endeavour to recruit on a 50:50 basis. In that situation, confidence would be created which would draw both traditions into active and practical support of the police.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para5"></a>Unfortunately, a number of mistakes were made. One was that the window of opportunity was left open far too wide. There became no urgency for young men and women within the Roman Catholic tradition to make a decision. With the ongoing pressure that comes from paramilitaries like the Real and Continuity IRA, and still comes from the Provisional IRA, it is only natural that young Catholic men and women should hold back. The window of opportunity will still be open further down the road, but in the interim the process fails to work.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para6"></a>My noble friend Lord Brookebrough said that we were marginally holding on. "Marginally holding on" means that standards requirements in terms of recruitment are falling. For instance, at the initial stage recruits are not asked to demonstrate their academic attainment. That has gone almost unnoticed. But something noble Lords will find unbelievable is that physical fitness standards are no longer set or required for recruits to the PSNI. They have been wiped out. When before, in the western world, did there ever exist a police service when physical fitness standards were totally ignored? What sort of policemen and police women is that likely to put on our streets over the next months and years? It is a nonsense.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para7"></a>That shows the extent to which the bottom of the pot has been scraped in order to enable a process to survive which simply is not working. While no one wishes more than I to see a large element of Roman Catholic members within the police&#151;that is my party's policy&#151;I do not believe that to achieve it we should denigrate every applicant by scraping the bottom of the barrel. I shall be grateful if the noble and learned Lord addresses that specific point when he responds.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I shall not detain the House; it is long past lunch time. I cannot support Amendment No. 28.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para8"></a>Since Patten, and since my right honourable friend Andrew Mackay was shadow Secretary of State, until today, the Conservative Party has consistently supported the 50:50 principle. We now know, as a result of the <P>


<a name="column_877"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 877</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>census, that we are talking about a population in the ratio of 45:55. On that principle I cannot support the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para9"></a>However, I accept that there is a problem to which the Government must attend. I attempted, rather hurriedly and not very satisfactorily, to table some thoughts in the form of a probing amendment, Amendment No. 29A, which I hope we shall have a chance to debate later today. I may well wish to test the opinion of the House at Third Reading on that point, having had a chance to refine and tune the amendment. However, I am not, in principle, able to support the amendment of my friends in the Ulster Unionist Party.

The two main criticisms appear to be, first, that there are not enough recruits, and, secondly, that civilianisation is being impeded. In fact 530 recruits were appointed in the first year of the policy. That is substantially in excess of the Patten model figure of 370. In any event, as your Lordships know, the Act of 2000 allows for the quota to be adjusted on any occasion if there is a shortage of recruits. But that has not been necessary.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para10"></a>I accept the point made that there was an exodus of experienced officers from the police service. But a variation of 50:50 for new recruits would not have affected that. I understand that the board agreed a revised timetable with the Chief Constable for the severance programme.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para11"></a>On civilianisation, the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, asked a specific question about the disparity in figures. The short answer is that because the arrangements for the recruitment of civilians on a 50:50 basis were set up around 12 months after those for police officers, there has been a lag. And the contractor appointed to oversee civilian recruitment&#151;Grafton&#151;was only appointed last September. The Chief Constable's observations about the difficulties with respect to civilianisation preceded the appointment of Grafton. I understand that the police plan to launch a further campaign for administrative staff shortly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-10_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, the Chief Constable's comments were made shortly before Christmas in the newspaper. That seems well after the appointment of Grafton.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the advice that I have is different, and I will check that. I would not want to have misled the House inadvertently on wrong advice.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para12"></a>On civilianisation, the competitions run so far by Grafton have been successful. Sufficient numbers of candidates from both community backgrounds have come forward to allow vacancies to be filled on a 50:50 basis where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para13"></a>The noble Viscount asked a number of questions about short-term contracts. In some posts, there is scope for such contracts. Where the police service thinks it appropriate, it can follow that option. However, as he <P>


<a name="column_878"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 878</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would accept, in many posts there is a need for expertise and training, and long-term recruitment is the way forward for that.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para14"></a>Grafton is already running eight different competitions for the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para15"></a>Amendment No. 29, of which not a lot was said, would place a requirement on the Secretary of State to make an order adjusting the ratio. As I pointed out a moment or two ago, the Secretary of State's power under the 2000 Act has never been used. It may be helpful to say that if the Policing Board wanted to agree to a limited change to get round a lack of experienced officers, obviously we would look at it very carefully. Noble Lords may agree, however, that that is essentially an issue for the board to consider in the first instance with the Chief Constable.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para16"></a>The Chief Constable's comments around and about Christmas referred to a competition that took place before Grafton's appointment, so I think that I was right to say that he was referring to the pre-Grafton situation.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, asked about the Government's plans and proposals. As I have told noble Lords more than once, the Government's hope is that the Assembly elections will be held in May. That is what the Secretary of State has said on a number of occasions. Plainly, any prudent government will have alternatives in mind depending on what develops.
<P>

<a name="30123-10_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, referred to physical competence. The test for that will not be applied to applicants in the current recruitment programme, but all trainees will be required to pass the test before they are attested.

<A NAME="30123-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rogan: </B>   My Lords, I wish to thank all noble Lords who contributed to the debate. As I have said repeatedly, 50:50 is not a new issue. The removal of the discrimination in our police service is one of tremendous importance to the people of Northern Ireland and the future of policing. We in the Ulster Unionist Party have been consistent on the issue.

<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Marlesford </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will abolish game licences.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, licences for taking and dealing in game are intended to discourage poaching, to encourage compliance with close seasons for the conservation of quarry species, and to protect food safety. Representations indicate that food retailers, among others, would welcome changes. We are sympathetic to that. However, we need to reflect carefully on the way forward, taking into account the wider implications of any decision to reform the current arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as one of the 8 per cent of holders of shotgun licences who has bought a game licence. As the Government know perfectly well&#151;the Minister gave me a Written Answer two weeks ago&#151;these licences cost more to collect than they produce. They collect an infinitesimally small amount&#151;a quarter of a million pounds. Nobody is prosecuted for not having a game licence. Surely, unenforced laws are bad laws. Are the Government not keen, in these marginal circumstances, to lift the burden of this and other similarly nonsensical licences lurking in Whitehall? Will they not do something about it? We need action not words.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, 49,000 people have taken out a game licence. The regime has implications for conservation, the preservation of quality of the retail trade, and gun laws, with which it interfaces, so it would be complex to change it. In principle, I agree with the noble Lord. If the price of a game licence had kept pace with inflation, it would be about 2,000 rather than 6.
<P>

<a name="30123-11_para6"></a>Further to the noble Lord's last remark, I hope that he does not blame this Government or their immediate predecessors. The blame rests entirely with the Liberal Democrats, as it was the late Lord Grey and the late Lord Palmerston who introduced the provisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew5"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as having paid 2 at Christmas for a game licence to allow me to participate in taking game for two weeks. I am interested to hear the Minister say that he regards licensing as a deterrent to poaching. Has he heard that the Durham police force will no longer take up poaching cases? How does that fit with the Government's promise to be tough on crime?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, it ill behoves a Minister to comment on the operational priorities of any chief constable. Nevertheless, I am sure that the Durham police force is concentrating on other rural crime issues. The contribution of game licences to the prevention of <P>


<a name="column_880"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 880</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>poaching may not be as great as it was when they cost substantially more, and when poaching was one of the biggest crimes in the countryside.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, given the reasons the Minister gave in his first Answer and the changes that may be brought about if the Hunting Bill is passed, is his department reviewing the question of tagging deer carcasses? They are subject to particular problems and would benefit very much from tagging. When the House discussed the matter previously, some of the impediments were technological. They have been overcome in the nine years since the House last discussed this in depth.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the regime covering the taking and marketing of deer could benefit from better traceability measures, including tagging. I understand that not all the technological and operational impediments have been overcome, but, when that happens, the Government will regard such measures as desirable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, if the Government are not prepared to withdraw the licence to kill game, will they take steps to ensure that a larger proportion of those killing game have such licences, if they feel it necessary? If not, why not support my noble friend Lord Marlesford?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the implication of what I have said on behalf of the Government is that this is a complex area. If it were just a question of licensing the taking of game, and considering the implications for the discouragement of poaching, it would be easy to remove the regime. But there are also implications for conservation and the regulations on the use of game for food. If we removed the licensing regime, those complexities would need to be addressed and would possibly be replaced.

<P>
<UL>What action they propose to take following the publication by Direct Line of evidence of the dangers of using mobile phones while driving.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government have noted the findings of the Direct Line research published last March. The Department for Transport issued a consultation document on 20th August last year seeking views on a proposal to prohibit the use of hand-held mobile phones when driving. The consultation period closed on 25th November. More than 1,000 responses have been received and these are now being considered. An announcement on the results of consultation will be made as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply and the prospect of some action by the <P>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 881</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government. Is he aware that the Direct Line reports states that the use of hand-held mobile telephones is far more dangerous than driving at the alcohol limit? When drivers exceed the alcohol limit they incur penalties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of it. That is why my response on our knowledge of the Direct Line report was so neutral, and why I said only that we noted it. What the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, says is true, but it would be wrong to conclude that it is less damaging or illegal to drive while under the influence of drink or drugs. That is a message not just for Christmas but throughout the year. It must be reinforced on all possible occasions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, the Minister will be aware that health and safety legislation imposes on employers a duty to provide a safe working environment for their employees. But is it not the case that many firms not only fail to offer advice to their employees about using mobile phones when driving but that they regard the car as an extension of the office and encourage staff to make calls while on the move? Should it not be a priority to discourage that practice?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, as one who previously employed salesmen to whom we issued mobile phones&#151;hands-free sets, I hasten to add&#151;I acknowledge the force of what the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, says. This is one of the issues that must be considered in the consultation process in which we have been involved and in the conclusions we draw from it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the subject was raised in this House as long ago as 1997 when the Government's response was that it was for the police to decide whether the distraction materially reduced a driver's care and attention? Is that still the situation? Some telephone conversations can be very distracting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, more recently, the police have advised us that they have adequate powers, under regulation 104 of the Construction and Use Regulations 1986, to prosecute anyone who is not in control of a vehicle. That could result in a prosecution for careless or dangerous driving. Things have moved on since then; not least, the enormous increase in the number of mobile phones in this country. We have undertaken consultation because of increasing pressure of that kind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-11_spnew18"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the Mayor of London is encouraging payment for congestion charges by using text messages on mobile telephones? Does he think that this is a contribution to road safety?

<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that evidence given by the police indicates that fines will not deter drivers from using mobile phones? However, points on the licence would deter them. Therefore, we should perhaps move straight to points on the licence for the use of mobile phones.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, may or may not know that the RAC published a report on this subject only this week. It comes to the conclusion, supported by 90 per cent of respondents, that there should be a ban on hand-held mobile phones and that it should be a comparable offence to speeding&#151;in other words, a combination of fines and penalty points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, what would be the position of the emergency services who may well have to use mobile phones or radios in the course of their duties while driving?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I would be astonished if the emergency services were reduced to using hand-held mobile phones.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, while it is not only reasonable but highly desirable to ban the use of mobile phones while driving, would it not be going too far to ban their use when a driver is stuck at a traffic jam with his handbrake on?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that is one of the issues which the Government are considering in the consultation process. If use was banned while a driver was stopped in a traffic jam, we would not be alone. Germany has such a ban. I do not believe we should anticipate the results of the consultation. We should not rule out a complete ban while in control of a vehicle.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Methuen: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that provincial taxi drivers are particularly bad offenders at using mobile phones while on the move?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not use provincial taxi drivers, so I do not have any direct experience. If taxi drivers use the phone as a work tool, it would be particularly irresponsible if it were a hand-held phone. In all this talk about the difference between hand-held and hand-free phones, I should point out that the <P>


<a name="column_883"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 883</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Direct Line research did show that using a hand-free phone also reduced the response times of drivers significantly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, would the noble Lord agree that if hand-free telephones are regarded as so dangerous, then so is any form of conversation. Will he not, therefore, prohibit talking while in a car?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, again this is a matter for consultation.

<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I cannot stand up and think at the same time.
<P>

<a name="30123-12_para0"></a>My Lords, the evidence I have just given from the Direct Line research ought to be taken seriously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, whatever the legislative framework&#151;whether we adopt a new one or continue with the assurances I gave the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, when he asked the original Question&#151;is it not true that reducing the use of mobile phones while people are driving will depend on enforcement which, in turn, depends on the resources that the police are able to devote to the enforcement of traffic offences?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, indeed it does. It is because of the lack of enforcement of the existing offence under the construction and use regulations that there has been this shift of emphasis towards a direct ban. The enforcement issue is particularly important for hand-free phones. How can someone outside a car tell whether a hand-free phone is being used?

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the Government have undertaken to make sustainable improvements in the economic performance of all English regions. In addition, we have for the first time undertaken to reduce the persistent gap in growth rates between them over the long term. Our policies towards the north-east of England, both directly and through the regional development agency, ONE North East, are directed towards achieving this end.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington: </B>   My Lords, the Government have done a great deal for the north-east of England, although I am not quite so impressed by what my noble friend has said in relation to the actual position. Does he agree that there is a continuing <P>


<a name="column_884"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 884</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difficulty in the region in that it constantly has the highest rate of unemployment in the country? I understand that it has had the highest rate since such figures have been kept. What does my noble friend think is the cause of what I might describe as the inconsistency of the region? When a new factory opens with 500 jobs, it is frequently followed by the closure of a factory with a similar number of jobs. Could not the Government give more assistance to the regional development agency, ONE North East, which makes such a valuable contribution to the region's economy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am not at all happy about the performance of the north-east of England. The gap between that region and the rest of England has not only not fallen but has been increasing in recent years. The heavy dependence on manufacturing industry, which is still enormously important in the North East, is partly to do with that. As to the unemployment figures, for many years there has been a difference of about 2.5 per cent between the figures for the North East and the figures for the rest of the country&#151;and the North East has been the worst. If it is any consolation, the unemployment figure for the North East is now 6.7 per cent, which is only 1.5 per cent greater than the national average. This must be, by a long way, the lowest unemployment figure in the region for a long time.
<P>

<a name="30123-12_para1"></a>As to the regional development agency, I agree entirely with my noble friend. We are increasing our grant to ONE North East from 189 million this year to around 227 million next year. This is in recognition of the need for the excellent work that it does.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, given that there are many rural areas in the North East, what are the Government doing to promote the spread of broadband? It is particularly difficult for many rural areas in the North East because they do not qualify for European assistance in the promotion of broadband. Without government help, it will be difficult to meet the Government's target of bringing broadband not only to businesses but to doctors' surgeries.
<P>

<a name="30123-12_para2"></a>Does the Minister believe that the particularly strong bid by Newcastle and Gateshead to become the European City of Culture will automatically help the north-east economy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew18"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, it is very good news for the North East that Newcastle and Gateshead are on the shortlist for the European City of Culture. Without expressing any preference between the different British cities on that shortlist, clearly winning the title will bring very considerable economic advantages to the region in which the city is located.
<P>

<a name="30123-12_para3"></a>As to broadband, there are problems in rural areas. But the Government's commitment to installing broadband in every school, for example, applies to the North East as well as to everywhere else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Elliott of Morpeth: </B>   My Lords, many of us can remember the unemployment rate being very much higher in the North East than that which the Minister <P>


<a name="column_885"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 885</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has rightly quoted today. Will he commend the North East for being the first of two regions of the country to introduce the venture capital fund? This fund releases capital to medium and small businesses in the region provided that they have good ideas. It allows them to expand, develop and create more employment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew20"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware of the work which the noble Lord, Lord Elliott, has done over many years in this area for his native North East and I pay tribute to it. He is right about venture capital. I could also refer to the Regional Centre for Manufacturing Excellence, which, again, is one of only two and is already starting to do excellent work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </B>   My Lords, manufacturing accounts for 60 per cent of this country's exports and employs 4 million people&#151;about 20 per cent of the workforce. Does it remain the Government's policy that manufacturing is of critical importance to our economy? Will the Government encourage, in particular, investment in the sunrise industries that can harness and use new technologies to safeguard and expand the number of jobs in manufacturing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-12_spnew22"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I can certainly give that assurance. We give heavy priority to manufacturing industry, which is particularly important for the North East, where 5,000 enterprises employ 150,000 people. It employs 21 per cent of the area's workforce and accounts for 28 per cent of its GDP.
<P>

<a name="30123-12_para4"></a>There have been many recent successes in attracting sunrise enterprises to the North East. The trouble is that they have been accompanied by losses from the North East&#151;as from other parts of the country&#151;to manufacturing in eastern Europe and the Far East. It is a continuing battle.

<A NAME="30123-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the Minister is aware that the North East has many good universities. Is he also aware that many graduates travel to the hotspots in the South East and the South of England and do not remain behind to build up a broader base of industry in the North East? What can the Government do to assist?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the answer is that they should not travel to the South. The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, is right: the universities in the North East can contribute a great deal and can be very attractive to undergraduates.

<a name="30123-13_para0"></a>My noble friend Lord Sainsbury of Turville has been very active, as Science Minister, in encouraging collaboration between industry and academia through the science and industry councils in the North East. For example, there is the University Innovation Centre for Nanotechnology, which was set up in the North East and designed specifically for that purpose. I hope that that and other similar ventures will go a considerable way to answering the problem identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock.

<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What criteria will be used to determine whether universities will be allowed to charge top-up fees.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, before universities are given freedom to raise tuition fees, they must demonstrate that they will safeguard access. Universities will not be allowed to increase tuition fees until an access agreement has been agreed with the new access regulator, including targets that the universities will set for themselves. Universities will be able to vary fees downwards without conditions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply. Yesterday, she said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would be completely wrong for the regulator to be considering the detail".&#151;[Official Report, 22/1/03; col. 717.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-13_para1"></a>
If that is the case, how on earth can the regulator possibly do the job?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I stand by exactly what I said yesterday. We do not expect the regulator to be involved in the detail of individual admissions&#151;for example, as I said yesterday, by sitting in on interviews or doing anything of that nature.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para2"></a>Access agreements might include details of how the university was helping&#151;through link schemes, for example&#151;to target people in schools who might not otherwise aspire to go to university. There might also be details of a university's bursary schemes or summer schools and of the admissions process. Those are exactly the things that the regulator will look for.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend recall the Answer that she gave to my Starred Question on 24th July, 2001? She twice paid tribute to the access policies of Oxford University and, in response to other noble Lords, of other universities too. Is her view of the Oxford admission scheme the same now as it was then? Does she remain committed to the principle that world-class research-based universities are essential in our country? In that context, academic excellence is of paramount importance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I remember the Answer intimately. I pay tribute to all universities, <P>


<a name="column_887"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 887</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>including Oxford, for their excellent work in broadening access. We hope and trust that the regulator will assist in that process, not least because it will provide an opportunity for an independent person working within the Higher Education Funding Council for England to point to the tremendous work that the universities do. The universities may find that of value, as they seek to demonstrate that they want the best students.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para3"></a>I hope that, as my noble friend and others consider the White Paper in more detail, they will see the emphasis that we put on world-class research and the way in which we strive to make sure that we have world-class research and to recognise the universities that are already at that level.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us why it is thought necessary to have a regulator for access, given that any self-respecting university already has an access policy and that such policies are monitored by the HEFCE? When KPMG examined the costs of the existing regulation of universities, they found that it was disproportionate to the benefits yielded. Is this not another case of over-regulation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, as I have said and as is set out in the White Paper, the regulator will be based in HEFCE and will use its information and systems. There will not be another bureaucracy built around the regulator. The regulator will, of course, be independent, but we are keen to ensure that we work within a system that already exists.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para4"></a>The reasons should be evident to the noble Baroness. Many noble Lords will be aware that, as we move to a new situation, in which we allow differential fees in universities, there is great concern to ensure that the impact of those differential fees is not felt by students who come from the poorest backgrounds. The combination of allowing people to pay off their loan and pay their fees at the end of their course and ensuring that universities work hard to maintain or improve their record on access is necessary if the policy is to be successful, as, I know, the universities wish it to be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Baroness tell us the position with regard to fees in the major European universities? Do they have a method of financing comparable to top-up fees?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I cannot answer the noble and learned Lord's question at this stage. I shall write to him to give him the details.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, yesterday, the noble Baroness said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are in discussion with our colleagues in Scotland to ensure that we have an appropriate system".&#151;[Official Report, 22/1/03; col. 713.]

<FONT SIZE=3>
What does that mean? I have a second question. By definition, a regulator must regulate. What powers will the regulator have to regulate?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, we have discussed with our colleagues in Scotland the implications of increasing the threshold from 10,000 to 15,000. It will apply in Scotland, as Inland Revenue rules are applicable. We have ensured that that has been discussed, understood and recognised by our colleagues in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para6"></a>As we move forward, our colleagues in Scotland will be interested to see the impact on universities in Scotland or on Scottish students coming to universities in England. As noble Lords would expect, that dialogue continues. I hope that that clarifies the position for the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para7"></a>As is set out in the White Paper, the regulator will have the power to impose fines on universities that do not follow their access agreement or do not have an access agreement. The regulator will also have the power to require universities to reduce their fees to the standard rate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, has not the time come for the Government to loosen, not increase, their regulatory authority over universities? Does the Minister agree that one way would be for the Government to decide how much they can afford to pay for each university student&#151;including extra payments for those from disadvantaged backgrounds&#151;then allow universities to compete for students in the marketplace?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-13_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness will not be surprised to hear that in the course of the 18 months that the Government have deliberated on the matter, every possible avenue has been explored in determining how best to put together a system that does what we want. I will rehearse that we want a world-class university system properly funded, with contributions from those who benefit&#151;including the Government on behalf of the nation. We believe that we have found the right balance.

 "APPOINTMENTS TO THE POLICE SERVICE OF NORTHERN IRELAND
<br>
(1) The Secretary of State may, at the request of a majority of the Policing Board, and acting on the recommendation of the Chief Constable, by order&#151;
<br>
(a) suspend the provisions of section 46 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 (c. 32) for a maximum period of six months; and

(b) permit the Chief Constable to appoint to the Police Service of Northern Ireland persons from other constabularies within the United Kingdom as he deems appropriate.
<br>
(2) An order may not be made under this section unless a draft of that order has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, both Houses of Parliament."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-13_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a continuation of our previous debate. My party supports Patten and, at this stage, the 50:50 recruitment regulations. I am optimistic about them in one way because essentially they are only temporary in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. But I disagree with the noble and learned Lord in his optimism about the way that recruitment is going.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para11"></a>I apologise for the late tabling of the amendment, which is the result of a political visit&#151;as opposed to one of my normal weekend visits&#151;to Northern Ireland at the beginning of this week. From my discussions with various people, there is clearly a recruitment problem within the Police Service of Northern Ireland. It is short of personnel in specific areas and there are gaps in knowledge, experience and numbers of people.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para12"></a>I confess that the amendment is not absolutely to my liking and could be improved but its purpose is to tease out some ideas for alleviating the recruitment problem. One could say that the root cause is 50:50 but I choose not to do so. I say that it is Sinn Fein/IRA. There are plenty of Roman Catholics and nationalists in Northern Ireland who are dying to join the police force&#151;good, competent and honest people whom we and the Chief Constable, I am sure, would much like to have within the PSNI. However, intimidation is widespread. Although the Catholic Church and the SDLP have put their names to the PSNI and have joined, the others have not. While the others continue not to join and to intimidate, life is made extraordinarily difficult for the recruiters. The net result is that recruitment to the PSNI has been hijacked by Sinn Fein's threats, intimidation and refusal to play the game and join the team.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para13"></a>The amendment tackles the numbers head on, in terms of both clerical and uniformed personnel, so that the proportion of uniformed officers having to work in secretarial roles can be significantly reduced and the Chief Constable may be permitted to appoint persons from other constabularies within the UK as he deems appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para14"></a>I understand that a large number of men and women from Northern Ireland are serving in police forces elsewhere in the UK but cannot automatically be recruited and given places within the PSNI. Most would have to go through the training centre at Garnerville. If one has been on the beat for seven or 10 years and is experienced, one would not expect a return to basic training because of changing forces. That does not seem logical.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para15"></a>Anyone who has visited Garnerville will know that as a training centre for a brand-new, growing police force, it is awful. It is not dirty or rundown, but it is too small and inadequate. The accommodation for trainees is terrible&#151;tiny rooms for two people in which at best one of them can sit and work but the other cannot. The <P>


<a name="column_890"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 890</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>facilities are not exciting or attractive and would not make me feel good if Garnerville were my first impression of PSNI training. It may be a side issue but Garnerville seriously shocked me.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para16"></a>We must find a means as soon as possible of loosening the grip that Sinn Fein intimidation has on PSNI recruitment. I suggest that the provision of the 2000 Act initially be suspended for only six months so that a door can be opened when the Chief Constable and his team have their backs to the wall, with not enough officers on the streets. Because the force is overworked and overstretched, morale suffers, absenteeism increases and one starts on a wheel that we have all encountered at some stage in our lives, in one form of business or another.
<P>

<a name="30123-13_para17"></a>Despite the politics, which I understand clearly, the Government must find a way to alleviate the problem. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I support 50:50 entry to the police service, or at least some proportion close to it, which is necessary in view of northern Irish history and in particular of the disputes in the past over policing. It is also necessary to bridge the Protestant-Roman Catholic divide, which is still very real despite much valiant inter-Church and ecumenical work.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para0"></a>I am less happy about the way in which the principle has been put into practice. Section 46(1) of the 2000 Act was badly drafted. It states that half shall be persons who are deemed to be Roman Catholic and half shall be others. I cannot see why atheists, agnostics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus and members of other minority religions should be deemed to be Protestants. As many as 15 per cent of the whole population may be agnostic, non-believing or adherents to minority faiths. Surely such people can be trusted to act impartially as between Protestants and Catholics, since by definition they do not share their convictions.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para1"></a>I therefore suggest that there is much scope for new thinking on how the 50:50 principle should be applied. Will the Secretary of State vary the ratios in some helpful way? As I said at Second Reading, I am very concerned at the overall shortage of police officers, especially detectives and other ranks, and the shortage of officers to provide cover at night. The recruitment of civilians and the new police support staff may, and I hope will, do something to relieve the situation.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para2"></a>I was glad to hear of the campaigns that the recruitment consultants are now running. I should like to propose that police volunteers to serve in Northern Ireland, coming from Britain and the Commonwealth, should be treated as additional to 50:50 local recruitment. Their education, training and previous service make them fully aware of the need for total impartiality. They should be free from sectarian suspicion. The Chief Constable has told me that he advertises twice a year to attract British and Commonwealth applicants. Is that enough? I should like to see an appeal made to the heads of British and Commonwealth police services to second some of their best and most experienced officers.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30123-14_para3"></a>In my view, on those grounds, Amendment No. 29A is not geographically, sufficiently widely drawn. Surely the United States of America should also be included in both advertisements and appeals. That country has been generous to Northern Ireland by providing the services of the former Senator Mitchell and by arranging sundry presidential visits. I should have thought that the USA could afford to spare a few police officers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, I said this morning that I was asking a stand-alone question. The question that I ask now is a stand-alone question also. It is tangential to my noble friend's amendment. I shall understand if the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal says that he would like to write to me.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para4"></a>About a year ago, the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and I, under the auspices of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, had the opportunity of talking to the recruits at Garnerville in one of the earliest cohorts. One of the concerns that arose&#151;I return to what my noble friend said about Sinn Fein pressure&#151;was that recruits were being told specifically where they were going to go and where they were going to serve. They had some opportunity for consultation but, ultimately, it was going to be an order that they might have to go to an area which might not be ideal in terms of their own particular background.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para5"></a>We raised that same matter with the Policing Board in the afternoon and the Policing Board knew nothing of it and, initially, was disturbed. The nature of my question is whether, during the course of the past year, that problem has been solved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I have some sympathy with Amendment No. 10 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and his noble friends. I see the danger as enunciated by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. What is being attempted in order to resolve a short-term problem will not, in effect, resolve the underlying problem that exists within Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para6"></a>I may be guilty of going back too far in history, but perhaps I may remind your Lordships of the situation in the early 1970s when the Army was brought into Northern Ireland to resolve a problem. The Army was welcomed with open arms right across the community. It appeared to be that dodging the issue at home and bringing in the Army from Great Britain was to be the answer at that time. That did not last. One cannot, and should not, discount the nature of terrorism when endeavouring to resolve a problem in the short-term.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para7"></a>In effect, it was a very short period before the Army&#151; who were initially being given cups of tea and had been welcomed at doors throughout both areas of Belfast and elsewhere&#151;were being shot at and were being seen as legitimate targets because they underpinned, and were seen to underpin, the Britishness of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para8"></a>I have some sympathy with the amendment, but I fear that, ultimately, the same situation would arise. Those who are brought in, for the best of reasons, would be seen as sustaining something that terrorist elements oppose. Hence, they would become targets.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para9"></a>I do not know the answer; I wish I could tell your Lordships what the alternative is. I do not know what it is. But I simply urge caution in terms of short-term measures that may not actually tackle the underlying problem that we must face.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-14_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, I, too, have sympathy with Amendment No. 10. For once, I am delighted to say that I am entirely in favour of what the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, and thank him for his support.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para10"></a>We need help in recruiting policemen. I feel that the Government do not do everything in their power to help to resolve the situation in the short-term, although there are long-term aims. When we talk of lateral entry from other forces, there is no question but that certain issues could be eased. It is also true that a policeman from the Wild West of America cannot go into West Belfast and be a policeman there. One accepts that.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para11"></a>However, there must be a point at which a certain amount of police training is common to virtually all police forces. There would also be a certain amount of training that was simply either inappropriate or had to be re-run in the context of Northern Ireland. Although the Government may say that they could do something, I should like to see some action. We need measures that will provide properly qualified policemen.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, mentioned the training college at Garnerville, where new recruits may have to attend for a time. Lateral entry is perhaps for the more mature person who is a policeman already, as opposed to a raw recruit. Therefore, he may be married; he may be a family man; he may be 35 years-old; he may be even older. Garnerville is an absolute disgrace. On one occasion a mother of three had to go into one of these almost cell-like rooms in Garnerville, where she had to clean the floor and was given virtually no implements. Your Lordships may say that I am on the Policing Board and am therefore responsible for that. I shall turn to that point in a moment. The woman had to try to lift the dust with sellotape. "Degrading" is not the word for it.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para13"></a>It is not the Policing Board's fault. We are doing what we can. The Oversight Commissioner pointed out in his last report that the Government have done nothing about Garnerville in three and a half years. Proposals were put forward when the Policing Board was first set-up. The Government have side-stepped them in every way possible. The Maze prison site may be used for new facilities, and there are arguments for and against. But that has happened throughout. Perhaps the Maze site is inappropriate for this college.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para14"></a>However, the Government side-stepped the issue at first and said that the task had been given to the Executive. They said that they could do nothing. But as they have a responsibility for security, what would they do if, having given it to the Executive, they had then to get it back? That would be rather unusual.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para15"></a>However, as the Assembly is not operating at the moment the Government own the premises again. If they had wanted to, they could have done something <P>


<a name="column_893"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 893</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about it and brought a proposal before Parliament, if that were necessary. They did absolutely nothing. It is a disgrace, and the Oversight Commissioner is fully aware of it. So is everyone else. We have been badly let down.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para16"></a>The Minister will tell us that a committee is trying to resolve the issue. The Oversight Commissioner says that the college cannot be in place for another three and a half years. It was a major item in the Patten report and so far as the Oversight Commissioner was concerned. If Patten is always right, why have the Government not provided the facility?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend Lord Hylton about the possible merits of recruiting people from the British mainland. However, I would totally oppose recruiting anyone from the United States, given the widespread support for militant republicanism in that country until recently. Furthermore, there is an amazing ignorance of the Province among Americans, even the most highly educated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, in so far as I can, I shall try to confine myself to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. It is not correct that nothing has been done by the Government about Garnerville. I accept that there are significant considerable deficiencies there. We have made 2 million available for new works and the refurbishment of existing facilities and we remain committed to the Patten recommendations for a new police college.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para17"></a>As I see it, there are two elements in the noble Lord's amendments. He says candidly that he recognises that the drafting may not be perfect. The first element is suspension of the 50:50 recruitment provisions. That is not going to help in the context of what he described as gaps in skill and experience because 50:50 refers to new entrants.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para18"></a>I remind your Lordships that the Chief Constable already has the power to appoint officers of any rank, from sergeant to chief superintendent, from Great Britain constabularies. He already has that power. He does not have the power in regard to constables and I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. However, I understand that the Policing Board has already queried with the Chief Constable the scope for reducing the full period of training for experienced constables who join on a 50:50 basis. If the Chief Constable and the board want to put forward a proposal, certainly the Government would give it careful consideration and we can make a change through the regulations, not through the Act.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para19"></a>We have met the 50:50 target for police trainees&#151;I gave the figures before lunch&#151;and we have met the 50:50 target for police support staff appointments since September last year. As I say, we are always willing to be as flexible as possible within the parameters of the policy principles we have adopted.

<P>

<a name="30123-14_para20"></a>As regards other secondments, it is possible under Section 98 of the Police Act 1996 to allow for secondment at all ranks from UK forces. I understand the concerns, but I do not believe that this is the mechanism to deal with them.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked about atheists and others. At paragraph 15.10, the Patten report specifically recommended that recruitment be 50 per cent Catholic and 50 per cent Protestant or undetermined.
<P>

<a name="30123-14_para22"></a>I agree with what the noble Lords, Lord Maginnis and Lord Glentoran, said about intimidation and the Patten report makes some strong comments on that. The Unionists and the SDLP have delivered in that regard and I repeat, as I have on so many other occasions, that it is for Sinn Fein also to join with the Roman Catholic hierarchy and encourage Roman Catholics generally to join the police force and serve the public in that way.
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-15_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 31 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 32. The purpose of the first amendment resonates with what many noble Lords have said about the difficulties that the 50:50 recruitment process creates. We are all committed to it but we need to look at it fairly regularly in order to see whether and how it is operating. That is why we suggest an opportunity to monitor the situation and to discuss it annually instead of every three years, as provided in the original Act of 2000.

<a name="30123-15_para5"></a>Amendment No. 32 is tabled in order to give a designated end date so that all parties&#151;not only political parties but also the agencies which are <P>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column 895</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concerned with policing in Northern Ireland&#151;have a fixed point beyond which, one hopes, it will not be necessary to extend the provision. The Patten report suggested that it should be for only eight years. Our amendment suggests 10 years, two more than envisaged by Patten. We are trying to reflect the report's original intention of ending the provision completely after 10 years because if, in the ninth year, it were extended by another three years it could roll on. We want to give a signal to all those people concerned with policing in Northern Ireland that it should definitely stop after 10 years. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I supported the first part of the amendment in Grand Committee. I see no reason to change my mind. It seems a sensible and useful amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I sympathise with the motives and thinking which lie behind the amendments. There is already a good deal of flexibility. I remind the House that the first review will occur in the earlier part of 2004, so we are not far away.
<P>

<a name="30123-15_para6"></a>In Grand Committee, I said that an annual review would be cumbersome. I shall develop the reasons. The time it takes for applications to be made and recruitment to follow has been halved from the year or so it took pre-Patten to about six months. But that is only before recruits enter training. They spend 20 weeks at the foundation faculty obtaining an accredited qualification; they have another two months training in other policing skills; and they spend about 18 further months as probationer constables. Perhaps I put it clumsily, but in management terms a review every year could not work. Those figures underline the fact that having a review after not longer than three years&#151;that is within the Secretary of State's power&#151;is about right.
<P>

<a name="30123-15_para7"></a>We have had success. In each of the first four campaigns the applicants&#151;I round up the figures&#151;numbered 7,500, 4,900, 4,700 and 4,300. The levels of Roman Catholic applications are 35 per cent, 39 per cent, 35 per cent and 35 per cent. I believe that it would be ill-advised to tinker too much at this stage. I stress that the review must take place in not more than three years but the Secretary of State can have a review sooner than that.
<P>

<a name="30123-15_para8"></a>In paragraph 15.10 of the report, Patten states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We believe that the ratio of recruits should be kept to 50:50, at least for the ten years of the model".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-15_para9"></a>
Therefore, I repeat that I do sympathise with what the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, has said, but at this stage, we ought to leave things as they are.
<P>

<a name="30123-15_para10"></a>I can say, however, that when it comes to the review, I shall ensure&#151;it may be a false assumption that I will still be doing this job&#151;that there is ample time to look at these issues, which are intricate and important.

<P>

This is a substantial group of amendments, which have been designed to improve the wording of the Bill. The police have requested amendments to enable them to enter into contracts with the private sector for the provision of services relating to the detention or escort of persons who have been arrested or are otherwise in custody. The Chief Constable may then designate any person who is an employee of the contractor, either as a detention officer or an escort officer. Therefore, the amendments are in line with Section 39 of the Police Reform Act 2002.
<P>

<a name="30123-15_para18"></a>I repeat that this provision comes at the request of the Chief Constable. It will allow him to take forward proposals for greater civilianisation in the police service.

<a name="30123-15_para21"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we are back to words again. Clause 20 suggests that there should be some training for people who are police support staff. Subsection (2)(c) states that,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-15_para22"></a>
The amendment would delete the word "adequate" and insert the word "full". There is a sense in which the word "adequate" is inadequate. The word is often prefaced by the word "barely", and barely adequate is certainly not correct.
<P>

<a name="30123-15_para23"></a>When we considered the matter in Committee, the noble and learned Lord suggested that the provision should be that the person had received the "appropriate" training, which would be a better word.

That would be far more appropriate and would give confidence that members of the police support staff are fully trained to do the work. I beg to move.

 "POLICE POWERS FOR DESIGNATED CONTRACTED-OUT STAFF

(1) This section applies if the Board has entered into a contract with a person ("the contractor") for the provision of services relating to the detention or escort of persons who have been arrested or are otherwise in custody.
<br>
(2) The Chief Constable may designate an employee of the contractor as an officer of either or both of these descriptions&#151;
<br>
(a) detention officer;
<br>
(b) escort officer.
<br>
(3) The Chief Constable may designate a person under this section only if he is satisfied that these requirements are met&#151;
<br>
(a) the person is a suitable person to carry out the functions for the purposes of which he is to be designated;
<br>
(b) the person is capable of effectively carrying out those functions;
<br>
(c) the person has received adequate training in the carrying out of those functions and in the exercise of the powers and performance of the duties to be conferred or imposed on him by his designation;
<br>
(d) the contractor is a fit and proper person to supervise the carrying out of the functions for the purposes of which the person is to be designated.
<br>
(4) A person designated under this section has&#151;
<br>
(a) the powers conferred on him by his designation;
<br>
(b) the duties imposed on him by his designation.
<br>
(5) A designation under this section may confer powers or impose duties on a person only by applying the powers or duties to him.
<br>
(6) The powers and duties that may be applied to a person designated under this section by his designation are any or all of those specified in the applicable Part of Schedule 1.
<br>
(7) The applicable Part of Schedule 1 is&#151;
<br>
(a) Part 2, in the case of a person designated under this section as a detention officer;
<br>
(b) Part 3, in the case of a person designated under this section as an escort officer.
<br>
(8) If a power is conferred or a duty imposed on a person designated under this section by his designation&#151;
<br>
(a) the power or duty does not authorise or require him to engage in any conduct otherwise than in the course of his employment as an employee of the contractor;
<br>
(b) the power may be conferred or the duty imposed subject to restrictions or conditions specified in the designation.
<br>
(9) Subsection (10) applies in relation to the exercise of a power by a person designated under this section in reliance on his designation if the power is one which, if exercised by a police officer, includes or is supplemented by a power to use reasonable force.

<br>
(11) A designation under this section, unless it is previously withdrawn or ceases to have effect under subsection (12), shall remain in force for such period as may be specified in the designation; but it may be renewed at any time with effect from the time when it would otherwise expire.
<br>
(12) A designation under this section shall cease to have effect&#151;
<br>
(a) if the designated person ceases to be an employee of the contractor; or

 "DESIGNATIONS: SUPPLEMENTARY
<br>
(1) Subsection (2) applies if, in reliance on his designation under section 20 or (Police powers for designated contracted-out staff), a person exercises or performs a power or duty in relation to another or purports to do so.
<br>
(2) The designated person must produce his designation to the other if requested to do so.
<br>
(3) A failure to comply with subsection (2) does not make the exercise or performance of the power or duty invalid.
<br>
(4) The Chief Constable may at any time modify or withdraw a person's designation under section 20 or (Police powers for designated contracted-out staff) by notice to him.
<br>
(5) If the Chief Constable modifies or withdraws a person's designation under section (Police powers for designated contracted-out staff), he must send a copy of the notice of the modification or withdrawal to the contractor responsible for supervising the designated person in the carrying out of the functions for the purposes of which the designation was granted.
<br>
(6) In subsection (5) "contractor" means a person who has entered into a contract with the Board such as is mentioned in section (Police powers for designated contracted-out staff) (1)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-17_para8"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 74 is to include the new clause as printed on the Marshalled List.

 "COMPLAINTS AND MISCONDUCT
<br>
(1) The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for the handling of&#151;
<br>
(a) complaints relating to the carrying out by a person designated under section 20 or (Police powers for designated contracted-out staff) of any of the functions mentioned in subsection (2);
<br>
(b) instances of misconduct involving the carrying out by such a person of any of those functions.
<br>
(2) The functions are those for the purposes of which any power or duty is conferred or imposed on the person by his designation.
<br>
(3) Regulations under subsection (1) may in particular provide that any provision of Part 7 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (c. 32) is to apply, with such modifications as may be prescribed by the regulations, with respect to persons designated under section 20 or (Police powers for designated contracted-out staff).
<br>
(4) Before making regulations under subsection (1), the Secretary of State must consult&#151;
<br>
(a) the Ombudsman;
<br>
(b) the Board;
<br>
(c) the Chief Constable;
<br>
(d) the Police Association;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-17_para13"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, after Clause 21 I propose the insertion of this new clause. This is to give the ombudsman power to deal from commencement with complaints against designated civilians, including contracted-out staff, given that they will be exercising limited police powers as outlined in Schedule 1 to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30123-17_para14"></a>At present, in England and Wales complaints against police authority employed support staff are handled at the discretion of chief officers, but when the new complaints system comes into force on 1st April 2004 all police authority employees will have an extended complaints regime.
<P>

<a name="30123-17_para15"></a>We do not at present see the case for further extending the ombudsman's remit for investigating complaints against civilians employed by the Chief Constable beyond those of designated powers, as to the reason I have given. They will be exercising limited police powers and, therefore, should fall appropriately within the ombudsman's remit. I beg to move.

 "LIABILITY FOR UNLAWFUL CONDUCT
<br>
(1) For the purposes of determining liability for the unlawful conduct of employees of the Board, conduct by an employee of the Board in reliance or purported reliance on a designation under section 20 must be taken to be conduct in the course of his employment by the Board; and, in the case of a tort, the Board accordingly falls to be treated as a joint tortfeasor.
<br>
(2) For the purposes of determining liability for the unlawful conduct of persons employed in the civil service, conduct by such a person in reliance or purported reliance on a designation under section 20 must be taken to be conduct in the course of his employment in the civil service; and, in the case of a tort, the Department of Finance and Personnel accordingly falls to be treated as a joint tortfeasor.
<br>
(3) For the purposes of determining liability for the unlawful conduct of employees of a contractor, conduct by such an employee in reliance or purported reliance on a designation under section (Police powers for designated contracted-out staff) must be taken to be conduct in the course of his employment by the contractor; and, in the case of a tort, the contractor accordingly falls to be treated as a joint tortfeasor.

<a name="30123-18_para33"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I apologise for the late tabling of this amendment. Throughout the Grand Committee debates, I frequently referred to the appropriateness of the timing of various matters in the Bill. I know that the amendment's wording is not quite right. When we took it to the Clerks' Department, they told us that it was not acceptable in its present format and there was some rather hasty editing. I wanted the date of the commencement of the Bill to be debated.
<P>

<a name="30123-18_para34"></a>Throughout our consideration of the Bill, I have made it clear that I disagree with the Government on timing. With the decommissioning process incomplete, we should like Section 3 of the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act 1997 satisfied and verified by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning before any of the provisions come into force. With half the executive still not behind the Policing Board, I am disinclined to push through more technical legislation on policing. The bottom line is that we are, as I have said earlier, putting the people of Northern Ireland at risk by taking <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-18_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 35:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 7, line 14, after "State" insert "within 14 working days"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-18_para39"></a><P>

<a name="30123-18_para40"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment, which stands in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, is a probing amendment&#151;the fact that we are in Grand Committee means that amendments can be nothing else. However, as was apparent in our previous sitting, if we had considered such amendments on the Floor of the House, they would still have remained only probing amendments. Most but not all of the amendments that we shall consider today will be probing amendments.
<P>

<a name="30123-18_para41"></a>The amendment would establish a timetable for the forwarding of freezing orders. The amendment is intended to probe the level of staffing at the Central Authority that the Government are putting in place to ensure that the authority will be able to respond with due expedition to requests made under the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30123-18_para42"></a>Can the noble and learned Lord the Minister give the Committee an idea of what the current level of staffing is at the Central Authority? In particular, how many qualified lawyers are there on the staff? Will he confirm that some, if not all, of the incoming requests involve the Home Office reaching a decision on law rather than on procedure? Will the Minister assist the Committee by giving us an idea of how many applications for judicial review over the past two years were dealt with by staff at the Central Authority? How much of their time was taken up in such work?
<P>

<a name="30123-18_para43"></a>We are trying to secure a picture of what the Central Authority staffing currently is and whether the Government are satisfied that that level of staffing is sufficient to do the extra work that will be involved as a result of the Bill; if not, what are their plans?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I am rather concerned that the amendment is not practical, because the system that we envisage is completely new. It is important that the Attorney-General, who I believe will respond to this amendment, should indicate within what time the <P>


<a name="column_GC62"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>department will be able to deal with the issue. Currently, as I understand it, the situation is completely open. That is not satisfactory from the point of view of the department or of those who invigilate the department. My noble and learned friend should consider a practical amendment; I am not sure whether a period of 14 days&#151;which is seemingly plucked out of the air&#151;is altogether right. There should be some time limit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I agree that there must be a time limit of some kind. It is notorious that legal proceedings and more especially civil actions in this country, as in most other countries, can stretch on for months and years if we are not careful. These long and important proceedings, which should be brought to a head without much delay, should be subject to some kind of time limit. It could be said that 14 days is rather pressing the matter but I do not believe that to be unreasonable. If the Attorney-General says that he accepts the principle but would like to reconsider the length of time, one would have to consider that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   The amendment stands also in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Dholakia. I obviously support it and have nothing to add to the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spmin0"></A><B>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </B>  I shall respond as best I can to the questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, about the level of staffing at the Central Authority. I am grateful to those who provided this information. I do not complain that I did not have notice; I say that simply by way of explanation. If there is some detail that the noble Baroness requires that I cannot give now, she will no doubt let us know and we shall do our best to respond in writing.
<P>

<a name="30123-19_para0"></a>The Central Authority is currently staffed with one lawyer at its head, an SEO deputy, a higher executive officer and 10 operational staff. It also has the ability to call on the legal advisers branch at the Home Office, which would be a source of additional legal advice should that be necessary. The noble Baroness asked about the challenges by way of judicial review. They have been minimal&#151;one last year and two the previous year.
<P>

<a name="30123-19_para1"></a>The Bill will result in some decrease in the work of the Central Authority because, as the Committee will have noted, in certain cases&#151;this is an important point&#151;it is intended that there will be direct transmission of the material or request so that they do not have to pass through the Central Authority; that will speed things up. However, there will also be some increases. If it is helpful to provide further detail, I hope that the noble Baroness will not hesitate to ask and we shall do the best that we can.
<P>

<a name="30123-19_para2"></a>The amendment proposes that a domestic freezing order must be sent to the Secretary of State in order to be transmitted abroad within 14 days of being made. All Members of the Committee who have spoken&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Clinton-Davis, Lord Renton and Lord Goodhart, and the noble Baroness&#151;have invited consideration of whether some kind of time limit <P>


<a name="column_GC63"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be put on that obligation. I accede to that invitation to consider the issue. The Government agree that these are cases in which the order should be executed as quickly as possible after it has been made.
<P>

<a name="30123-19_para3"></a>Members of the Committee may know that there are time limits within which domestic search warrants must be executed. We cannot impose the same time limit in relation to the sending of the orders because we shall not have control over the overseas authority that will execute the orders. However, the idea that there should be some degree of urgency&#151;a similar degree of urgency if not precisely the same&#151;raises a very fair point. While I sympathise with the intention that lies behind the amendment, we should like to take the precise terms and the drafting away for further consideration. I hope that Members of the Committee find that a helpful response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Will the noble and learned Lord also consider the length of the time limit? I hope that there will be one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   Absolutely. We are sympathetic to the idea that there should be a time limit. We shall consider that point, and the drafting, and bring back a proposal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Has the noble and learned Lord consulted the Lord Advocate on this matter? Would it be his intention to accede on behalf of the Lord Advocate? How will he proceed? If this approach is necessary south of the Border, it is probably also necessary in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   As always, the noble Baroness is right to make these points. I shall take that issue away as well and, if it is necessary to consult the Lord Advocate, that will be done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   The noble Baroness asked about resources and the noble and learned Lord indicated the present staffing level of the unit. Bearing in mind the additional workload, has he given any consideration to the extent to which additional staffing may be required, and will be made available in dealing with such orders?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   I gave an indication of the current staffing level and said that the Bill will result in a decrease in work in some areas, but also in some increases. The resources are currently considered to be adequate. All targets are currently being met and the position will doubtless be kept under review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who took part in this short debate and who supported the principle of including an indication of urgency. I am particularly grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Minister for agreeing to take the matter away for consideration as regards the drafting, and for the possibility, as my noble friend Lord Renton said, of introducing some kind of time limit.

<a name="30123-19_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, was absolutely right to say that the figure of 14 days had been plucked out of the air. It was merely a tool to enable a proper debate on these matters of urgency. If they are not properly dealt with, the system will not have the credibility that it deserves in the eyes of people in this country and overseas. It is with pleasure that I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30123-19_para5"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="30123-19_para6"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 11 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I am not sure whether I am the only Member of the Committee who experiences considerable confusion in following the various clauses involving the differences between requests for evidence freezing orders, as against responding to or receiving them.
<P>

<a name="30123-19_para7"></a>As I understand it, in this clause we are dealing with sending abroad a domestic freezing order made by a court in this country. Clause 10 suggests that the freezing order should be made by a judicial authority&#151;in general terms, a court having satisfied itself that it is necessary for the protection of the required evidence which is in another country. However, before the freezing order can be sent to the other country, it must first go to the Secretary of State for forwarding, who will then decide whether he can forward it to a court exercising jurisdiction in the place where the evidence is situated.
<P>

<a name="30123-19_para8"></a>If we compare that provision with Clauses 7 and 8, we find that, if the request is not for a freezing order but for assistance in obtaining the evidence, there is no need for the interference of the Secretary of State, and, as I understand it, the court&#151;the "judicial authority" referred to in Clause 7&#151;can send the request directly to the court where he believes the evidence is situated.
<P>

<a name="30123-19_para9"></a>Are we not in a slightly strange situation? We are requiring applications for freezing orders&#151;designed to freeze evidence to ensure that it is not destroyed&#151;to go through the Secretary of State; but in the case of a request to have the evidence sent to this country so that it can be used, it goes directly from one court to the other. Why, in Clause 11, it is necessary to involve the Secretary of State?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   Clause 11, as the noble Lord correctly identifies, requires freezing orders made by the domestic courts in this country to be sent via the Secretary of State, or in Scotland via the Lord Advocate. That is in contrast to the provision for direct transmission for letters of request under Clause 7.
<P>

<a name="30123-19_para10"></a>The reason for that, about which the noble Lord properly asks, is that the freezing orders are a new procedure. There are no current procedures for dealing with them. Therefore, those dealing with them will be unfamiliar with the issuing, sending and receiving of them. The decision has been made that in those circumstances they should be sent via the Secretary of State. That will have the advantage of enabling the orders to be monitored and to be checked to ensure that they comply with the requirements of <P>


<a name="column_GC65"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC65</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the framework directive and of the legislation, and it will ensure that they are responded to appropriately. The importance of being able to ensure that the orders are properly made and properly executed is of significant interest. It is that which justifies this different procedure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-19_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I thank the noble and learned Lord for giving way. I understand that a new procedure is being invoked. However, gradually, perhaps after two or three years or more, the situation will be ameliorated. People will become more aware of their responsibilities. Is there any procedure which the noble and learned Lord has in mind to ensure that in a reasonable period of time the whole situation will be considered?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030123/text/30123-20.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The noble Lord asks whether there is a procedure for ensuring that the whole situation will be considered within a reasonable time. Legislation of this kind and its operation is kept under review. If it does not work and does not produce benefits, that will become apparent to those who are operating it, to those who are trying to benefit from it and to Ministers. I cannot take the matter further at present. I have given the reasons for this different procedure being proposed in this specific area, which I understand, at least for the time being, the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, sees as understandable and reasonable. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his opposition to the Question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General for that explanation. As the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, stated, it seems a perfectly acceptable explanation in the early days of the freezing order. However, I hope that it shall not be continued as an unnecessary bureaucratic intervention once the freezing orders are recognised in the same way as other requests for evidence. The noble Lord asked how often such matters are reviewed. I suppose that the last action in this area was 1990. Perhaps in about 14 years' time someone may be around to delete the need in Clause 11 to go to the Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, why is he so impatient? He mentioned 14 years. We could make it 25 years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   As was mentioned in last night's debate in the House, it all depends on whether any of us will be here in 20 years.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para0"></a>Clause 11 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para1"></a>Clause 12 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para2"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 13 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   The same point arises. Clause 13 deals with requests from overseas for assistance by the courts in this country. Such requests must be received by the territorial authority for that part of the United Kingdom which is, by definition in <P>


<a name="column_GC66"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 28(9), the Secretary of State. Yet, under Clauses 7 and 8, if it is the other way round and the request comes from this country to another asking for its assistance in obtaining evidence, it can come directly from the judicial authority to the court in the country from which assistance is requested. Clause 8 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A request for assistance under section 7 may be sent&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-20_para3"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) to a court exercising jurisdiction in the place where the evidence is situated, or
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-20_para4"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) to any authority recognised by the government".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-20_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30123-20_para6"></a>Why must there be a system where a request from this country can go directly from the court to the court whereas a similar request from overseas cannot go directly to the court but to the Home Secretary who is required under Clause 15 to nominate a court to receive any such evidence? Perhaps I have misunderstood but it appears that in one way the court deals directly with the court yet an incoming request comes through the Secretary of State. I wondered why there is that difference.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The answer to the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, concerns the difference in the structure in the United Kingdom and that in other countries for how jurisdiction for prosecution is set out. At this end there are a number of different prosecuting authorities. The division between their jurisdiction is complex and based upon the type of crime involved. Therefore, it is much more difficult to identify who is necessarily the correct recipient for an incoming request. In that direction, it is appropriate that that should be assisted by coming through the territorial authority, and I shall return to what that means.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para7"></a>The advantage is that that will speed up the provision of assistance. It will mean that requests are directed to the correct place. We would not want, nor would the Committee, situations in which important requests from another country were misdirected to some part of the Crown Prosecution Service or to an inappropriate court in some part of the country. That could lead to great delay.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para8"></a>On the other hand, in many other countries the prosecution is based more on territorial division, and the investigation and prosecution stages may be more closely linked. That is why Clause 8 provides for the possibility of sending requests directly to the executing authority. However, notwithstanding that, there is an important speeding-up in the process.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para9"></a>Territorial authority, a concept to which the noble Lord rightly draws attention, includes the devolved administrations. The territorial authority is the Secretary of State in England and Wales but is the Lord Advocate in Scotland. Enabling the request to be sent directly to the devolved administration will remove an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. That geographical division is straightforward and easy to explain. The other territorial and functional divisions between courts and prosecuting authorities are more difficult to explain. I hope that that answers the question raised by the noble Lord. If it does, or <P>


<a name="column_GC67"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perhaps even if it does not, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his opposition to the Question whether the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I shall consider what has been said by the noble and learned Lord. The other matter I wish to raise concerns the happy phrase, "The administrative authority", which appears in Clause 1 but not in Clause 13. Clause 1 states that a request for an overseas process relates to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any document issued or made by an administrative authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-20_para10"></a>
Clause 13 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The request for assistance may be made only by&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-20_para11"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) a court exercising criminal jurisdiction . . .  in a country outside the United Kingdom, [or]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-20_para12"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) any other authority in such a country which appears to the territorial authority to have the function of making such requests for assistance".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-20_para13"></a>
Is that intended to include the administrative authority whose requests we can deal with in the service of overseas process? Why are the words different in the two clauses?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   Clause 1 deals with service of process, whereas Clause 13 deals with evidence, as does Clause 7. They are different concepts and different functions. I do not immediately follow why the noble Lord might think that the situation should be the same. It does not seem to me that it needs to be the same. In the different context of service of process as opposed to gathering of evidence, the provisions make sense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I think that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General is right about that. However, I still think the difference between Clause 13 and Clause 7 surprising so far as concerns the receipt for the request for evidence. It is difficult to see how adding in an extra stage&#151;namely, having to go to the territorial authority&#151;will save time. If we have enough confidence in the system in Clause 7 that requests to countries can go direct from our courts to their courts, we should enable them to be able to send requests directly to our courts rather than going through the Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   Perhaps I may remind the noble Lord that Clause 8 provides a choice. The request can be sent via an authority as well as being sent directly. I have done my best to answer the question raised by the noble Lord. I do not share his confidence that if we require incoming requests to be sent to wherever the overseas authority thought appropriate that would not give rise to delay and to a risk of requests being lost in the post.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para14"></a>In the United Kingdom there will be prosecutors who cannot execute requests. Therefore, it would be wrong for requests to be sent to them. It is much better, therefore, for requests to be sent to the Secretary of State who will obviously deal with them as expeditiously as possible and speed them on their way to the correct place.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para19"></a>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of that subsection refer to criminal proceedings and criminal investigations. Paragraph (c) is wider and refers to clemency proceedings, which I shall consider in a moment, and to proceedings on an appeal before a court against a decision in administrative proceedings. As was recalled by my noble friend Lord Carlisle, last week the Committee debated the question of administrative proceedings in relation to Clause 1. The reference to such proceedings in Clause 14 is to an appeal before a court against a decision made in administrative proceedings, whereas in other parts of the Bill&#151;such as Clause 1&#151;the administrative proceedings themselves are referred to.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para20"></a>I hope that the Minister can clarify why it has been decided to refer to an appeal before a court rather than to the administrative proceedings themselves.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para21"></a>Amendments Nos. 37 and 127 relate to the term "clemency proceedings", which is used in Clause 14 and elsewhere in the Bill. Specifically, they refer to the definition of such proceedings contained in Clause 52(1), which says that it means,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"proceedings in a country outside the United Kingdom, not being proceedings before a court exercising criminal jurisdiction, for the removal of a penalty imposed on conviction of an offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-20_para22"></a><P>

<a name="30123-20_para23"></a>Amendment No. 127 would amend that definition by changing the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"removal of a penalty",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-20_para24"></a>
to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"removal or reduction of a penalty".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-20_para25"></a>
It seeks to probe the precise nature of the definition. Do the words "removal of a penalty" cover the situation in which the power of clemency is exercised to commute a death sentence to a period of imprisonment? If one was being pedantic, one could say that that is not a penalty being removed because there would still be a penalty.
<P>

<a name="30123-20_para26"></a>I hope that the noble and learned Lord will also be able to explain whether the definition of clemency proceedings is intended to extend the scope of the Bill's provisions, not just to the death penalty case but to other cases in which the power of clemency is exercised, such as a reduction in the length of a prison <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>sentence. If that is the Government's intention, I may be pedantic about the use of the word "removed". I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30123-20_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I should have asked this question in relation to Clause 1. The words "clemency proceedings" are used only in relation to the Schengen convention, and not in any other instrument of law in this country. I may be entirely wrong about that, but I have never seen that expression before. Can my noble and learned friend say whether a similar provision has been included in any other legislation?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   I support what my noble friend Lady Anelay has said. In Clause 14, when dealing with proceedings in which the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"territorial authority may arrange for evidence to be obtained",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-21_para0"></a>
why under subsection (1)(c) should that be,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"on an appeal before a court against a decision in administrative proceedings, being carried on, or intended to be carried on"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-21_para1"></a>
Why should it not be an application that relates to the administrative proceedings themselves? I say that because "administrative proceedings" is defined in Clause 52 as applying to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"administrative authorities in respect of administrative offences where a decision in the proceedings may be the subject of an appeal before a court".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-21_para2"></a>
That may be a definition of the term "administrative proceedings", but proceedings themselves are taken before the administrative authority. When the Minister from the Home Office was replying to the question of what were the administrative offences before administrative authorities, he said they were,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a category of offence that does not exist in the UK but does exist in some of our partner countries. In some EU countries, for example, offences such as driving offences are dealt with in that way".&#151;[Official Report, 13/1/03; col. GC9.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-21_para3"></a>
Does that mean&#151;and if so why&#151;that one can make a request for evidence to this country if one wants to use it in an appeal&#151;presumably against a conviction for a driving offence, which has been carried out by an administrative authority&#151;in administrative proceedings, but one cannot respond to a request for the evidence if one wants it for the purpose of bringing the case and conducting the case before the administrative authority in the first place? I do not see why it is necessary to have the proviso that a decision in administrative proceedings must have an appeal before a court, either being carried on or intended to be carried on, when the application is made. It would be much more consistent with what we are told about Clause 1 that the application could be made in administrative proceedings&#151;those being proceedings which are in fact subject to an appeal&#151;should either party wish, but not that the appeal was a necessary prerequisite.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The amendments seek to amend in different ways the definitions of the type of proceedings where the United Kingdom would be able to provide mutual legal assistance. It might be helpful if I explain in a little more detail what paragraph (c) is designed to cover, why its inclusion is necessary and how this relates to the existing judicial co-operation, mutual legal assistance provisions in the 1990 Act.
<P>


<a name="column_GC70"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC70</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para4"></a>It is the case that&#151;and my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis alluded to this matter&#151;implementation of the judicial co-operation of Schengen requires us to be able to assist other Schengen countries in relation to two categories of case: administrative proceedings and, at least, certain types of clemency proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para5"></a>There has already been discussion in Committee about what "administrative proceedings" in this context means. They are not straightforward to identify and define because they do not have an exact counterpart in our own legal system. The example cited in the explanatory report to the Mutual Legal Assistance Convention is a German offence. That is an offence which, whilst not classified as a criminal offence, is punishable by a fine imposed by an administrative authority. It is known as ordnungswidrigkeit. However, there is a right of appeal to the ordinary criminal courts. It is intended to be an administrative proceeding where assistance might be sought.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para6"></a>An example was given by my noble friend Lord Filkin of traffic offences, which under Dutch law are administrative offences. In this country they would be classified as criminal offences, albeit at the lower end of the criminal scale. There has already been an offer to provide any further helpful information as a result of the requests made when the Committee last sat.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para7"></a>The term "clemency proceedings" is also difficult to define. It does not appear to us that there are domestic&#151;United Kingdom&#151;procedures that precisely fit that description either. Our European partners say that they have such procedures. They may in certain cases be analogous to appeal applications&#151;as we might call them&#151;which they describe as clemency proceedings. Under the Schengen Convention of 1995 we are required to provide assistance on that matter.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para8"></a>To delete subsection (1)(c), which Amendment No. 36 seeks, would render us unable to provide the assistance required by Schengen and the 2000 Convention.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para9"></a>Amendment No. 127 adds the words "or reduction" to the definition of the term "clemency proceedings". The noble Baroness said that it was a probing amendment. I go further: I think it is a good proposal that makes clear that clemency includes reduction as well as removal. I am happy to accept that amendment and to do so as it is drafted.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, asked a detailed question about how Clause 14(1)(c) operates and, in particular, the relationship between proceedings on an appeal against a decision in administrative proceedings and those proceedings themselves. We should look at that matter and study carefully whether his point is one that ought to be taken into account in the drafting. I propose that we should look at the issue and indicate, having done so, what stance should be taken.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para11"></a>Amendment No. 37 is not necessary, given that Clause 52 already defines clemency proceedings for the purposes of this part of the Bill.
<P>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para12"></a>Therefore, I invite the noble Baroness not to pursue Amendment No. 36, and I have indicated my attitude to Amendment No. 127 when it is formally moved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-21_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I want to make absolutely sure that I have understood the matter. According to Clause 52(1), the definition of "clemency proceedings" is the removal&#151;and or reduction&#151;of penalties for offences which were not tried as criminal charges, but are matters such as driving licence offences in other countries which are tried in a different court. That does not apply to criminal charges. Is that correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   I think not. They are two separate issues. The administrative proceedings are those which relate to an administrative offence, something which we might well regard as a criminal offence. It is tried as an administrative offence, but there is an appeal to a court and a penalty is imposed. Clemency proceedings are quite distinct. They are a form of procedure not known to us specifically, but which may well include what we might think of as an appeal for a reduction in a sentence which has been imposed on the conviction of a criminal offence. I do not know whether it is theoretically possible to have a clemency proceeding against the finding of guilt on an administrative offence. That is not the point. They are distinct issues.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para13"></a>In order to put the matter beyond doubt, if one goes to the definition in Clause 52(1), it says quite simply that clemency proceedings are proceedings,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for the removal [and or reduction] of a penalty imposed on conviction of an offence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-21_para14"></a>
I can reassure the noble Baroness that it includes only convictions of criminal offences.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-21_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I hesitate to query the noble and learned Lord, but the provision says that they are,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"proceedings . . . not being proceedings before a court exercising criminal jurisdiction".

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="30123-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before the noble and learned Lord replies to that, I feel obliged to mention that I have been listening with great interest but with some confusion to the issue. Certainly, in our country the phrase "clemency" is used only in relation to other criminal proceedings. But here it is suggested that clemency proceedings in a country outside the United Kingdom shall not relate to proceedings before a court exercising criminal jurisdiction&#151;exactly the opposite use of the word clemency. Frankly, and having listened carefully, the whole thing is very confusing.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para15"></a>Perhaps I may make a rather bold suggestion. We all have great respect for the Attorney-General's legal ability, but instead of committing himself to an answer on these confusing and difficult questions now, perhaps he would consider between now and Report the whole use of the expressions, "administrative proceedings", "criminal proceedings" and "clemency".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   By prefacing it by paying me that compliment, the noble Lord makes a seductive invitation, but, notwithstanding that, one to which I shall not accede. The specific point here is the definition of "clemency proceedings". Clause 52 refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"proceedings in a country outside the United Kingdom, not being proceedings before a court exercising criminal jurisdiction".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-21_para16"></a>
I understand that to mean that the court that is hearing the clemency proceedings is not a court exercising criminal jurisdiction.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para17"></a>The closest analogy I can provide&#151;although this would not be proceedings&#151;is that of a Home Secretary exercising clemency in the days when Home Secretaries did that. He would not be a court exercising criminal jurisdiction, but most certainly he would be considering the removal or reduction of a penalty that had been imposed on conviction of an offence. Not being familiar with the procedures in our European partner countries, my understanding is that there are proceedings that are not before a court exercising criminal jurisdiction but that involve consideration of removal or reduction of a penalty that has been imposed on conviction of an offence.
<P>

<a name="30123-21_para18"></a>I would expect that that means conviction of an offence in a criminal court. I hesitate about that only because the noble Baroness introduced the question of whether that may even apply to administrative offences. I do not want to say that it does not, although it seems to me unlikely that it does. The basic case will be that there has been conviction of an offence and there is a procedure called a clemency proceeding that goes before a body that is not a court exercising criminal jurisdiction that considers whether the penalty should be removed or reduced. If that is wrong, someone will write to correct me.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The logical conclusion of what the noble and learned Lord says would seem to be that there can be no clemency in relation to criminal proceedings elsewhere.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   I apologise to the noble Lord for partly not hearing and partly not understanding his point. Perhaps he would be kind enough to repeat it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Perhaps I may explain. The Attorney-General is trying to persuade us that clemency in relation to proceedings outside this country refers not to criminal proceedings but to administrative proceedings, as defined elsewhere. But I cannot believe that there is no clemency in relation to criminal proceedings outside this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   If the noble Lord is picking up on what I said before, I do not think that he cites me&#151;or at least my intention&#151;accurately. No doubt that is my fault, not his. The best way to deal with the matter is for me to say that we shall consider it and, if there is something wrong in what I said, ensure that that is communicated. I was suggesting that this appears to be a form of procedure not known to us. I tried to give the closest analogy of which I could think.

<a name="30123-22_para0"></a>As the definition identifies, it involves proceedings before a body that is not a court exercising criminal jurisdiction but is considering the removal or reduction of a penalty that has been imposed on conviction of an offence.

<A NAME="30123-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   Before the noble Baroness withdraws whichever amendment she is going to withdraw, I thank the Attorney-General for saying that he would consider the point that I raised about the wording, "administrative proceedings".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-22_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   First, I accept with alacrity the offer by the noble and learned Lord to take on board Amendment No. 127, in its modest drafting of a couple of words. If I had such luck with all probing amendments, I should be happy indeed, but I cannot expect that.
<P>

<a name="30123-22_para1"></a>The Committee's debate on the other amendments has highlighted the confusion that is so easily caused by the subject matter of the Bill and, occasionally, its manner of drafting. I do not say that in any way to criticise the draftsmen&#151;far from it. It is an extremely difficult Bill to write in a form that is applicable to our system, given that its provision is sometimes pan-European and sometimes pan-World. We shall consider more closely the amendment that I am about to withdraw, especially having heard what has been said by my noble friends Lady Carnegy and Lord Renton. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

in Clause 14(1)(c). I take it that they relate to both clemency proceedings and to an appeal in respect of administrative proceedings.

<a name="30123-22_para7"></a>What level of certainty is required for the test laid down in the Bill of an "intention" to carry on such proceedings to be met and a request made?

We are trying to probe the level of certainty.
<P>

<a name="30123-22_para8"></a>Amendment No. 39 is intended to allow us to consider more fully the definition of "administrative proceedings", in the light of last week's debate. We have just had a further snapshot of that. I hope that the Attorney-General can return to that in this context to give us a further burst of clarity.
<P>


<a name="column_GC74"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-22_para9"></a>The amendment would restrict the definition of "administrative proceedings" to proceedings that if carried on in the United Kingdom would be proceedings before a court. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   On Amendment No. 38, the noble Baroness asked what degree of certainty is required before one can say that something is intended to be carried on. Let me first explain the purpose of those words.
<P>

<a name="30123-22_para10"></a>Amendment No. 38 would restrict assistance in relation to clemency and administrative proceedings to where proceedings had already started. That would introduce an unacceptable restriction on assistance. It would be in contrast to existing mutual legal assistance arrangements, by which we assist at the investigative stage. We can see that if we compare Clause 14(1)(c) with Clause 14(1)(b), which specifically provides that assistance can be given not only where criminal proceedings but where criminal investigations are being carried on.
<P>

<a name="30123-22_para11"></a>As for when it is right to say that clemency proceedings or other proceedings are intended to be carried on, the only answer that I can give is that they are intended to be carried on when they are intended to be carried on. That question will depend on the facts of the case.
<P>

<a name="30123-22_para12"></a>I accept that Amendment No. 39 has been tabled to probe further what is meant by "administrative proceedings". In a sense, it does that well, because it would widen their scope far too far. It would define administrative proceedings as:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"proceedings that if carried on in the United Kingdom would be proceedings before a court".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-22_para13"></a>
That would include general civil proceedings, which are not relevant to the process.
<P>

<a name="30123-22_para14"></a>The definition of administrative proceedings in Clause 52(1) is deliberately precise and intended to catch the sort of administrative offences that we have been doing our best to illustrate and identify, but not to go further. So, I must resist both amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-22_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I shall not take up the Committee's time. I appreciate the noble and learned Lord's answer and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30123-22_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 41. Amendment No. 40 would introduce the concept of dual criminality into the definition of criminal proceedings used in Clause 14. <P>


<a name="column_GC75"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC75</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>There is currently no requirement in the clause for the offences with which criminal proceedings or investigations abroad are concerned to be offences under the law of the United Kingdom. A request could therefore be made to the United Kingdom authorities to gather evidence in relation to an investigation or proceedings in respect of acts that were not crimes under the law of this country. At its lowest, Clause 14(2) would allow a request for evidence to be made when there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that such an offence had been committed.
<P>

<a name="30123-22_para19"></a>Of course, I recognise that the Bill replicates and develops what already exists in Section 4 of the 1990 Act. However, I should be grateful if the noble and learned Lord would explain the extent to which the provisions of the 1990 Act have been used in respect of crimes abroad that are not offences under United Kingdom law, and to what extent the Government envisage that the provisions of the Bill will be so used in future.
<P>

<a name="30123-22_para20"></a>Amendment No. 41 relates to the issuing of certificates by authorities in other countries that will be conclusive in relation to the question of whether an offence under the law of another country has been committed and whether proceedings have been instituted there. The noble Lords, Lord Filkin and Lord Bassam, and I are all old hands from the proceedings of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. We all recall the debate on such certificates on a hot evening on 23rd July last year at col. 289 of the Official Report and remember the unhappiness that was expressed with some implications of those certificates.
<P>

<a name="30123-22_para21"></a>So although I realise that the Bill's provisions expand on those of the 1990 Act, I ask the noble and learned Lord about the operation of such certificates and whether the United Kingdom authorities have yet encountered any problems with the operation of the system. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="30123-22_para22"></a>I ask the following question. As my noble friend has pointed out, if one looks at the power to arrange for the evidence to be obtained, the court has to be satisfied that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an offence under the law of the country in question has been committed"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-22_para23"></a>
that is, the country making the application. It does not necessarily have to be satisfied that similar conduct would be a crime in this country. Does that change the current law or not? I suspect that it does not. I believe that the 1990 Act has a similar provision.

It appears that, so far as fiscal offences are concerned&#151;which I presume may or may not include money laundering&#151;the court has to show that it is satisfied that the offence in question constitutes an offence in this country, whereas, as regards general applications, the court does not have to satisfy itself in that regard. What is the reason for that distinction?

<A NAME="30123-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   First, I address Amendment No. 40 which proposes that dual criminality should be a requirement in relation to any request for evidence. The noble Baroness has already provided the answer to that point, as has the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle. I refer to the position under the 1990 Act. That Act does not require that the dual criminality requirement should be met, and neither does the provision we are discussing. I suggest to the Committee that it is absolutely right that it should not. To require a demonstration that the offence is an offence in this country would require an overseas authority investigating an offence under its own law to take on an unnecessary burden. By parity of reasoning we would not want overseas authorities to decline to deal with our requests on the ground that they were not sure that the matter about which we complained as a potential criminal offence was a criminal offence under their law as well.
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, asked why there is different provision in relation to fiscal offences. I suggest that the answer to that is that there is always different provision in relation to fiscal offences. They are regarded as of a particular character. I refer to traditional enforcement and assistance in regard to other countries' revenue laws. Those matters have always been treated in a special way. I anticipate&#151;I shall be corrected if I am wrong&#151;that that background has resulted in a different regime in relation to fiscal offences. The noble Lord may recall from his practice at the Bar special rules under which English courts do not recognise certain decisions in relation to fiscal matters, whereas they do in relation to other matters.
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para1"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 41. The answer is the same. This is precisely the provision under the 1990 Act; namely, that a certificate should be conclusive. The territorial authority is not required to go behind the request and independently establish the facts of the case. I suggest that that was right in 1990 and remains right today. It would be impractical and undesirable to do otherwise. We would expect other countries to treat <P>


<a name="column_GC77"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC77</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>our certificates with the same respect, in the event that a certificate is necessary at all. With that explanation, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I appreciate that reply which goes to the heart of the matter. There is a quid pro quo here. It is a matter of mutual recognition. We must be able to ensure that other countries are prepared to take action when we want them to do something on our behalf. I refer to the Minister's comments on the 1990 Act. We seek to test the waters to find out how that Act has operated so far and whether its operation may be changed slightly as a result of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30123-23_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 44, I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 45, 48 and 50 with which it is grouped. The whole purpose of this group is to test the statement at page 10 of the Government's Explanatory Notes about Article 13 of the convention.
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para15"></a>The Explanatory Notes state at paragraph 58 on page 10, with reference to Clause 16:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subsection (2)(b) provides that a search warrant or production order may be applied for and executed without an overseas request if the constable who makes the application is a member of an <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>international joint investigation team (as defined by subsection (5)) . . .  These provisions implement Article 13(7) of MLAC which contemplates investigative measures being undertaken without such a request by seconded members of a joint investigation team in relation to the team's investigations overseas".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-23_para16"></a>
I have tabled the amendment to ask the noble and learned Lord to explain the apparent discrepancy between the drafting of the subsection with the information in the transposition note placed in the Library. That states that Clause 16(2)(b), among others, implements Article 13(7) enabling UK constables and customs officers seconded to joint investigation teams to obtain search warrants. It states that the constable or customs officer would make the application on the basis of his personal knowledge of the joint investigation, as he would in a domestic investigation. However, as the Committee is aware, subsection (2)(b) of Clause 16 simply refers to a constable. What is the reason for that? Has the power been given to a customs officer, and, if so, how?
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para17"></a>Amendment No. 45 seeks to write into the Bill the relevant wording in the Explanatory Notes. Paragraph 58 of the Explanatory Notes states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The constable making the application for the warrant or order would have personal knowledge of the joint investigation as he would in making such an application in a domestic investigation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-23_para18"></a>
However, this requirement for personal knowledge is absent from the Bill. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will be able to explain why the Government have decided that that should be the case and why it appears from the Bill that a constable will be able to make an application even where he has no personal knowledge of an international joint investigation, contrary to what the Government say they intend in the Explanatory Notes.
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para19"></a>Amendment No. 48 would require that any evidence seized by a constable by virtue of the provisions in Clauses 16, 17 and 18 would have to be delivered to the court or authority which made the request for assistance within such time as the Secretary of State may by order prescribe. I am, of course, always wary of giving additional powers to the Secretary of State&#151;he has enough&#151;but this is a probing amendment designed to clarify the timescale within which the seized evidence will have to be delivered to the court or authority that made the request.
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para20"></a>Amendment No. 50 is in similar vein. It seeks to prompt clarification from the Government on whether or not it will be standard practice to make and retain copies of the evidence obtained under Clauses 16, 17 and 18 before forwarding it to the relevant overseas authority. The evidence may be lost in transit, damaged or destroyed for some other reason. Do the Government plan that there should be a copy or photograph of the evidence as a back-up to cater for those eventualities? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   I shall deal first with Amendment No. 44. The answer to the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, is to be found in Clause 27(1)(b). She asked about customs officers. Clause 27(1)(b) provides for a power under which customs officers can be granted any of the powers conferred on police officers under Clauses 13 to 26.
<P>


<a name="column_GC79"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para21"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 45. It may help if I explain the purpose of Clause 16(2)(b). A framework for establishing international joint investigation teams was provided for in Article 13 of MLAC. The purpose of those teams is to carry out joint investigations into crimes with cross-border elements, with a view to improving and speeding up investigation of those crimes. Teams will be set up by two or more member states for a specific purpose, and investigations may be carried out in any of those member states. In practice, a joint investigation team will consist mainly of police and customs officers from the participating member states, but their examining magistrates, prosecutors and specialist advisers may also take part.
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para22"></a>All members of the team must act under the direction of the team leader, who must be provided by the competent authorities of the participating member state where the team is carrying out its investigation. If the investigation moves into another participating member state, the team leader would change.
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para23"></a>The subsection enables constables acting as members of international joint investigation teams to apply for search warrants or production orders under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. As the noble Baroness said, this implements Article 13(7) of MLAC, which provides that members of a team should be able to request their own authorities to take such measures as they would be able to request in a domestic investigation.
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para24"></a>A UK member of a team who is a police officer would be able under the subsection to apply for a search warrant or production order for evidence in the UK in relation to an overseas investigation, without a formal request for the evidence from abroad. Such a request would be unnecessary as the police officer would be applying for the search warrant or production order on the basis of his own knowledge of the investigation. That is a long but, I hope, not unhelpful, explanation of joint investigation teams.
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para25"></a>Amendment No. 45 is unnecessary because the constable applying for a search warrant must be a member of the international joint investigation team and will therefore have personal knowledge of the joint investigation, just as he would if he were a member of a domestic investigation team. I hope that that explanation helps the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para26"></a>Amendment No. 48 would impose a time limit for the transmission of seized evidence to the requesting authority. We believe that that would be unnecessarily restrictive. We are under no obligation to return evidence within a specified time. Current legislation does not set time limits. No doubt it is a matter of good practice that evidence is generally returned as soon as possible, but that does not automatically mean that there will be a specified time limit. There may sometimes be good reason not to return evidence immediately; for example, if the request involves a number of searches, it may be practical to wait for all the evidence to be collected and consolidated before sending some of it back.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-23_para27"></a>I turn finally to Amendment No. 50. We do not see any point in having a requirement that copies of all evidence sent abroad should be kept. That is of no practical benefit to the United Kingdom authorities. It does not happen at present and the Government do not see any need to change that practice. It is possible that the police will keep a record, but certainly we can see no practical benefit in a requirement to retain a copy of every single document provided to an overseas authority. Therefore, I invite the noble Baroness not to press that amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30123-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I want to say a word about Amendment No. 48 to which the noble and learned Lord referred briefly. The kind of proceedings that we must envisage are entirely new situations so far as concerns this country. The interesting point about the Bill is that it creates new situations which the Government and our legal authorities will sometimes have difficulty in enforcing. I believe that the expression,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"within such times as the Secretary of State may by order prescribe",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-23_para28"></a>
is worth including. I do not consider that we can simply live optimistically in relation to this matter; we must ensure against unnecessary delays. Therefore, although I do not ask the noble and learned Lord to commit himself at the moment, I hope that between now and Report he will give further thought to that point.

<P>
<A NAME="30123-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his response and, in particular, for the clarity that he has given to the matter of the joint investigation team. That was worth adding to the record. With regard to time limits, I agree with my noble friend Lord Renton that, sometimes, good practice should not only be debated but should be put into effect. I shall certainly consider that point&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   As the noble Baroness has referred to that point, perhaps she will allow me to intervene to say that this is not new law. Again, the reference is to the 1990 Act, which does not prescribe a time limit; and I am told that there have been no problems in practice. If that is the case&#151;wise though the words of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, may be&#151;it seems unnecessary to change matters on this occasion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The Minister managed to interrupt the sentence just as I was about to say that I realised that it was part of the 1990 Act. Therefore, although I shall consider the matter again, the issue comes within the context of the general pattern of good practice. I shall also look again at the matter of copies of evidence, which was referred to by the noble and learned Lord. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 46:

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-24_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30123-24_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 46, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 49, which is in the same group, although the amendments deal with somewhat different issues.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para7"></a>Amendment No. 46 would amend Clause 19(1). Under that subsection, at present:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any evidence seized by a constable under . . . section . . . 17 . . . is to be sent to the court . . . which made the request for assistance".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-24_para8"></a>
The effect of the amendment would be that, instead of being sent to the court, the evidence would be sent to the Secretary of State, who would then forward it to the court or authority which made the request for assistance. Therefore, it would be monitored by an independent agency within the United Kingdom before it went abroad.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para9"></a>The amendment has been proposed by the Law Society, which is concerned that there should be independent monitoring of the order and of the evidence seized. It is a matter of some concern whether the provisions in Clause 26, which will prevent the evidence which is protected by legal privilege being sent abroad, will be sufficiently observed.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para10"></a>Of course, the court cannot make an order under Clause 26 unless it has reasonable grounds for believing that it does not consist of items subject to legal privilege. But the fact that some items may be subject to legal professional privilege will not necessarily be apparent on the face of the document. Indeed, even if it is, it may from time to time be overlooked.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para11"></a>If the person whose property had been seized were properly legally advised, he would no doubt be able to raise this issue before the property was removed from the United Kingdom. However, it is possible that he will not be properly legally advised or that, for some reason, such as absence from the country, he will not have an opportunity to raise the matter before the property is sent abroad. Therefore, it seems desirable that there should be some way of monitoring what is happening in order to see whether any particular problem arises.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para12"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 49, which I consider to be of some importance. Under Clause 14, before a United Kingdom authority arranges for evidence to be obtained in order to assist foreign criminal proceedings or an investigation, it must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been committed or that the investigation is being carried on in a requesting country. However, once the evidence has been sent, there is no restriction on the use that can be made of it in the requesting country.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para13"></a>This amendment has been tabled in response to concerns raised by Justice. I should declare that I am a vice-chair of the council of Justice. Those concerns are that the provision could lead to a fishing expedition and that a foreign country could institute proceedings. <P>


<a name="column_GC82"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The foreign court could then give a certificate under Clause 14(2) if there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence had been committed or that an investigation was being carried on. The evidence could then be taken and sent to the requesting country. That country could use the evidence for any purpose and not merely for the proceedings or investigation for which it was originally obtained.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para14"></a>That could present problems, even if these provisions were limited to a participating country. But, in fact, the provisions apply to any country in the world. Therefore, we believe that the territorial authority should have a power, but not an obligation, to require an undertaking to be given by the requesting court or authority that the evidence will be used only for the purpose for which it has been sent. That power could be used if, for example, it was believed that countries which received the evidence were using it to go on fishing expeditions and if it were felt that some control needed to be exercised over it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-24_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I have a brief question. Does the Minister accept that, where there is direct transmission, it is possible that material that was not directly relevant to the investigation could be seized? What do the Government intend should happen to such material?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   This group of amendments deals with two separate topics. The first is the question of the route for transmission. In speaking to Amendment No. 46 in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Dholakia and Lord Goodhart, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 47 and 64, which stand in the name of my noble friend Lord Filkin.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para15"></a>The first amendment would require all evidence seized in response to a request for evidence under the search powers in Clauses 16, 17 or 18 to be sent abroad via the UK Central Authority, rather than being transmitted directly from the constable who seized it. It would not allow any flexibility between those two methods.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para16"></a>For all the reasons that I explained earlier, the Government want to make the transmission of evidence directly by the constable who seized it the norm. It would be a more efficient means of sending evidence and would cut out central involvement in the UK once the evidence had been obtained. However, we recognise that, while that should be the norm, there will be some cases where direct transmission of evidence may not be appropriate. That would be the case if there were, for example, a very complex request where evidence was to be taken at multiple locations by multiple police forces and it would be more practical to send all the evidence back to the Central Authority, which could then send it on. The Government tabled Amendment No. 47 in order to permit flexibility.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para17"></a>The noble Lord tabled his amendment on the basis that he would like there to be control by the Central Authority of the evidence seized, particularly in relation to questions of legal professional privilege. But present practice is that the UK Central Authority <P>


<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does not currently inspect seized evidence. It may be voluminous and substantial. Therefore, transmission via the territorial authority through the Central Authority will not give the imprimatur of quality that the noble Lord wants; it will simply delay the process. Therefore, we resist the attempt to require that to be the only route.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para18"></a>Amendment No. 49 seeks to restrict the use to which the requesting authority may put evidence obtained from the United Kingdom. The Government consider that the requirement imposed by that amendment would be unduly restrictive. We cannot legislate for overseas authorities. If we made such a requirement, we would have no way of enforcing it in the absence of a binding international agreement. We can, and do, restrict our own use of evidence obtained from overseas but, as a matter of policy and practicality, would not wish to establish a general obligation to do so in relation to incoming requests.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para19"></a>We do restrict the use of material obtained using Section 2 powers of the SFO. Those are particularly powerful powers, if I can use that expression&#151;I cannot think of another at present. But, as a matter of policy or practicality, we would not think it right to have a general obligation in the way that Amendment No. 49 would require. Therefore, we resist that amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I appreciate the difficulties that Amendment No. 46 would create. I have raised that issue and it is not a matter that I should expect to take any further. I welcome government Amendment No. 47.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para20"></a>Amendment No. 49 still causes me some concern. I appreciate that there would be serious difficulties in enforcing it, but I am concerned that some countries may use information supplied under this power for purposes which might be regarded in this country as improper.
<P>

<a name="30123-24_para21"></a>In those circumstances, I shall consider whether to bring back an amendment for consideration in some other form. That said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30123-25_para4"></a>A domestic freezing order must be made by a judicial authority; and a freezing order, whether domestic or overseas, can have serious effects. It may, for example, deprive the owner of property of the use of that property for a substantial time or possibly even permanently. In such cases, while we support the idea of mutual assistance, we feel it is desirable that such orders should be granted only where in another country, as in this country, the order has been made by a judicial authority. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   Given the noble Lord's remarks, his proposal is even more radical than the amendment that he has moved. Even if the amendment were accepted, the provision would leave overseas freezing orders capable of being made either by,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a court exercising criminal jurisdiction in the country",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-25_para5"></a>
or by,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a prosecuting authority in the country".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-25_para6"></a>
With respect, it does not make sense to say that the amendment is designed to have the effect that a freezing order can be made only by a court.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para7"></a>Under the framework decision, we are under an obligation to recognise orders issued by judicial authorities. In a number of EU countries, orders of this kind could be made by examining magistrates, who have no precise equivalent in this country. They are plainly legitimate judicial authorities&#151;"judicial authority" is the description in the framework decision. But, plainly, we must be able to enforce orders that they make. An examining magistrate might not accurately fall within the description,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a court exercising criminal jurisdiction in the country",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-25_para8"></a>
or,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a prosecuting authority in the country".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-25_para9"></a>
Therefore, the purpose of Clause 20(3)(c) is to cover all judicial authorities in other EU countries. I say "other EU countries" because that is the limit on the application of this provision. EU judicial authorities are designated under the 1959 Council of Europe convention, so they are clearly identified.

<a name="30123-25_para10"></a>For many years, we have been able to execute requests for mutual legal assistance, including for search and seizure, by authorities of this type. Section 7(4)(b) of the 1990 Act includes that type of person. That is re-enacted by Clause 13(2)(b) of the Bill. So the provision merely applies to the new concept of the freezing order the same approach that has already been adopted in relation to mutual legal assistance. It has not caused any difficulties in practice. It must be available for the enforcement of overseas freezing orders.

<a name="30123-25_para12"></a><P>

<a name="30123-25_para13"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: In moving this amendment, standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Filkin, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 55, 60 to 63, 74 to 76, 128, 132 and 133.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para14"></a>These are all technical and drafting points. Amendment No. 52 to Clause 20 is a drafting amendment to reflect correctly the requirement of the framework decision for the certificate to be signed by or on behalf of the competent judicial authority.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para15"></a>Amendment No. 55 to Clause 21 clarifies that the rules referred to here are rules of court, which may be made under Clause 49 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para16"></a>The two amendments to Clause 24&#151;Amendments Nos. 60 and 61&#151;have the effect of simplifying the structure of the clause and clarifying that evidence seized should be retained until a request has been received and considered. The previous drafting did not reflect the framework decision in that respect and would have required automatic transmission of evidence by virtue of receipt of the request without allowing for it to be considered.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para17"></a>Amendments Nos. 62 and 63 to Clause 25 are designed to clarify the conditions for the release of evidence to ensure that evidence may be released only in accordance with the grounds provided for in the framework decision.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para18"></a>The three amendments to Clause 28&#151;Amendments Nos. 74 to 76&#151;are designed to make it clear that an offence prescribed under Clause 28(5)(b) may be prescribed by means of a general description and not only by specifying a particular offence. That will enable us to designate not only the offences listed in Article 3(2) of the framework decision but also a generic type of offence. It will cover, for example, cases covered by Article 3(4), in relation to which we are obliged to assist if there is dual criminality.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para19"></a>The first amendment to Clause 52&#151;Amendment No. 128&#151;simply adds a definition of "customs officer" to the existing list. The second amendment&#151;Amendment No. 132&#151;clarifies that the existing definition of "process" applies to England, Wales and <P>


<a name="column_GC86"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC86</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Northern Ireland. A separate definition has been added, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, may be pleased to note, for Scotland correctly to reflect the legal terms used in the different legal systems. The third amendment&#151;Amendment No. 133&#151;is needed because there was a concern that, as currently drafted, a summons issued by a prosecuting authority, as opposed to a court, overseas&#151;for example, an examining magistrate&#151;would not be included within the definition of "process" in Clause 52. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 53:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 12, line 21, leave out "a court" and insert "the High Court"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-25_para23"></a><P>

<a name="30123-25_para24"></a>The noble Baroness said: When the overseas freezing order is received, the Secretary of State has to nominate a court in England and Wales or Northern Ireland to give effect to the order under Clause 21(1). But Clause 21 is silent on what level of court that must be. I have tabled the amendment merely to ask the noble and learned Lord whether it could be a magistrates' court, a county court, a Crown Court, a High Court or even the Special Immigration Appeals Commission.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para25"></a>My amendment requires that the order should be given effect by the High Court, merely to elicit from the noble and learned Lord an explanation of which court is "a court" for these purposes. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The Government should consider this amendment carefully. I cannot imagine that minor matters will be the subject of proceedings under the Bill. I should have thought that the Secretary of State, instead of merely referring the matter to some relatively minor local court&#151;which he could do under the Bill as drafted&#151;should refer it to the High Court.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para26"></a>I say with respect to my noble friend that to replace the expression "a court" with "the High Court" is not quite adequate in terms of drafting. I think that the amendment should refer to an application to the High Court in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, as the case may be, to give effect to the overseas freezing order.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para27"></a>This is a minor drafting matter. In principle, however, I believe that it should become the responsibility of the High Court rather than any minor court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   This short debate has strongly reflected the other way round our previous debate in Committee on freezing orders. Then, I argued strongly that it was entirely appropriate that magistrates' courts, which have great experience in dealing with the granting of search warrants, should deal with the granting of domestic freezing orders.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para28"></a>The current position in relation to requests for mutual legal assistance is that the provision in the 1990 Act leaves it to the Secretary of State to decide which <P>


<a name="column_GC87"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC87</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>court should deal with the matter. Albeit in the context of freezing orders, that is precisely what is proposed in this clause.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para29"></a>The Government could not accept the amendment that imposed the obligation to limit execution of these orders simply on the High Court. As I said on a previous occasion, it would be wrong to compare evidence freezing orders with assets freezing orders. They are quite different. They are simply another form of gathering evidence at the request of an overseas government.
<P>

<a name="30123-25_para30"></a>Requests for evidence from overseas are currently generally dealt with by a magistrates' court. The Secretary of State has the power to put it to someone else, but there seems no reason why that procedure should not be followed for evidence freezing orders under the new procedure. That is why we cannot accept Amendment No. 53.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-25_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful, as always, to my noble friend Lord Renton for his comments on drafting.

<a name="30123-26_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 57.
<P>

<a name="30123-26_para4"></a>These amendments return to the issue of double jeopardy. Clause 21(6) allows the court not to give effect to the overseas freezing order if,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the person whose conduct is in question were charged in the participating country with the offence to which the overseas freezing order relates, he would be entitled to be discharged under any rule of law in that country relating to previous acquittal or conviction".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-26_para5"></a>
That is, he would be able to rely on any rule against double jeopardy. The amendments would change the applicable rules on double jeopardy to those in the relevant part of the United Kingdom. This amendment probes whether there will be situations in which a person would be able to rely on the double jeopardy rule in the UK, but any rule of the overseas country. Thus, if the conduct had been committed in <P>


<a name="column_GC88"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC88</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the UK, the courts would be giving effect to an order that might be contrary to the principles of double jeopardy that we apply.
<P>

<a name="30123-26_para6"></a>Perhaps the noble and learned Lord would also clarify the reference to a "previous . . .  conviction" in that subsection. Might that prevent the freezing of evidence relevant to criminal investigations where there had been a conviction overseas, even though the criminal investigation was ongoing, perhaps in relation to further offences or in respect of accomplices who were involved in the offence? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   I say straight away that these amendments will be considered. As they stand, they would have the effect of limiting the double jeopardy approach to consideration of the law of the United Kingdom. Clause 21(6) has been drafted to prevent the requesting state seeking evidence that could not be used in its courts because of the double jeopardy rule and we should not want the United Kingdom to have to send evidence to France when there was no possibility of a trial ever taking place there. That would be an abuse of the system.
<P>

<a name="30123-26_para7"></a>The amendment would prevent us from taking that proper approach, which we do not think wise and we cannot accept it as it is currently drafted. However, we agree that it should be possible to refuse cases in which prosecution would violate our own rules on double jeopardy and we will further consider bringing forward our own amendment to provide for refusal in cases in which prosecution would violate United Kingdom rules of double jeopardy. I hope that that is helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   That is most helpful. I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for saying that he will consider the principle further; that is exactly what we were trying to get at. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30123-26_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: Under Clause 20, when an overseas freezing order is sent to this country, it must be accompanied by a certificate giving the specified information. There are provisions about how it must be signed and it must include,

<P>

<a name="30123-26_para16"></a>Amendment No. 58, which was raised because of concerns from Justice, requires the order not to be made if it is caught by a third condition; that is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that the freezing order is manifestly incompatible with the certificate which accompanies it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-26_para17"></a><P>

<a name="30123-26_para18"></a>Article 7 of the draft framework decision sets out the grounds on which,

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"competent judicial authority of the executing State",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-26_para19"></a>
may refuse to apply the freezing order. One of the conditions is that the certificate,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is not produced, is incomplete or manifestly does not correspond to the freezing order".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-26_para20"></a>
That does not appear in the Bill. I appreciate that the reason for that may be that the Bill's draftsmen may have taken the view that it is implicit in Clauses 20 and 21 that a certificate that is manifestly incompatible with the freezing order cannot be a certificate within the meaning of Clause 20. I should appreciate that position. If that is not the case, it appears that there is a lacuna in the Bill. This is a probing amendment and I look forward to the Minister's response. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The basis of the amendment, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made clear, is the ground for refusal that is allowed for in Article 7(1)(a) of the framework decision.
<P>

<a name="30123-26_para21"></a>As a matter of principle, the Government agree that execution should be refused if the order and the certificate are manifestly incompatible. We differ over how that is to be determined. That, in our view, is for the Secretary of State to consider under Clause 20 when the request comes through. I emphasise, as does the article in the framework decision, that the relevant condition is that the certificate is manifestly incompatible with the order; it must be clear on the face of it. I am not trying to define "manifest"; I am merely explaining what the word means in ordinary English. Officials in the Central Authority will be well placed to consider that issue. The Government's view is that in those circumstances, the item will not be sent on and therefore will not reach the court in the first place.
<P>

<a name="30123-26_para22"></a>To put the matter briefly, one of the preliminary checks that the Secretary of State will carry out, under Clause 20, before referring the order to the court for enforcement, will be whether or not the order and the certificate are manifestly incompatible. It will be unnecessary for the court to make that decision and unnecessary therefore to place that requirement in the Bill as one of the requirements. I hope that the noble Lord is reassured that the Secretary of State sees that as one of the checks that has to be made by him and accepts that we do not believe it appropriate to agree to the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I certainly accept the procedure that is envisaged&#151;that the order should be looked at by the Secretary of State and should not be sent on to the court, and that it is therefore not necessary for the court to consider an incompatibility. I am still concerned that the Bill should state that before the Secretary of State sends a copy of the overseas freezing order to the court, he must satisfy himself that the <P>


<a name="column_GC90"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>certificate is one that is not incompatible with the terms of the overseas freezing order. I will consider that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   In considering that, I direct the noble Lord's attention to Clause 20(5), which requires the order to be,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"accompanied by a certificate which gives the specified information".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-26_para23"></a>
He may consider that if the certificate is incompatible with the order, it cannot be a certificate that contains the specified information; and if he agrees with that analysis, the Bill would contain something that the Secretary of State would have to consider.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-26_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I shall certainly consider that. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-26_para27"></a><P>

<a name="30123-26_para28"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment raises questions about PACE. It is intended to establish why only Section 21 of PACE, and not also Section 22, applies to seized evidence by virtue of Clause 22(4). After all, Section 21 of PACE is concerned with the right of the person from whom the evidence is seized to have access to it and to be able to copy it, so long as it would not prejudice police investigations. That will apply to evidence seized for the purposes of an overseas freezing order under the Bill's provisions.
<P>

<a name="30123-26_para29"></a>It appears, however, that Section 22 of PACE will not apply. That lays down provisions on the retention of evidence. I refer primarily to Section 22(1), which requires that evidence seized shall be retained only,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"so long as is necessary in all the circumstances".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-26_para30"></a>
Will the noble and learned Lord explain why the Government decided that Section 22 of PACE would not apply? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-26_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The answer to the noble Baroness's question is that Section 21 of PACE is appropriate because it applies in relation to the seizure of evidence, but Section 22 does not appear to the Government to be relevant because that relates to the retention of evidence, and that is not what the clause is about.
<P>

<a name="30123-26_para31"></a>It may help if I say more about Clause 22. It describes how the nominated court will give effect to the freezing order. The clause provides for the issue of a warrant by the nominated court. The warrant would authorise a constable to enter and search the specified premises to seize and retain specified property. It follows the procedures in PACE for giving effect to ordinary search warrants.
<P>

<a name="30123-26_para32"></a>In line with PACE, it also provides that for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, if the evidence to be seized is of such a character that, if there were domestic <P>


<a name="column_GC91"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC91</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proceedings, the appropriate procedure would be by way of a production order, the court should issue a production order.
<P>

<a name="30123-26_para33"></a>The clause authorises the constable to remove any material produced to him by virtue of a production order and confirms that any such material is to be treated as seized material. That brings in the reference to Section 21 of PACE.
<P>

<a name="30123-26_para34"></a>Clause 22(1)(b), as the noble Baroness notes and as I have just suggested, indicates that the warrant authorises the constable to "seize and retain" the evidence. I hope that that explanation is of assistance. I do not believe that there is anything at all sinister about this. The reference to Section 22 simply does not appear to the Government to be relevant in this context.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 15, line 12, leave out "Treasury" and insert "Secretary of State"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-27_para14"></a><P>

<a name="30123-27_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: I tabled the amendment in response to an issue raised in the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. Clause 27 contains an order-making power to provide that functions conferred on the territorial authority may be exercisable by the commissioners of Customs and Excise. In subsection (1), that order-making power is conferred on the Treasury and not on the Secretary of State. The second report from the Select Committee states in paragraph 7 that the department's memorandum does not explain why that power is exercisable by the Treasury rather than by the Secretary of State. It goes on say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There may be reasons for this, and the Committee considers that the Government should provide an explanation for this form of delegation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-27_para16"></a><P>

<a name="30123-27_para17"></a>I agree. I tabled the amendment so that the noble and learned Lord can give that explanation to the Committee. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Will the Minister consider some further reasons in this context, in addition to those given by my noble friend Lady Anelay? I concede that the expression "Treasury" has often been used in previous legislation. When I was a Home Office Minister years ago, I believe that I used it myself. However, the Treasury is merely a government department. Ministers should always be the people who are responsible for enforcing legislation when Parliament has required them to do so. The Bill should refer to those people. I do not know whether I am going too far or hoping for too much but I hope that the habit of calling on the Treasury to do something or to be given a power will cease and be replaced by a reference to the Chancellor of the Exchequer or a Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="30123-27_para18"></a>Of course, the expression, "Secretary of State" is a conveniently wide term. In the context of the Bill and of Clause 27 in particular, it would be more logical if the Secretary of State were given the power. The Secretary of State is referred to in subsection (1). Subsection (2) gives him a power, as do a number of earlier clauses. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will carefully consider this matter. It cannot harm the Bill to give the Secretary of State the power. It would be more logical and&#151;dare I say&#151;more precise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Amendment No. 66 in this group raises exactly the same point. However, since tabling the amendment, I have read the Government's response, which is printed as Annex 2 to the fifth <P>


<a name="column_GC93"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC93</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>report of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform, and I find that explanation adequate. Therefore, I would not in any event have moved my own amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The phrase used by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, describing the Treasury as "merely a government department" is one which I noted with interest. I do not believe that any Minister, as the noble Lord has been, with responsibility for a spending department would ever describe the Treasury as "merely a government department".
<P>

<a name="30123-27_para19"></a>As to the specific and perhaps somewhat constitutional point that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, raised about whether it is right to identify a particular person or body as "the Treasury" or "the Chancellor of the Exchequer", as the noble Lord himself indicated, the description of the Treasury is used in legislation&#151;indeed, it is used in the 1990 Act. No doubt Treasury Ministers will read with interest what the noble Lord, Lord Renton, said in relation to that.
<P>

<a name="30123-27_para20"></a>The principal point raised in the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, is whether it is right that these powers should be exercisable by the Treasury or by the Secretary of State. As Clause 27 makes clear, the powers relate to the exercise of powers by the commissioners of Customs and Excise or by an officer commissioned by Customs and Excise&#151;in other words, a Customs officer.
<P>

<a name="30123-27_para21"></a>The power for these orders is to be vested in the Treasury rather than the Secretary of State because the Treasury is the government department which has responsibility for Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. I do not believe that any question has been raised about whether it is right for Customs and Excise or Customs officers to have such powers. Indeed, the noble Baroness previously indicated that she wanted guidance as to where that power was to be found because it should be there. Therefore, the point is simply: who is the right person to exercise the powers??
<P>

<a name="30123-27_para22"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is right to draw attention to the explanation given to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. I understand that not only is the noble Lord content but that the committee has expressed itself content with the explanation given. I hope that that satisfies the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="30123-27_para23"></a>I should have said that in this group I shall speak also to government Amendments Nos. 67, 68, 69, 72 and 73, all standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Filkin. I should put on the record what those amendments seek to achieve. They seek to expand the powers that may be conferred on Customs officers under this section. The first government amendment&#151;Amendment No. 67&#151;is the key and the others are essentially consequential.
<P>

<a name="30123-27_para24"></a>The first amendment would make it possible to give Customs officers the power to apply for orders to freeze evidence overseas. As Customs officers could already be given powers to deal with incoming freezing orders, it seems sensible to ensure that they can deal <P>


<a name="column_GC94"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>also with outgoing requests. It is considered appropriate for Customs officers to be able to exercise such powers. For the same reasons, we consider it appropriate to ensure that Customs officers can apply for freezing orders as well as make requests for evidence through mutual legal assistance procedures.
<P>

<a name="30123-27_para25"></a>The Committee will know that Customs investigators frequently take the lead on international investigations, particularly concerning drug trafficking. It is just as likely that, as would a police officer, a Customs officer will wish to apply for an order to freeze evidence that he knew was located in another EU country. Therefore, if there were an investigation into drug trafficking involving the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, where Customs were leading in the UK and relevant evidence&#151;for example, papers relating to bank transactions&#151;was believed to be located in the Netherlands, it would make sense for the Customs officer who had been in possession of full knowledge of the case to be able to apply for the order to freeze that evidence.
<P>

<a name="30123-27_para26"></a>The other amendments in the group are consequential, apart from Amendment No. 128, which places the definition of a Customs officer in the definitions section.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-27_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his response.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-28_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30123-28_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 70, which stands in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 71, standing in my name.
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para2"></a>Amendment No. 70 would require that where the Treasury provides for a function conferred on a constable to be exercised by a Customs officer, or a person acting under the direction of such an officer, he would need to follow guidance issued by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para3"></a>Amendment No. 71 prompts clarification of the broad powers of the Secretary of State by Clause 27(2), which provide that functions conferred on him or on a <P>


<a name="column_GC95"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>constable under Sections 13 to 27 may be exercised by a prescribed person; in other words, more or less anyone.
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para4"></a>Paragraph 81 of the Explanatory Notes states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subsection (2) provides for the territorial authority to confer similar powers on other authorities in the future, should such other authorities develop a role in the execution of mutual legal assistance requests".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-28_para5"></a>
That is extremely vague. The powers allow the Secretary of State to confer these functions on anyone. That may well be flexible and what the Government require. We require the Government to clarify the types of bodies and persons they are thinking about at this stage.
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para6"></a>Finally, there is a drafting point that the Government might agree to look at. Clause 27(2) allows the Secretary of State to provide that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any function conferred on him under this group of sections",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-28_para7"></a>
may be exercisable by someone else. Does that extend the power under Clause 27(2) to confer functions on others? Thus the Secretary of State could, by order under Subsection (2), delegate his power to confer functions on others to someone else. The matter gets very complicated. Perhaps the Government might want to include the words "other than this subsection". I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   The purpose of the amendment is to require the Secretary of State to issue guidance describing the circumstances in which a Customs officer might exercise powers under Clauses 13 to 26. If I have misunderstood, I should be pleased to be corrected by the noble Baroness, but I do not think that I need to explain why it is thought essential to be able to confer powers on Customs. I hope that the answer that I gave in debate on a previous amendment explained that sufficiently clearly.
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para9"></a>There is no need for further guidance. The conditions will be prescribed by the order, which will be binding. No doubt it will be open to the Secretary of State to issue guidance on that point if that seems appropriate, but it is unnecessary to refer to that in the Bill. Of course, guidance will be issued covering all of the Bill's new provisions.
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para10"></a>Amendment No. 71 would delete Clause 27(2). That would also restrict a key enabling provision that is intended to allow authorities to take on executing powers in the same way as is provided for Customs. The new power will give the Government flexibility to effect greater direct transmission&#151;a subject which we have discussed&#151;should that be desirable in future. No other authorities have been identified at this stage, but a review of our mutual legal assistance system more generally&#151;which is currently in progress&#151;may <P>


<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>conclude that such powers should be conferred on the Crown Prosecution Service or Serious Fraud Office; for example, to enable them to handle incoming requests. However, at present they do not want such powers.
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para11"></a>I understand that the power was considered by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform, which accepted the department's explanation that we needed to provide flexibility for the future and found the power to be appropriately delegated.
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para12"></a>Clause 27(2) will not apply to the powers under Clause 27(1), because Amendments Nos. 67 and 72, one of which has been accepted and the other of which I have spoken to, amend Clause 27(1)(a).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-28_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   Perhaps I may begin by referring to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. I shall certainly not be able to point him to chapter and verse of Acts in which guidance has been included in the Bill. I am aware that Governments of any colour balk at the idea of including guidelines in Bills and that Opposition parties always want to include them. However, all Governments have passed Bills that make reference to guidelines; indeed, one part of the Courts Bill refers to guidelines, and we hope to add more&#151;I give notice of that intention. So such references exist, but I regret that I cannot steer the noble Lord to the precise reference. Perhaps I ought to ask the Library for at least one example to satisfy him.
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para13"></a>I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his explanation. His point about the drafting is absolutely right: changes to Clause 27 have dealt with that. On Amendment No. 71, he says that the Government are conducting a review and, as a result, other bodies may be identified&#151;the CPS or SFO, for example, although he says that at present they do not seek or welcome such status. He puts his finger on our problem with all of this, which is that whether it is the framework decision or whatever, so much of what will effectively govern the working of the Bill when enacted is not fully fleshed out. We are having to agree to procedures that may be modified in future. We want to ensure that they are modified in such a way as to act properly to ensure judicial co-operation. We are not trying to hinder that. We are trying to make it more straightforward while ensuring that proper safeguards are in place. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

""freezing order" means any measure taken by a competent judicial authority in the issuing State in order provisionally to prevent the destruction, transformation, moving, transfer or disposal of property that could be subject to confiscation or evidence,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-28_para22"></a>The noble Lord said: This is largely a probing amendment. It probes in two different respects. First, the amendment repeats the definition of a freezing order, which appears in Article 2(c) of the draft framework decision. That states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'freezing order' shall mean any measure taken by a competent judicial authority in the issuing State in order provisionally to prevent the destruction, transformation, moving, transfer or disposal of property that could be subject to confiscation or evidence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-28_para23"></a><P>

<a name="30123-28_para24"></a>There is no separate definition of "freezing order" in the Bill. Clause 28(1) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'domestic freezing order' has the meaning given by Section 10(2)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-28_para25"></a>
Clause 10(2) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A domestic freezing order is an order for protecting evidence which is in the participating country pending its transfer to the United Kingdom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-28_para26"></a>
Clause 28(1) defines "overseas freezing order" as having the meaning given to it by Section 20. Clause 20(2) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An overseas freezing order is an order&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-28_para27"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) for protecting, pending its transfer to the participating country, evidence which is in the United Kingdom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-28_para28"></a><P>

<a name="30123-28_para29"></a>Are the Government satisfied that the word "prevent" covers all the nouns referred to in Article 2(c) of the framework decision; that is: destruction; transformation; moving; transfer or disposal of property? I suspect that it probably does, and that it protects by preventing those things. However, it seems to me that "protect" could be wider than the definition in Article 2(c). If the evidence is something which is perishable by virtue of natural decay, unless it is literally frozen, "protect" would seem to cover taking steps to preserve an item of evidence by freezing it, but the wording of the framework decision would not. Is that seen as something that would create problems?
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para30"></a>My second point is one which I anticipate the noble and learned Lord may not be able to answer today. I shall be happy to have it dealt with later in writing. Under the framework decision, a freezing order can be used to protect property not only for the purposes of evidence but for the purposes of making it subject to a confiscation order.
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para31"></a>The Bill contains no reference to confiscation. So I wonder what is the position in regard to a freezing order for property which might be subject to confiscation. I have looked at Section 74 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, which relates to England; and there are equivalent provisions for Scotland and Northern Ireland. That appears to provide for the equivalent of a domestic freezing order where a confiscation order is being sought. But I cannot find in the Proceeds of Crime Act or anywhere else a provision for the equivalent of an overseas freezing <P>


<a name="column_GC98"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC98</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>order where confiscation proceedings may occur outside the United Kingdom and an order is sought in the United Kingdom for freezing that property subject to the making of a confiscation order. Is there such a provision anywhere in legislation, or have I overlooked it in the Proceeds of Crime Act? If not, is not one needed, and should it not be included in another part of the Bill?
<P>

<a name="30123-28_para32"></a>I see no equivalent to a domestic freezing order in proceedings for a civil recovery order under Part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act&#151;although this could well be because a civil recovery order cannot be regarded as confiscation within the meaning of the framework decision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I hope that the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General will consider the amendment sympathetically. Various types of freezing order are mentioned in the Bill, but, so far, only one has been defined.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para0"></a>Clause 10 refers to domestic freezing orders, and Clause 11 deals with the sending of freezing orders. Clause 12 refers to the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Variation or revocation of freezing orders".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-29_para1"></a>
Overseas freezing orders are dealt with at some length in Clause 20, and subsection 2 contains a definition of an overseas freezing order. But we are left wondering what are the other types of freezing order. The amendment is an attempt to provide an overall definition of any kind of freezing order, and it is a good attempt at drafting.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para2"></a>I do not think that the amendment goes quite far enough. It refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the destruction, transformation, moving, transfer or disposal of property".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-29_para3"></a>
"Property" is not defined. Although it could be argued that a definition is unnecessary, it could mean the disposal of information of various kinds, especially with modern equipment, and information is not regarded as property. Therefore, the word "information" could well be added and would make the amendment more complete. For the reasons given by the noble Lord, to which I have tried to add, we need a definition in the Bill.

<A NAME="30123-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   It might be helpful if I start by indicating an answer to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. He rightly drew attention to the fact that the framework decision deals with two kinds of freezing. It deals with arrangements for freezing assets&#151;that is property&#151;and for freezing material wanted as evidence. Those are two distinct concepts.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para4"></a>We believe that the freezing of evidence will facilitate international investigation. Therefore, we have taken the earliest opportunity to implement those new arrangements. That is the only part with which the Bill seeks to deal in the freezing context. Freezing of assets is a more complicated topic. It needs to take account of other developments. We already have new domestic, as well as international arrangements, in this <P>


<a name="column_GC99"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC99</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>area&#151;the noble Lord drew attention to some of those&#151;which were introduced by the Proceeds of Crime Act. The Government are keen to ensure that those are properly established before embarking on further steps at the international level.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para5"></a>In addition, the JHA Council is currently discussing a framework decision on the mutual recognition of confiscation orders. Asset freezing is a concept closely related to confiscation orders. To some extent it is an interdependent preliminary step to confiscation. We need to ensure that there is coherence and consistency of approach in the legislation adopted to implement both those instruments. That could not be resolved until the content of the confiscation instrument is settled. That is why the Bill does not attempt to deal with the freezing of property.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para6"></a>That being the case, it follows that the proposed amendment, which is lifted from the definition in Clause 2(c) of the framework decision, is necessarily too wide. The definition relates to property and evidence. There is another reason why it is too wide. The definition in Article 2(c) uses the concept "issuing state". An issuing state is defined in Article 2(a) of the framework decision with the important qualification of:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the framework of criminal proceedings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-29_para7"></a>
If one did not somehow include those words, this would be an extremely wide definition which would catch civil injunctions also. That is not what the Bill is designed to deal with.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para8"></a>For those reasons, this particular definition would be inappropriate. We take the view that the definitions of "domestic freezing order" in Clause 10(2) and "overseas freezing order" in Clause 20(2) are more than adequate. They are perfectly sufficient to identify what those two concepts deal with. I have listened attentively to the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Renton. However, at present it is not obvious to me that there is any gap. Given what the Bill is trying to achieve and given that both domestic freezing orders and overseas freezing orders are defined, enough is dealt with. For that reason, the Government cannot accept the amendment and do not believe that any additional definition is required.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Before the noble and learned Lord sits down, it is highly curious that various different kinds of freezing orders are mentioned in the Bill, but only one is defined. If the general reasons he has put forward are enough, one wonders why the overseas freezing order should require a definition. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius, if the Committee would forgive my saying that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   I can always forgive the noble Lord for speaking Latin, particularly in a legal context, although these days others take a different view.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para9"></a>I hope that it is helpful to say that at present I do not see where the gap is. We have two concepts in the Bill. First, the domestic freezing order, an order made in this country sent overseas, is defined in Section 10(2). That definition is picked up again in Clause 28(1). For <P>


<a name="column_GC100"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>example, although Clause 11 is headed "Sending freezing orders", the substantive provisions refer to a domestic freezing order which has been defined.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para10"></a>There is then the other sort of freezing order, the overseas freezing order. That is defined in Clause 20(2) and again picked up in Clause 28. There are provisions for dealing with overseas freezing orders. The noble Lord may want to consider further if there is a gap which I have missed, which I should be happy to deal with in correspondence. However, I hope that I have sufficiently answered his point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for his support. As regards the definition point, it is fair to say that this is a probing amendment, and I find acceptable the explanation given by the noble and learned Lord. As regards the making of a freezing order for the purposes of confiscation, I am happy that the noble and learned Lord was able to deal with that point today. I note with interest that we can expect further legislation to apply the concept of freezing orders to the process of confiscation in due course. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-29_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said: We now turn to the issues of hearing witnesses abroad through television links. Amendment No. 77, by way of general introduction, gives background to these matters. Currently, television links are covered by provisions in primary legislation. However, the amendment would allow the Secretary of State and Scottish Ministers power to extend it to other types of criminal proceedings by order.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para20"></a>Paragraph 85 of the Explanatory Notes does not give enough clarity. It states:

<a name="column_GC101"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
It would be helpful to know what other types of proceedings may be covered and what kind of departure from current practice might happen in future. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-29_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Filkin): </B>  Clause 29 partially implements Article 10 of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (the MLAC) which provides for hearing witnesses via video link where it is either not possible nor desirable for the witness to travel to the state where his evidence is required. The clause deals with the circumstances where the UK requests evidence in that way.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para22"></a>Clause 29 permits the Secretary of State to expand by a negative resolution order the types of proceedings in which the UK may request that kind of evidence from overseas. The amendment would require such an order to be made by affirmative rather than negative resolution. The Government do not believe that that would be necessary as UK courts are already able to request that type of assistance from overseas in certain proceedings by virtue of Section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and Section 273 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para23"></a>The types of proceedings covered presently include homicide, serious fraud cases and cases involving the evidence of children. The clause provides for those sections to apply to further types of proceedings. Clearly, there are many other potential criminal offences to which those types of proceedings could be applied. All I would say at this point is that there are no present plans by the Lord Chancellor's Department to do so.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para24"></a>I go further. Any decision to extend the types of cases in which that sort of assistance is provided would follow only after extensive consultation with all parties concerned and would reflect a consensus view across the criminal justice system. We believe, therefore, that Clause 29 provides a practical solution ensuring that Section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act and the corresponding Scottish provisions may be extended in future, but with the safeguard that that would be done only after the proper forms of consultation, which, I put on the record, were carried out.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para25"></a>The clause has general application and is not restricted to participating countries. That reflects the existing position under the Criminal Justice Act. We consider that those arrangements have particular benefit in relation to countries outside Europe, which may pose greater travel obstacles for witnesses. That sort of assistance is a useful tool in trials which deal with offences which take place in more than one state, and which are often those involving organised criminal gangs.
<P>

<a name="30123-29_para26"></a>In the report of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform on the Bill, no comment was made on the power. We understand, therefore, that it is satisfied that the level of scrutiny of <P>

<A NAME="30123-30_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response. He referred to the fact that the Select Committee was content with the provisions. I did not intend by my amendment to signal that we were not content with the Select Committee's decision. It was just a tool to elicit the helpful answer given by the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para0"></a>It is useful to have on the record that the Government would make these changes only after&#151;I believe the Minister said&#151;extensive consultation and having achieved consensus across the criminal justice system. Perhaps another matter which the Government would need to take into account is having the budgets to put in place the IT system. Perhaps that would be part of the consultation process. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 78:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 29, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-30_para3"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "APPLICATION OF SECTIONS 30 AND 31
<br>
(1) This section applies for the purposes of sections 30 and 31.
<br>
(2) Before a person gives evidence he shall be informed in ordinary language of&#151;
<br>
(a) whether or not he is compelled to give evidence (and if so in what circumstances), and
<br>
(b) the uses to which his evidence (or the fact of his failure to give evidence) may be put by the court in a country outside the United Kingdom before which the proceedings are carried on."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-30_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 78 seeks to clarify the position under Clauses 30 and 31 when witnesses are giving evidence to courts abroad from a court in the UK through a television or telephone link. I seek to elicit by way of clarity what rules on compellability will apply and what rules on the right to silence will apply. To what use will witnesses' evidence be put by the foreign court? Would there be, for example, protection against self-incrimination, or would that be a matter for the law of the foreign state in question on a case-by-case basis? Will the witness be informed of those rules before giving evidence?
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para5"></a>I return to a comment I made on the previous amendment. What will be the facilities for this to be carried out? Where will they be placed? Will they be part of the ordinary provision of IT for courts here or will there be special courts which will be particularly well provided with the right kind of IT back-up? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The purpose of this new clause is to increase the protection of witnesses summoned to give evidence via television link. While the Government understand the concerns behind the <P>


<a name="column_GC103"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment relating to rights of silence, compellability, use of evidence, and so forth, we believe that proper safeguards are already provided.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para6"></a>In the case of TV evidence, witnesses may be compelled to give evidence. In the case of telephone evidence, they may not. Schedule 2 makes clear that there is a significant difference between the two types of hearing. Paragraph 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 2, which relates to television links, and is entitled "Securing attendance of witnesses", states that the nominated court has powers for securing attendance of a witness as it does for proceedings before that court.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para7"></a>By contrast, paragraph 11 of Part 2 of Schedule 2, relating to telephone links, is headed "notification of witness" and gives the court the power only to inform a witness of when the hearing will take place. It goes on to state that the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"court must be satisfied that the witness is willingly giving evidence by telephone".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-30_para8"></a><P>

<a name="30123-30_para9"></a>Schedule 2 sets out the circumstances in which a witness cannot be compelled to give evidence by television link; namely, if he or she,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"could not be compelled to give [it] in criminal proceedings in . . .  the United Kingdom",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-30_para10"></a>
if participating in a domestic proceeding; if giving evidence,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"would be prejudicial to the security of the United Kingdom";
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-30_para11"></a>
or,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in his capacity as an officer or servant of the Crown".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-30_para12"></a>
The first point ensures that the witness is granted at least the same protections as in domestic proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para13"></a>The usual domestic summons procedures will apply in relation to television hearings under Schedule 2. The summons will be issued by the domestic court in accordance with our law under Section 97 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. Summonses set out when and where the witness should appear, the consequences of failure to comply and details of whom to contact for more information. We consider the existing summons procedure to be sufficient and robust.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para14"></a>The second requirement&#151;that the witness be informed about the uses to which the evidence may be put&#151;is unnecessary. Witnesses summoned to provide evidence by virtue of a summons issued under Clause 15 are not provided with information about the uses to which their evidence may be put, although they will obviously be aware of the context if they are being called as witnesses.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para15"></a>A witness giving evidence in domestic proceedings would similarly be aware of the context, but would not necessarily be informed of the detailed uses to which the evidence might be put. It is extremely unlikely that the domestic authority would be able to provide the witness with such information. The overseas authority conducting the hearing will inform the witness of as much as is necessary under its law regarding the use of evidence and the implications of failure to comply, but, as the hearing will be conducted under the <P>


<a name="column_GC104"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>supervision of that authority&#151;as is made clear in paragraph 6 of Schedule 2&#151;we would not include that condition in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para16"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the circumstances in which TV hearings might take place. I am advised by the Lord Chancellor's Department that some 154 magistrates' courts have already been set up for remand links and that these would generally be the ones used. These links currently operate only between courts and prisons for use in remand hearings. I am sure that the noble Baroness is familiar with those. The technology is in place and merely requires refinement by the responsible contractors in order to provide the link services to the courts.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para17"></a>The witness would be present in the UK court. The camera would be linked up to the court in the requesting country. Those facilities would enjoy the benefits of existing security controls in our court buildings. I can provide some examples of where we have seen such systems used in other countries. It is starting to be an established process and procedure and we are becoming increasingly familiar with it. I hope that that assists.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-30_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   One of the most important points was made at the very end of the noble Lord's remarks. He said that we are becoming more accustomed to these systems as they become more established. I should expect "we" to mean those who are involved daily in the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para18"></a>As a magistrate, I presided over a case where evidence was rightly given by television link. Of course, a witness&#151;or possibly a defendant, although we are dealing here with witnesses&#151;is not necessarily accustomed to such links. It may be the one and only occasion when a witness has come into contact with the court system, and certainly with television links. Therefore, I am sensitive as regards the amount of information that should properly be given to a witness. He may be an expert witness. The way in which the television links are set up, and the way in which split screens are used, may strongly govern the effectiveness of the evidence.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para19"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for setting out the general background. In particular, I am grateful to him for placing on record the Government's intention to use the magistrates' courts. We look forward to seeing how the resourcing goes in terms of making sure that it will work. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(1) This section applies for the purposes of sections 30 and 31.
<br>
(2) For the avoidance of doubt, proceedings before a nominated court are not to be treated as proceedings before a court of any country other than the United Kingdom, and nothing in sections 30 and 31 confers any jurisdiction on a court of any country other than the United Kingdom in respect of anything done in the United Kingdom."

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-30_para22"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 79 seeks to probe the position in respect of jurisdiction, especially in relation to contempt. Could a witness giving evidence from the United Kingdom be proceeded against for contempt in a foreign state even though his conduct was not a contempt under UK law and thus no action was taken under Clause 30(4)? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I support the amendment, although I have a confession to make: I have not kept in mind the detail of the Bill sufficiently to know whether the purpose of the clause has already been stated in any other way in the Bill. I hope it has not&#151;because in that case my noble friend's suggestion is rather desirable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for sparking this discussion, as it will enable us to clarify the situation. Other than for the purposes of contempt of court and perjury, television and telephone hearings are not proceedings before the domestic (UK) court. The Bill simply enables witnesses to be heard as part of proceedings before the overseas court.
<P>

<a name="30123-30_para23"></a>Under the Mutual Legal Assistance Convention we, as the home authority, are obliged to ensure that perjury and contempt of court in such circumstances are subject to domestic sanctions. That is necessary because the overseas court which is conducting the hearing will be unable to take any direct action itself. I hope that that provides the clarity sought by the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-31_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 80:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 17, line 5, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-31_para2"></a><P>

<a name="30123-31_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 81 to 84. They cover the giving of evidence by television links. Amendment No. 80 asks the Government to explain what authorities the Secretary of State considers will have the function to make requests as envisaged in the clause. Will they be courts, police, prosecuting authorities or public defenders? Who will be the authorities? I ask the question in order to have an answer on the record.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para4"></a>Amendment No. 81 inserts a new subsection which provides extra protections. The request should specify the reason why it is not desirable or possible for the witness or expert to attend in person; it should state the name of the judicial authority and the names of the <P>


<a name="column_GC106"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC106</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>persons who will conduct the hearing; and it should state that the witness is willing to give evidence by television link in the proceedings before that court.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para5"></a>I have not dreamt up those protections. They appear to be in paragraph 8 of the second additional protocol on page 7. Why have the Government decided not to put them on the face of the Bill?
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para6"></a>Amendment No. 82 removes the Secretary of State's discretion. Subsection (3) states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State must . . . in writing nominate a court in the United Kingdom where the witness may",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-31_para7"></a>
give evidence through a television link unless he considers it inappropriate to do so. I am trying to elicit guidance from the Minister. In what circumstances would the Secretary of State consider it inappropriate to give effect to a request for TV link evidence? The noble Lord may be able to provide an example from existing practice where it may have been thought inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para8"></a>Amendment No. 83 introduces an element of good practice into the procedure. It provides that the attention of the witness should be drawn to subsections (4) and (5) before he gives evidence, so that he is aware of the possible consequences of giving that evidence. In particular, it is important that people should be aware that UK rules on contempt and perjury will apply before they give their evidence.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para9"></a>As to Amendment No. 84, what happens if the contempt constitutes an offence of contempt under UK law but not under the law of the state where the evidence is being received? Would any further action be taken on that matter? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I agree with three of my noble friend's amendments, but there are two that I find rather difficult to support; namely, Amendments Nos. 80 and 82. She has a very powerful reason for seeking the Government's views on the need for Amendments Nos. 81, 83 and 84. Those or similar amendments are essential to ensure that justice is done. I shall not trouble the Committee with the detail at the moment, but the Government need to consider the matter very carefully. Perhaps the Minister would rather not give an answer today on Amendments Nos. 81, 83 and 84. However, I think that the points in those amendments must be dealt with.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I shall try to provide the best answer that I can. If I miss something, I am sure that we can pick it up later.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para10"></a>Amendment No. 80 deletes the explanation of the term "external authority". The noble Baroness was kind enough to explain that she is seeking guidance to what "external" authorities are. My understanding is that these are the same authorities that generally make requests for mutual legal assistance. They would be courts, prosecutors, central authorities, examining magistrates, official persons and bodies with investigative and prosecuting functions. I think that I am right in saying that these are drawn from arrangements that existed under the 1959 convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters. Article 24 of <P>


<a name="column_GC107"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that convention makes declarations stating which authorities it deems to be judicial authorities. That is where that definition is drawn from.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para11"></a>Amendment No. 81 would require incoming requests from overseas authorities to include the three pieces of information specified. We are not about to accept this amendment, although the Government understand the intention behind it; and we considered including the first two requirements on the face of the Bill. We concluded, however, that it would make the clause unnecessarily restrictive.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para12"></a>The first two conditions are requirements of article 10 of the Mutual Legal Assistance Convention. The problem with including these conditions in a clause of general application is that other future agreements containing provisions on television evidence might not be expressed in precisely the same terms as the convention. For that reason, we do not want the Bill to be drafted so narrowly as to exclude the granting of assistance under other agreements, although in practical terms we would expect these conditions to be met in order to be able to make the necessary administrative arrangements to set up the hearing.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para13"></a>That does not mean that we shall apply a lower standard to requests from outside the EU. In contrast, we consider that the current drafting provides for greater discretion in the absence of an international agreement, because of the general discretion provided for in subsection (3), which provides that the Secretary of State is to nominate a court to hear the evidence unless he considers it inappropriate to do so.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para14"></a>Imposing the third proposed condition&#151;that a witness is willing to give evidence&#151;would also run contrary to the provisions of the convention, so we could not possibly agree to its inclusion. It is possible to impose such a condition only in relation to hearing accused persons&#151;if member states choose, in accordance with Article 10(9), to extend the provision to hearing accused persons. The Government do not propose to enable accused persons to be heard in that way at all.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para15"></a>Subsection (3) gives the Secretary of State discretion not to take forward a request. That is the issue addressed by the third amendment in the group, Amendment No. 82. The point of having that discretion is to enable the Secretary of State not to comply with a request where that request would contravene national law. We consider that the approach in the Bill is preferable because it retains an overall discretion for the Secretary of State in all cases, while not being unduly prescriptive in the conditions that it imposes in relation to overseas requests. We consider that the discretion conferred on the Secretary of State in subsection (3) should be sufficient to meet the concerns that the second amendment seeks to address. In other words, he will be able to refuse requests if they do not contain the necessary information.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para16"></a>The Secretary of State will consider requests from EU countries on the basis of whether they conform to Article 10 of the Convention. If they do not&#151;that is, <P>


<a name="column_GC108"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC108</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>if there is no indication that it is undesirable or impossible for the witness to travel, and so on&#151;the Secretary of State can refuse to execute the request. In relation to non-EU requests, if an international agreement is in force, we will assist on the basis of its provisions; in the absence of an international agreement, the Secretary of State may exercise his discretion to assist. In those circumstances, he could impose conditions along the lines of those contained in the convention, for example, or, if appropriate in particular cases, more stringent requirements.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para17"></a>The fourth amendment, Amendment No. 83, would introduce a statutory requirement to inform witnesses of their rights and obligations as defined in the clause. It is hard not to be sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment. However, we consider that Schedule 2 contains sufficient safeguards regarding the rights of witnesses and think the amendment unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para18"></a>Witnesses who provide evidence in that way will be subject to the same rules on contempt of court and perjury as if they were testifying in a normal domestic court proceeding. They are also protected by any additional rights and privileges that they would have if physically present at the overseas proceeding.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para19"></a>The fifth amendment, Amendment No. 84, would limit the circumstances in which a witness summoned to give evidence before a UK court would be deemed to be in contempt of court. It is unacceptable because it would place an undue burden on the domestic court to have to establish whether an act by a witness in its presence that is contemptuous of court in the UK would also be in contempt of court in the overseas country. The Committee will understand that that would require detailed knowledge of many other legal systems, which is, frankly, impractical.
<P>

<a name="30123-31_para20"></a>The clause is designed to protect the domestic court system. After all, the overseas court will be conducting the proceedings. As I explained, it will be for it to establish whether anything that occurs at the UK hearing constitutes contempt for its purposes. We feel that that is a sufficient safeguard.

<A NAME="30123-31_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I thank my noble friend Lord Renton for his support for three of the five amendments. I certainly dare not return to the two that he did not support: Amendments Nos. 80 and 82; I shall take his advice on them. I am grateful to the Minister for giving such a full and helpful explanation in response to all the amendments. I was intrigued by his comment in passing on Amendment No. 81 that the Government had considered including paragraphs (a) and (b) in the Bill, but decided that that would be an unnecessary restriction. I shall reconsider that and may return to it on Report, but I do not want to commit myself at this stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30123-32_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 85:
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-32_para0"></a><P>

"( ) confirm that the witness has received independent legal advice"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-32_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: Schedule 2 does not ensure that evidence given by telephone is protected in the same way as evidence given by television links. One assumes that the difference is simply due to the fact that a witness cannot be compelled to give telephone evidence and that it is not admissible evidence in the United Kingdom. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the defendant has an opportunity to receive legal advice. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   The names of my noble friend Lord Dholakia and myself are attached to the amendment, but I shall speak also to Amendment No. 91A, which is in this group but which is in our names alone.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para2"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 91A is to ensure that someone who is giving evidence by television link in a court is entitled to receive legal advice in connection with his right to privilege. The arrangements for television link evidence are a little unclear. It is necessary under the Bill that they are given in a court. I assume that the court is more likely than not to consist of a district judge sitting in a magistrates' court&#151;it seems unlikely that it would go higher than that or that it would be heard by a lay magistrate.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para3"></a>The role of what I shall assume to be the district judge is very limited. The district judge sits there presiding while the television camera is on the face of the witness. There will obviously be a television screen in the court at the other end, from where the questions will be asked. The duties of the nominated court appear to be only to establish the identity of the witness, under paragraph 4 of Schedule 2, and to intervene where it considers that necessary to safeguard the rights of the witness, under Paragraph 5. Under Paragraph 9(1),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the witness cannot be compelled to give any evidence which he could not be compelled to give in criminal proceedings in the part of the United Kingdom in which the nominated court exercises jurisdiction".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-32_para4"></a>
That is directed primarily at the privilege against self-incrimination. I do not need to refer to the following sub-paragraphs.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para5"></a>The examination and cross-examination of the witness may&#151;more likely than not, will, where he or she comes from a non-English speaking country&#151;be carried out in a foreign language. Paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Rules of court . . . must make provision for the use of interpreters".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-32_para6"></a>
I find it unlikely that those rules are intended to ensure that all the questions put to and answers given by the witness must be translated for the benefit of a judge who has no possible interest in the substance of the case. If they must be translated, that will make the proceedings much more lengthy and expensive than necessary.
<P>


<a name="column_GC110"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para7"></a>On the other hand, if they are not translated, because the judge will not understand what is going on he will be unable to decide whether the witness is being asked a question that he or she is entitled to refuse to answer on grounds of the privilege against self-incrimination. In those circumstances, the witness ought at least to be given advance advice of what questions he or she might be asked but may be entitled to refuse to answer on grounds of self-incrimination. Otherwise, it is hard to see how those rights can be protected.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para8"></a>The whole question is rather difficult. It may be that translation is intended even in the case of, say, a Polish witness being examined and cross-examined in Polish, but I should like to know what is the position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I certainly understand the spirit and intent behind the amendments. The noble Baroness gave the game away when she referred to the defendant, when perhaps she meant the witness. I can see where she is coming from in saying that. I can foresee some of the difficulties that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has raised and shall try to cover them.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para9"></a>The first amendment, Amendment No. 85, would provide additional safeguards for witnesses being requested to provide evidence by telephone link. It would require the requesting authority to confirm that it had received independent legal advice agreeing to participate. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, gave a good exposition of the second amendment, Amendment No. 91A. It would provide additional safeguards by requiring rules of court to provide for legal advice to be given "where appropriate".
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para10"></a>Although we understand the desire to protect the rights of witnesses&#151;because that is what they are&#151;the Government believe the amendments to be unnecessary and that witnesses will have sufficient protection in any event. To go a step further than that, the amendments would introduce inconsistency between the assistance available to witnesses in domestic proceedings and those participating in foreign proceedings from a UK court.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para11"></a>If a person is summoned to appear as a witness in domestic proceedings, there is no obligation for that person to seek legal advice, as Amendment No. 85 suggests, nor is there an automatic right to legal advice regarding his or her rights, as suggested in Amendment No. 91A. It would not be right or consistent to require provision of legal advice in relation to appearing as a witness as part of overseas proceedings when the UK itself does not require or provide that in the domestic criminal context.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para12"></a>Under the Criminal Defence Service Regulations 2001, legal advice may be provided to a person who is a witness in criminal proceedings if he requires advice regarding self-incrimination. However, there is no general provision regarding access to legal advice for persons appearing as a witness in domestic proceedings and the court will not ordinarily inform people of those rights.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para13"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 85, the clause as drafted requires the requesting country to confirm that the witness is willing to give evidence by telephone in <P>


<a name="column_GC111"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proceedings before the overseas court, in accordance with Article 11(2) of the MLAC. As an additional safeguard, it requires the court to satisfy itself that the witness is willing. That provides protection to the witness if, having agreed to give evidence, he changes his mind by the time of the hearing. There is no question of issuing a summons to unwilling witnesses, because there is no power to summon witnesses in relation to telephone hearings.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para14"></a>The provision does not have general application. We do not expect it to be used frequently. In any event, not all member states are able to request this type of assistance. We understand that it is mainly used by Scandinavian countries.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para15"></a>In relation to the second amendment, the responsibility is on the court to ensure that the witness is not compelled to give any evidence which he could not be compelled to give in criminal proceedings in the UK. Paragraph 5 of Part 1 of the schedule provides that the court may intervene to safeguard the rights of the witness, so for example if the spouse of a suspect had been summoned to appear as a witness, the court could inform the witness that under domestic law they are not obliged to testify. So the court could play&#151;as one would expect in the United Kingdom context&#151;a more pro-active role.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para16"></a>We consider that the domestic court, which acts mainly as a facilitator in these hearings, will adequately fulfil the function of protecting the rights of the witness without introducing far more rigorous protections that apply to the thousands of witnesses who appear in our courts as part of domestic proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30123-32_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, raised the question of interpretation. The domestic court could intervene if a matter was not understood as it could view that as a necessary step to take to safeguard the rights of a witness. Translation will have to be audible to the judge. In many cases translation from, say, French to English will be advantageous for a witness. He or she will give evidence in the mother tongue in any event. In those circumstances the judge should be fully aware of all the questions. As the noble Lord rightly avers, the district judge in this instance will intervene if he thinks that it is right to do so.

<P>
<A NAME="30123-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Before the noble Baroness responds to those comments, I should say that I am pleasantly surprised by the noble Lord's reply. I had rather assumed that there would be no translation facilities available if a witness was being cross-examined in a foreign language which he understood perfectly well. I am pleased to hear that that is not the case. However, that process certainly involves considerably more time being taken up. As regards the more widely spoken European languages, is it contemplated that a panel of district judges might be sufficiently fluent in those <P>


<a name="column_GC112"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>languages to be able to sit as judges without having an interpreter present? I cannot see any legal objection to that in so far as this country's laws are concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   It is our expectation that the relevant proceedings would take place in English. Therefore, there would need to be translation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-32_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   But the proceedings surely could not take place in English. I refer to the examination of the witness and the witness's replies. If, as I said, a Polish witness was being examined by Polish lawyers, that process could not be undertaken in English. It would have to be translated for the benefit of the judge alone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Of course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-32_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for that full and helpful response. He correctly identified the fact that I had slipped up by calling the relevant person a defendant rather than a witness. I did so as I was thinking of the need to provide safeguards for witnesses who could conceivably become defendants in the circumstances we are discussing. Witnesses need to be aware of the likely implications of the evidence that they provide. I accept the explanations that the noble Lord has given but on Report we shall want to examine closely what protections might be necessary for witnesses in the circumstances we are discussing. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

 "The nominated court must be notified that the witness is willingly giving evidence by television link."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30123-33_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 86, I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 87, 88, 89, 91 and 92. These amendments are also concerned with protection for witnesses who give evidence by television link or telephone.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para2"></a>Amendment No. 86 simply imposes a requirement that the court that is nominated should be told that the witness is willingly giving evidence by television link. The anticipation is that if that assurance is not given the proceedings would not go ahead. Is that the case?
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para3"></a>Some protection is given to the witness in paragraph 5, to which the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, referred when speaking to Amendment No. 91A. That paragraph states that the nominated court may intervene where it considers it necessary to do so to safeguard the rights of the witness. We seek the Government's view on how far the court should have a role in safeguarding those rights. Amendment No. 87 would remove the discretion of the court to act in these circumstances and would require it to intervene. It is a tool for intervention.
<P>


<a name="column_GC113"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para4"></a>Paragraph 7 provides that the evidence will be taken in accordance with the laws of the country which has requested that television evidence should be given, but it also provides that the evidence will be subject to any measures the Secretary of State has agreed with the overseas country to protect the witness. Amendments Nos. 88 and 89 probe what approach will generally be taken by the Secretary of State in protecting witnesses.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para5"></a>Amendment No. 91 probes another aspect of the protection which should be afforded to witnesses by providing that the witness could not be forced to give evidence which he could not be compelled to give in criminal proceedings in the overseas country concerned.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para6"></a>Amendment No. 92 extends protection to witnesses giving evidence by telephone by requiring the court to intervene where it thinks it is necessary in order to protect the rights of the witness. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   As the noble Baroness said, Amendment No. 86 seeks to restrict the power of the court to secure the attendance of witnesses to circumstances where the witness is willing to attend. That is unacceptable for the reasons I gave in relation to the second amendment to Clause 30. The UK cannot restrict the application of these provisions to circumstances where witnesses are willing to give evidence because Article 10 of MLAC applies to all witnesses, not only willing ones. We consider that it is appropriate to have the power to compel witnesses to attend and that will be achieved by issuing a summons, as would be done if they were required to appear as a witness in a domestic criminal proceeding.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para7"></a>The noble Baroness explained that Amendment No. 87 is a tool for intervention. It seeks to replace a discretionary power of the court to intervene to protect the rights of the witness with an obligation to do so. While the Government understand the sentiment behind the amendment, we consider it unnecessary. As drafted, the court is granted a discretionary power to intervene, enabling it to do so if necessary. We have confidence that our courts will use that discretion. That seems entirely sufficient for the purposes of protecting witnesses.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para8"></a>The Government consider that Amendments Nos. 88 and 89 are inappropriately worded. Amending
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any measures for the protection of the witness"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-33_para9"></a>
to
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"those measures for the protection of the witness"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123-33_para10"></a>
could imply that such measures would be agreed in all cases. In practice it is unlikely to be necessary to arrange for protection of witnesses in all cases. We therefore consider the current drafting to be appropriate as it does not presuppose that such measures are always necessary.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para11"></a>Amendment No. 89 would require the Secretary of State to be satisfied that the overseas authority has the specified function. That seems to reflect an earlier proposed amendment to Clause 7, which we opposed on the basis that it would introduce an unacceptably high test for the domestic authority to meet. In the <P>


<a name="column_GC114"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column GC114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>context of Schedule 2, the Government consider that the current drafting has all the advantages of what we describe as "linguistic consistency" with that clause.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para12"></a>Amendment No. 92 would replicate the provisions of Part 1 of Schedule 2 regarding the intervention of the court to safeguard the rights of the witness, as set out in Part 2. Again, we do not consider it necessary or appropriate to include that provision. We also believe that it could have a confusing effect.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para13"></a>Under Clause 30 and Part 1 of the schedule, which govern television links, witnesses may be required to attend and are compellable, subject to the privileges in paragraph 9 of Part 1, which we have already discussed.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para14"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 91. The Government appreciate that the intention of the amendment is to protect witnesses from testifying where they would not be obliged to do so under the law of the requesting country. However, we consider that unnecessary and impractical. Again, it would place a high burden on our domestic courts if they had to examine the law of the requesting country in coming to that view. The right of a witness not to testify if he could not be compelled to do so under the law of the requesting country exists under that country's law. The domestic court involved in the hearing will not know all the details of the requesting country's legal system, nor the circumstances when witnesses could not be compelled to give evidence. We do not believe that it should be expected to do so.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para15"></a>I hope that those explanations satisfy the noble Baroness. If they do not, clearly we shall be able to pursue these matters further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123-33_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. As I said during debate on the previous group of amendments, I believe that on Report we shall need to return to issues concerning the protection of witnesses. I certainly appreciate some of the Minister's comments with regard to Amendments Nos. 88 and 89, and I doubt whether I shall wish to proceed with those.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para16"></a>I was intrigued with the Minister's response to Amendment No. 87. He commented that the amendment was perhaps unnecessary because we have confidence in our own courts to exercise a discretion in the right way. Indeed, like the noble Lord, I do have confidence in our courts. I believe that the difficulty is that they need to know when they should exercise a discretion. They are going into some fairly uncharted territory here.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para17"></a>Earlier, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, raised issues relating to the translation of proceedings. We may need to discuss that matter later but, at this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para21"></a>The noble Baroness said: In rising to move Amendment No. 90 and speak to Amendment No. 93, I am aware that it is an interesting fact that, as a result of the changes in procedures in both this House and another place, the Grand Committee sits for quite some time after the main Chambers have adjourned. However, be that as it may.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para22"></a>I tabled these amendments simply in order to obtain an assurance from the Minister that the Government will have regard to the needs of witnesses who are deaf or hard of hearing. The Minister will be aware that a substantial number of people in this country&#151;somewhere between 7 million and 8 million&#151;have hearing difficulties. One would assume that the proportion must be the same in other countries, too.
<P>

<a name="30123-33_para23"></a>As we have already discussed in debate on other amendments, the rules in Schedule 2 that cover the giving of evidence by telephone and television link refer to interpreters. My amendment simply asks the Government whether interpreters will include those who are competent in sign language or, indeed, in other forms of communication. It is obvious that that would be of benefit to those giving evidence by television. One would also need to know what measures were in place to assist those giving evidence by telephone. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30123-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I can be brief in responding on this matter. The term "interpreters", as it currently stands, is drafted in general terms and would include those competent in sign language. The provision is included to meet the requirement of Article 10 of the MLAC. In practice, domestic courts would always provide interpretation in the event of a <P>

<P>

<a name="30123-33_para24"></a>Therefore, sign language applies as well as verbal interpretation. Under the terms of Schedule 2, the rules of court must already make provision for the use of interpreters. We see no reason why the term "interpreters" should not include those competent in sign language. As I have always understood, signing must be a language all of its own and therefore I see no problem with that. However, we are grateful for the opportunity to clarify the situation. I believe that that will probably have been the last word from either of our two Houses this evening.

FCO officials summoned the DPRK charge d'affaires on 10 January to protest against recent actions by North Korea, and we continue to express our concerns to the DPRK Government via our ambassador in Pyongyang. Her Majesty's Government intend to remain engaged with North Korea; to maintain educational and human rights training programmes for North Korean officials; and to maintain humanitarian assistance to the people of North Korea. Technical assistance and trade promotion activities have been suspended until North Korea demonstrates a willingness to become a responsible member of the international community.

<A NAME="30123w01_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Desai  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many indemnity undertakings were given by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in respect of loss or damage to works of art loaned to the British Council for exhibitions overseas for the six-month period ended September 2002; and what was the value of contingent liabilities in respect of such undertakings which remained outstanding at that date.[HL1227]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123w01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  The British Council, although not a government department, receives a substantial grant-in-aid from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The council regularly organises or sponsors exhibitions overseas of works of art loaned from national galleries and private collections in the United Kingdom. It provides certain assurances or guarantees in respect of loss or damage while these works are on loan.
<P>

<a name="30123w01_para0"></a>In the six month period ended 30 September 2002, the British Council provided such assurances to seven national lenders and undertakings to 156 private lenders. The value of the contingent liabilities that remained outstanding as at 30 September 2002 in respect of national lenders was &#163;181,233,500 and &#163;158,734,660 in respect of private lenders; these were, for the most part, attributable to the Constable exhibition which opened in Paris on 7 October. The exhibition closed on 13 January 2003.

The person would be free to leave the UK if he wished to do so.
<P>

<a name="30123w01_para2"></a>The Court of Appeal unanimously upheld our position on the need for these detention powers last October. The court agreed that the detention powers are not discriminatory and comply with the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="30123w01_para3"></a>The draft Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (Continuance in force of sections 21&#150;23) Order 2003 provides for the continuation of the immigration powers under Part IV of the 2001 Act to certify, and to detain pending removal, suspected international terrorists, subject to safeguards. The continuation is from 14 March 2003 until 13 March 2004.
<P>

<a name="30123w01_para4"></a>Of the 15 foreign nationals who have so far been detained using the powers under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act, two have voluntarily left the United Kingdom. The other 13 remain in detention.
<P>

<a name="30123w01_para5"></a>The decisions of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary to certify and detain these individuals were made on the basis of detailed and compelling evidence. That evidence will be examined by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission when the individuals' appeals are held, as provided for under the Act. The commission is equivalent to the High Court. It has the power to overturn the certificates which the Home Secretary has issued in respect of those detained.
<P>

<a name="30123w01_para6"></a>The detention powers in Part IV of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act are a cornerstone of the UK's anti-terrorism measures. It is essential that we are able to take firm, swift action against those who threaten the safety of this country.

<P>
<UL> Which company has been selected as the prime contractor for the light forces anti-tank guided weapon.[HL1256]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   The Ministry of Defence has selected the Javelin weapon system, produced by a joint venture of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, as the preferred solution to the requirement for a new light forces anti-tank guided weapon (LF ATGW). This follows a rigorous and comprehensive assessment phase which included comparative live-firing trials between Javelin and the Spike system (offered by Rafael and MBDA). Taking all of these factors into account Javelin provides the best overall solution to our LF ATGW requirement in terms of risk, affordability, operational effectiveness and value for money.
<P>

<a name="30123w01_para7"></a>Javelin, which is already in service with the United States Army, will provide the British Army with a significantly improved capability when it replaces the existing Milan system. The weapon system is highly manoeuvrable and man-portable and is capable of destroying the most advanced tanks and armoured vehicles at ranges up to 2.5km.
<P>

<a name="30123w01_para8"></a>The contract, subject to satisfactory conclusion of negotiations, will be placed shortly. It will be worth over &#163;300 million and is expected to create or sustain over 300 jobs across the United Kingdom in a diverse range of manufacturing companies.

More recently, a non-representative survey of around 1,500 single homeless people who were in contact with agencies in one week in November 2002 found that a small minority of single homeless people had a forces background (5 per cent).

<A NAME="30123w02_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What discussions they have had with local authorities about the adequacy of provision of special schools in relation to parents' demand for places for children with special educational needs.[HL1094]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123w02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  Under Section 14(6)(b) of the Education Act 1996, local education authorities are under a duty to secure special education provision for pupils with special educational needs. The organisation of school provision in a local education authority area, including the balance between mainstream and special schools, is a matter for the authority itself. Proposals to make changes to school provision are decided by the local school organisation committee or, where they cannot agree, the school adjudicator. Officials do discuss provision in special schools with local authorities, in response to their requests for advice, where an Ofsted inspection shows that some aspects of an authority's arrangements for education are found to be inadequate or where an authority has failed to comply with the terms of a statement of special educational need.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para0"></a>The Government believe that special schools play a vital role in supporting pupils with special educational needs. However, it is also important that local authorities and the schools themselves recognise that that role is changing and needs to become more outwardly-focused to reflect the general principle in the SEN code of practice that the special educational needs of pupils will normally be met in mainstream schools or settings. Last summer I commissioned a sub-group of the Ministerial SEN Working Group to advise me on how the role of special schools might develop within this inclusive framework. I am due to receive that report shortly and will ensure that the noble Lord receives a copy.

This compares with 1,274 and 78 respectively in 1992. Since January 2002, 16 special schools have closed, 17 special schools are proposed to close and 18 special schools have opened. In addition to maintained and non-maintained special schools, there are currently 225 independent schools where the register consists mainly or wholly of pupils with special educational needs (SEN).

<P>

<a name="30123w02_para8"></a>Since the end of the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak animal movement controls have been in place, underpinned by a 20-day standstill period for premises following the arrival of incoming animals. These controls were imposed on the basis of strong veterinary and scientific advice.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para9"></a>There have been successive relaxations and exemptions from the 20-day regime in England and Wales and separately in Scotland, notably a system of isolation or separation for incoming animals, in order to meet industry concerns about the costs imposed by the standstill rule.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para10"></a>Recommendations of the Independent Inquiries
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para11"></a>The two independent inquiries into FMD&#151;the Lessons Learned and Royal Society inquiries&#151;reporting in July 2002 endorsed the retention of the  20-day standstill on disease control grounds until such time as the Government had carried out a detailed risk assessment and wide-ranging cost-benefit analysis of the impact of different standstill periods.

<a name="30123w02_para15"></a>Separately Defra had already commissioned a risk assessment of the probability of disease reaching GB livestock either from illegal imports or from meat imported legally from third countries; emerging results from that risk assessment were also relevant to this work.

<FONT SIZE=3>movement regime for spring 2003 because of the significant numbers of animal movements that take place at that time of year.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para17"></a>Emerging Findings from the Risk Assessments
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para18"></a>These risk assessment and cost-benefit studies have been tackling novel and complex problems in a relatively short time. The emerging findings do not provide unequivocal answers to the questions posed.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para19"></a>Nonetheless, on animal movements the risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis provide evidence for four conclusions. First, they suggest that standstill rules can play a useful part in limiting the spread of foot and mouth disease during the period before its presence in the country has been identified. Secondly, however, initial disease spread is likely to be dominated by early animal movements over which standstills have limited impact and by other spread mechanisms which they do not affect. Standstills therefore appear to have rather less effect than might have been anticipated in confining outbreaks to local areas. Thirdly, in disease spread terms, in the majority of scenarios the differential benefit between a six and a 20-day standstill is relatively small and in cost-benefit terms a six-day standstill is more effective in most (but not all) scenarios. And fourthly and perhaps most important, the model shows that the key factor affecting the ultimate scale of an outbreak is the time to detection of disease, not the length of standstill.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para20"></a>The Government's Conclusions
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para21"></a>The Government's veterinary and scientific advisers do not consider that the currently emerging conclusions from the movements risk assessment are sufficiently robust definitively to determine the optimum length of standstill period. However, the balance of view of the experts in risk assessment is that, while the second phase of the risk assessment work should continue to the end of May 2003 as planned, there is unlikely to be a significantly better basis on which to make a decision about the standstill then than is available now. The Government therefore are faced with making a decision now on the evidence available to them balancing scientific, veterinary, economic and other factors.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para22"></a>The Government consider in the light of the evidence that a standstill period provides a valuable long-term element in the movement regime. The emerging results from the cost-benefit analysis suggest a reasonably robust cost-benefit case for a six-day standstill (compared with no standstill). But, bearing in mind the uncertainties on the movements risk assessment, the emerging results cannot at this stage provide a robust conclusion on whether or not the economic benefits of 20-day standstill (net of costs) are greater, or less, than for six days. The results do however strongly indicate that it is equally important to address factors such as disease surveillance, biosecurity standards on farms, in markets and in the transport of livestock, and above all efforts to raise awareness and commitment in the livestock community to reporting suspicion of disease.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para23"></a>It is recognised that an early move to reduce the standstill from 20 to six days would carry some risks. <P>


<a name="column_WA122"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column WA122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, the Government have concluded that the best approach is to put in place a standstill of six days for cattle, sheep and goats with effect from early March, provided that over the next couple of weeks the industry demonstrates a commitment to an effective programme of controls and further work to improve disease detection and biosecurity. If we are to go beyond the most precautionary approach, there must be a real gain to be had from doing so. The 20-day standstill will remain in place for pigs.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para24"></a>Measures to Improve Disease Detection and Biosecurity
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para25"></a>The change Ministers are announcing today is therefore dependent on the adoption of an accompanying package of measures by early March, the main points of which are:
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para26"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>a responsibility will be placed on lorry drivers, farmers and others to ensure that they, and the exterior of their vehicles, are clean when entering livestock markets;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123w02_para27"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>livestock market operators will be required to sign a formal undertaking to comply with strict operating procedures;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123w02_para28"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>there will have to be complete separation in time and space between dedicated slaughter markets and other livestock markets.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123w02_para29"></a>At the same time, most of the additional controls over the cleansing and disinfection of livestock vehicles introduced following the FMD outbreak will be maintained and the current requirements for standards of biosecurity in markets will be maintained and kept under review. The Government are also introducing new rules for the individual identification of sheep and goats from 1 February.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para30"></a>The Government will also tackle non-compliance more systematically by removing farmers' right to move animals under general licence if they break the rules; and put in place a joint campaign with the industry to promote high levels of compliance and accepted tough treatment of those breaking the rules.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para31"></a>The Government will consult on the following proposals for possible introduction later in the year:
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para32"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>the introduction of revised FMD biosecurity guidance by 1 July 2003, as required under the Animal Health Act 2002;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123w02_para33"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>a ban on animals being kept on market premises overnight;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123w02_para34"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>a requirement for all vehicles to be cleansed and disinfected before leaving markets and abattoirs;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123w02_para35"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>a requirement for market operators to ensure that a vet attends every market;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123w02_para36"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>a requirement for farmers to consult a vet at least annually for advice about disease detection, biosecurity and farm health plans.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30123w02_para37"></a>The Government will commission further work into the impact of dealers on the pattern of livestock movements and the options for controls; and the possibility of imposing a distance limit of (say) 150km on the movement of animals through markets or of making such moves subject to special licences.
<P>


<a name="column_WA123"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column WA123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para38"></a>In addition, government will work with industry, the veterinary profession and farm assurance schemes on a package of education and best practice guidance, covering in particular the recognition and reporting of disease and the encouragement of farm health plans covering disease surveillance, biosecurity and movement records.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para39"></a>There would also need to be a commitment that the industry will engage constructively in consultations on the delivery of the animal health and welfare strategy and on future systems of risk sharing between government and the industry of the costs of animal disease.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para40"></a>At the same time, the Government recognise the need to maintain and enhance their efforts to minimise the risk of an FMD outbreak posed by illegal imports of meat and animal products, building on the illegal imports action plan and the conclusions of the risk assessment on illegal imports. We intend to consult further with stakeholders on a revised and updated version of the action plan.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para41"></a>Return to the 20-day Standstill if Risk Increases
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para42"></a>The Government will also put in place arrangements&#151;along the lines recommended by the Royal Society Report&#151;for triggering a 20-day standstill should the threat of disease increase or the evidence base otherwise changes so as to justify a longer standstill, or if there is significant non-compliance with the new or existing biosecurity provisions. The regulations setting out the move to a six-day standstill will have an expiry date of 31 July 2003, so that the position can be reviewed at the end of May.
<P>

<a name="30123w02_para43"></a>The Government are publishing a summary document describing the emerging findings from the risk assessments and cost-benefit analysis and the advice we have received on them from peer reviewers and from our veterinary, scientific and economic advisers. It will also set out more fully the proposed new measures on detection and biosecurity. Detailed reports on the risk assessments from the external contractors will be published within the next couple of weeks when quality assurance is complete.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="30123w03_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Hoyle </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
What proposals they have for a new framework of measures to improve rewards for National Health Service consultants and modernise medical careers in England.[HL1257]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123w03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health is today announcing proposals for a new framework of measures to improve rewards for National Health Service consultants and modernise medical careers in England. Copies of the proposed new framework have been placed in the Printed Paper Office.
<P>


<a name="column_WA124"></a>

<B>23 Jan 2003 : Column WA124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30123w03_para0"></a>The new framework involves using the extra resources that the Department of Health had previously set aside for implementation of a new consultants' contract (rising to some &#163;250 million by 2005&#150;06) to achieve the continued objective of giving greater rewards to consultants who do most for NHS patients and reforming the way the NHS delivers patient care.
<P>

<a name="30123w03_para1"></a>To ensure that this extra investment delivers improvements in NHS consultant capacity, productivity and value for money&#151;and helps reform ways of working&#151;there will be a national framework within which local health services will have a choice of investing in local implementation of the contract negotiated with the British Medical Association in June 2002, where there is a high level of local consultant support; investing in new annual incentives for consultants who make the biggest contribution to improving patient care; and investing extra resources in the new system of clinical excellence awards that is due to be introduced from April 2004.
<P>

<a name="30123w03_para2"></a>Within this framework, NHS trusts, primary care trusts and strategic health authorities will be asked to deploy the available resources in ways that most effectively support local priorities for improving the efficiency, quality and responsiveness of patient care.
<P>

<a name="30123w03_para3"></a>The new framework will be accompanied by new standards for consultant job planning to help provide more varied and flexible medical careers and a more productive, collaborative approach to planning and reviewing consultants' work for the NHS. There will also be new standards governing the relationship between private practice and NHS work to improve transparency and prevent any potential conflicts of interest. Consultants will need to meet these standards to be eligible for the new incentive payments and to demonstrate that they are meeting the standards expected under the new clinical excellence award scheme.
<P>

<a name="30123w03_para4"></a>In line with the objective of supporting medical careers, the department will be introducing on a phased basis a new system of sabbaticals for consultants. Initially, by 2005&#150;06 funding will be made available to enable around 800 consultants each year to have sabbaticals of around two to three months, with coverage extending as workforce capacity expands.
<P>

<a name="30123w03_para5"></a>The department will also be working closely with the medical royal colleges to modernise medical training, recruitment and career structures. Reforming medical careers in this way will help deliver in a more effective way the treatment patients need most and enable doctors to develop their skills to the full.

<UL><FONT SIZE=3>that are sometimes additionally required in order that teachers trained in the United Kingdom can teach in the Irish Republic.[HL1166]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30123w03_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  Teachers in primary schools, second level teachers in Gaeltacht schools and teachers who are required to teach through the medium of Irish must satisfy the Department of Education and Science in the Republic of Ireland that they are competent to teach the Irish language before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. Teachers trained in any other member state of the European Union whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by the Department of Education and Science in the Republic of Ireland but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification are granted a five-year period of provisional recognition to teach in national schools.
<P>

<a name="30123w03_para6"></a>Applicants for posts in voluntary secondary schools whose teacher training courses have not adequately covered the history and structure of the Irish education system aspect are required by the registration council to study for and undertake a written examination.
<P>

<a name="30123w03_para7"></a>The Joint Teacher Qualifications Working Group, established under the Belfast agreement, is examining the issue of teacher qualification, including the issue of additional fees, in the context of teacher mobility. The issue will also be considered by the General Teaching Councils for Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, together with representatives of the Republic of Ireland (which is still in the process of establishing its GTC).

<FONT SIZE=3>instruct voters to vote once for their first choice and once for their second choice at the mayoral election.
<P>

<a name="30123w03_para8"></a>The consultation paper Changes to the Rules for London Mayoral and Assembly Elections includes a proposal to replace the prescribed text for these notices with a set of criteria governing what the notices should and should not include. Within those criteria, the Greater London returning officer would specify the wording and design of the notices, including what they should say about exercising first and second choice votes.
<P>

<a name="30123w03_para9"></a>After the consultation closes on 10 March, the Government will analyse the responses and decide whether and how to take this proposal forward.
