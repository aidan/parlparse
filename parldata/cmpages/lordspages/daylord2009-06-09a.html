We are working closely with the Commission and the UK industry to minimise the impact of these regulations. We have already secured significant beneficial changes, such as a two-year delay in implementation and the phasing in of individual recording.</p>

We have been well engaged with the industry and we work hard with it to get appropriate derogations and variations. I accept that this regulation is probably, on balance, not a good idea. It will create more costs than benefits in most of the industry. Nevertheless, those costs have been significantly reduced by our negotiations.

The modest benefits of the scheme are traceability in the event of a foot and mouth outbreak and the likelihood of reducing the cost of such an outbreak by between 3 and 13 per cent. As monitoring becomes widespread, some businesses will find benefits in better flock management and monitoring of breed performance.</p>

I do not know whether the Minister is aware of this, but the average net income for a sheep farmer in the United Kingdom is about &#163;8,000 per year. The estimated cost of one of these electronic tag readers is about &#163;8,000. Who will pay this cost and the additional costs that will be imposed not only on farmers but on livestock markets and abattoirs? Will the Minister assure us that this regulation and a compulsory scheme will not be foisted on the United Kingdom?</p>

I am aware that sheep farmers have modest incomes. The cost per animal is likely to be about &#163;1. The cost of readers is likely to be &#163;400, not &#163;8,000. The potential full cost is &#163;50 million. The slaughter derogation that we already have will reduce this, if accepted by the Community, to some &#163;20 million and, if we go to critical control point, that will reduce it to something like &#163;12 million. So while it is an additional cost, it is modest compared with the overall size of the market, which is worth &#163;650-plus million, perhaps approaching &#163;800 million or &#163;900 million in the present good years.</p>

This scheme is nonsensical. It is totally impractical and cannot work. As we have heard, its cost is high, which is a problem for the sheep industry, although the industry is doing a little better now than it has been. Can the Minister tell me how on earth you get 5,000 sheep off a hill to identify them electronically without leaving 30, 40 or 50 behind the bracken on top of the hill? A compulsory scheme is nonsense. Surely the Government can consider a derogation that will help the whole sheep industry.</p>

Equally, my knowledge of getting sheep off a hill is pretty thin. However, I have gone through this with great care and I am totally convinced that it is practicable, given the derogations and variations that we have sought. The slaughter derogation, which means that stock under 12 months going directly to slaughter are derogated out of the scheme, and the critical control points system, which we are putting forward to the industry and which we hope to be able to negotiate with Europe, would move the paperwork away from the breeder to the slaughterhouses and markets. These matters are still in consultation. There is a consultation running now with our own industry, with which we will be having further discussions, but we are working very hard to make the scheme practical.</p>

Prison rules are legally binding; they are made up of statutory instruments. Prison Service orders are not themselves legally binding, just as any organisation&#146;s internal instructions are not legally binding, although I believe that Prison Service orders go through Ministers.</p>

So far as concerns the reports of the treatment of prisoners with disabilities&#151;I think that she is referring to Parkhurst&#151;that particular PSO is currently under review as part of the work following the publication of the NOMS single equality scheme.

However, rather than adding a rapporteur to the existing responsibilities in the field of eliminating violence against women and all forms of discrimination, we believe that the establishment of the United Nations agency that is being proposed, with the officer possibly at Under-Secretary-General level, is the right way to tackle this. There are already two people, in the committee and a person, in those roles. What we need is an overarching committee, which is suitably staffed at a high level. We are therefore not persuaded that an additional rapporteur is the answer to the UN&#146;s position.</p>

It will not surprise the House to learn that the rapporteur is a proposal from the French, from President Sarkozy.

The United Kingdom was the first country to bring many things that are now being dealt with, such as violence, into the public domain. Since then, a great deal has been done in many countries, but there is still a conflict in getting the other countries which have different views on the subject to go along with the recommendations.

She will also appreciate, as does the whole House, that the present situation is fraught with danger. There are difficulties over the existence of the ceasefire following the three-week intervention a few months ago, and the situation is very challenging.

This is not just a question of a further extension of settlements, but of how to handle the existing ones that lie on what will be Palestinian land.

The noble Lord is all too well aware, as is the whole House, that the present Administration in Israel is dependent on parties which are committed not just to maintenance of the settlements, but to their extension.

They are essentially custodians of scholarship, intellectual rigour and world-class teaching. Where will his priorities come in his department? He is going to have to save Vauxhall, which will cost hundreds of millions of pounds. Do the universities come before, alongside or after Vauxhall? The Prime Minister said that there are 13 priorities for his department. Universities are fifth,

Last week, at Second Reading, the Bill was introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, who is not a Minister of his department. She is involved in education and children in the department of his close and now recent friend Mr Balls, so a Minister from another department is carrying through major legislation for his department. Where is the join-up? Who is in charge of this rattling train? May I ask one personal question before I sit down? I see that he has become Lord President of the Council.

However, I am not sure that the Secretary of State has provided a philosophy for the merger of higher and further education with the rest of the departments. I go further and suggest, perhaps in the interests of creative facetiousness, that we might look forward to further mergers, such as a merger of the Exchequer with health.</p>

These amendments involve property owners in business improvement districts in areas where a business rate supplement is in place. I think that it would be helpful if I were to give a little bit of background first, so that noble Lords can consider the amendments in context.</p>

<a name="90609-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="090609115000002"></a>One of the recurring themes during the passage of the Bill in this House and the other place has been the important relationship between BRS and BIDs. The  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_532"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 532</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>debates in both Houses have underlined the strong support for BIDs. There is a genuine desire across all parties that BIDs should continue to thrive after the introduction of BRS. I understand that one of the main concerns of practitioners of BIDs and business supporters is that, if BID levy payers are faced with a BRS on top of any existing levy, ratepayers may be inclined to vote against proposals when they come up for renewal. Fourteen out of the existing 20 BIDs in London are due for renewal ballots by 2012, so there is real concern that the introduction of BRS could have a negative impact on existing and future BIDs.</p>

<a name="90609-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="090609115000003"></a>As a response to these concerns, Nick Raynsford, the right honourable Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, tabled amendments during the Committee and Report stages of the Bill in the other place to strengthen the role of property owners in BIDs and to enable the contributions to the BID to be spread between occupiers and owners, providing an effective offset for occupiers against their BRS liability. Under the current BID arrangements, property owners may make voluntary contributions to BIDs, but they are not entitled to vote in a BID ballot and there is no way of ensuring that, if some property owners in an area make voluntary contributions, others do as well.</p>

<a name="90609-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="090609115000004"></a>On 18 May, the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, tabled amendments in Grand Committee on the same issue. The purpose of those amendments was to enable BID proposers or companies to decide whether property owners should be involved in, and have a chance to vote on, BID proposals for an area. It became obvious from the debates in Grand Committee that this is not a new idea. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, who is in his place, for reminding the House that the issue of property owner involvement not only arose during the passage of the Local Government Act 2003&#151;the Act that sets the framework for the current BIDs system&#151;but also featured in a Private Member&#146;s Bill that he introduced in 1997.</p>

<a name="90609-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="090609115000005"></a>The amendments that I will move today deal with the same broad issues that featured in the earlier amendments tabled by Nick Raynsford in the other place and by the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine. The amendments make arrangements for a new type of BID, to be known as a BRS BID. This is to distinguish it from the current BID arrangements. This new type of BID could be established in areas where both a BID and BRS exist and would allow for the owners of property to be involved in BID arrangements. It will be for those proposing BIDs or existing BID companies to decide whether they wish to involve property owners in their BID arrangements&#151;I emphasise that it will not be compulsory.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90609-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90609-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="090609115000006"></a>A BRS BID could fund the same project as the main BID. Revenues from property owners could be used as additional income for the BID project or they could be used to offset the contributions of those ratepayers who are liable for both the BID levy and the BRS. Alternatively, the revenue stream from property owners could be used to fund a different project, quite separate from the BID project. As is the case for BIDs under the current arrangements, it will not be possible for a BRS BID to be established unless there has been a successful ballot on the proposals.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_533"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 533</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90609-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="090609115000007"></a>I am sure that the House will appreciate that these amendments are not quite the end of the story. Involving property owners in BIDs raises a number of complex issues. That is why the new schedule contains a number of powers that will allow the Government to include the detail on the BRS BIDs in secondary legislation. The regulations will deal with issues such as who should be considered a property owner, how the rateable value of non-domestic properties should be attributed to property owners for the purposes of the double-lock ballot, and the detailed arrangements for ballots.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="090609115000008"></a>In addition, I noted from Grand Committee that the noble Lord, Lord Bates, raised concerns regarding possible cost-shunting between owners and tenants, a concern that the Government share. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, when moving her amendment in Grand Committee on the involvement of property owners in BIDs, said that she thought that this would not be a significant risk. Her view was based on the experience of property owners making voluntary contributions under the existing BID arrangements, which she did not feel there was a need to address in the Bill. While I am encouraged by her experience on this issue in the context of voluntary property owner contributions, I recognise that there is some disquiet on the matter. As such, it would have been irresponsible of us as a Government to ignore these concerns. We have therefore taken a regulation-making power in the new schedule so that we can address the issue through secondary legislation if the need arises.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="090609115000009"></a>The amendment to Clause 29 provides that several of the powers in the new schedule will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. This covers the important issues&#151;for example, the rules on ballots and how votes may be weighted. We will of course engage closely with stakeholders as we develop our proposals for secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="090609115000010"></a>There is one specific point that I should raise before I conclude. I have already said that these amendments can apply only in those areas where a BRS is in place. I understand that there was a debate in Grand Committee about whether it would be possible to extend these provisions to BIDs in all areas. It might be helpful to clarify the position on that. We have pursued this matter with the Lords Public Bill Office, which has confirmed that amendments dealing with the inclusion of property owners in BIDs outside a BRS area would not be possible. The term that the Public Bill Office uses is whether an amendment would be &#147;relevant&#148;. The BRS Bill has a single purpose, which is to introduce the BRS scheme. The Bill refers to BIDs, but only to the extent that they are affected by the introduction of BRS. However, any stand-alone amendments to the BIDs regime unconnected to the introduction of BRS would not be considered &#147;relevant&#148;.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="090609115000011"></a>I hope that, with that explanation and with the amendments that I have brought forward, the House will feel that it is able to support the changes that we have made. Accordingly, I beg to move.</p>

Waiting for this part of the proceedings in the House to start, I saw that he was responsible for answering two Questions on foreign affairs. He has a vast amount of responsibility, so I am full of admiration for the way in which he has grasped the complex detail of this piece of legislation and I am grateful for the way in which he has taken us through it.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="090609115000013"></a>As the Minister mentioned, this amendment is a response to one tabled in Committee by the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, to which my name was also attached on behalf of these Benches. We support this endeavour. I join the Minister in paying tribute to my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding, who has continuously played a significant role not only in the development of business improvement districts as a concept but also in fusing together how the business rate supplement, as proposed, would fit in with what is being discussed.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="090609115000014"></a>We had a vigorous debate in Committee. It is perhaps most striking that, when the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, accepted the proposal in Committee, it took two lines in about two pages of debate, yet these amendments run to some six pages in the schedule. A significant amount of a parliamentary draftsperson&#146;s time has gone into putting this together. I do not want to be uncharitable, given that this is a concession from the Government, but tabling such a lengthy amendment and schedule at such a late stage in the process has made it quite difficult for people to get to grips with this and how it will work on the ground. We reserve the right to come back at Third Reading to look at it in more detail.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="090609115000015"></a>We are dealing with a great many regulation-making powers. As this has not been built into primary legislation, we would like reassurances about when it might come in. It is crucial that it is brought in as soon as possible because the BRS Bill will soon be an Act&#151;sadly, from our point of view. Business improvement districts and property owners who want to contribute in this way need that protection as soon as possible. Can the Minister clarify those points? I give notice that we will touch on this at Third Reading.</p>

As the Minister pointed out, these measures are of particular relevance and importance in London, although not with my council. Also, I have been asked to give the apologies of my noble friend Lady Hamwee. Like everyone else, she was not expecting to be here this afternoon and unfortunately has an unbreakable commitment outside London. I know that she is deeply sorry not to be with us for these continuing proceedings, although that gives me the chance to speak on this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="090609115000017"></a>I welcome these proposals as far as they go. Following on from the noble Lord, Lord Bates, we understand the reasons why they have been tabled late in the day, but we have had relatively short notice of what are complex provisions. I am grateful to the Minister for his careful explanation. Would he consider not moving these amendments today but bringing them back at Third Reading? That would give people&#151;particularly those outside this Chamber, ourselves and those who

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="090609115000020"></a>I ask the Minister seriously to consider my suggestion, not because we are opposed to this proposal&#151;I am sure that we will not be; indeed, I welcome it&#151;but because it would allow more time for understanding and consideration and would be a better way of bringing back any further questions and points that might be necessary next week.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="090609115000021"></a>The Minister explained carefully why it is possible under the Long Title to apply the amendment only to those areas with BIDs that will have a business rate supplement. We have to accept that limitation but, as the Government have now accepted the wider principle, it would be helpful to know what they will do&#151;and when will they do it&#151;to cover that wider principle for areas that are not currently covered by the Bill.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="090609115000022"></a>I have a few other, more detailed questions, which I will ask in the expectation of a reply not so much today as when the amendment is moved again at Third Reading, as I hope will be the case. Does paragraph 2(5) of the proposed new schedule restrict local discretion in terms of offsetting? Does paragraph 5(7) mean that, if an owner and an occupier vote, the rateable value is double for the purpose of the double-lock ballot? Can the Minister confirm that paragraph 6(4) requires a precise mathematical calculation and that the rating is not arbitrary or discretionary? In paragraph 7(2) on the regulations prescribing matters relevant to the veto, will this exactly replicate the veto arrangements provided by Section 51 of the Local Government Act 2003?</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="090609115000023"></a>Perhaps asking those questions illustrates why it is a good idea not to continue to deal with the amendments today but for the Minister to move them at Third Reading and come back with the answers to those questions if he is not able to do so today. We welcome the amendment, despite the late stage of the Bill.</p>

Yes, we have been arguing this case for some time. However, by arguing the very simple proposition that owners as well as occupiers should be entitled to take part in a BID&#151;something which appears to have been achieved by one and a half lines of print in the proposed new schedule under paragraph 2(6)&#151;we are faced, as my noble friend Lord Bates said, with more than six pages of print in the amendment. I was quite shocked when I saw how much this involved and immediately sought advice. I am sure that Ministers who have been in this position before will recognise that if an amendment is tabled late one week with a view to being debated on the

I am sure that I am not the only one who fired off a lot of e-mails and left telephone messages to try to find out what happened.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="090609116000002"></a>I declare an interest as a joint president of London Councils; indeed, I was presiding at its annual general meeting this morning. The Minister will recognise that we have here in London a two-tier system for BRS. The levying authority will of course be the Greater London Authority, with the express purpose, as has been said throughout the Bill&#146;s passage, of getting a substantial business contribution towards the Crossrail project. The authority is the levying authority but the boroughs will be the billing authority, and it is very important to draw the distinction between those two functions. It is the London boroughs, represented by London Councils, that are now expressing considerable anxieties about this amendment because of its apparent complexity and, in some cases, obscurity. I bow to the expertise of the noble Lord, Lord Tope, in being able to identify a series of specific questions. However, I discussed this matter this morning with members and officials in London Councils, and they are faced with a considerable problem. This amendment imposes on them as the billing authorities a whole new range of functions and duties once the Greater London Authority, in the person of the mayor, has decided to levy a BRS. That is what is causing me some anxiety.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="090609116000003"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Bates, I think that the proposal put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, is a good one. During the morning I have been thinking: if the amendment goes into the Bill now, how can we bring the Bill back on Third Reading without in fact tabling more amendments? Perhaps we will want to table amendments, but it is too early to say. The experts in London Councils are busily poring over this to see how it will work. The question they asked me this morning&#151;I could not answer them&#151;was how it is intended to work. One only needs to look through, as I have been doing at the weekend and more recently, the complexities of all the paragraphs in this new schedule. I cannot answer the question of how it will work. I am not sure that I am any the wiser this afternoon despite the Minister&#146;s very patient explanation of what it is about. He told us what it is intended to achieve but he has not been able to tell us&#151;in the time available, as we are anxious to get on to other things&#151;how it will work.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="090609116000004"></a>I believe that we have a date pencilled in for Third Reading. However, I really do ask that we should have enough time with all the various bodies. That includes not only London Councils. The British Property Federation is an obvious body to consult. The Greater London Authority is clearly involved, because it is relying on the London boroughs as the billing authorities. I have also been in touch with various other bodies. These bodies have been overwhelmed trying to grapple with this very substantial schedule in a few days over the weekend when people were not in the office. The boroughs will inevitably act as pathfinders on these provisions, because once the Bill gains Royal Assent and the mayor has made his proposal for a BRS, it is the boroughs that will be under the time pressures to  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_537"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 537</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bring the legislation into effect. Even at first sight, they said that they will be very hard-pressed indeed to get the new systems and software in place to meet the deadlines. The addition of these provisions adds to the uncertainty and threat of delays in an already very tight schedule.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="090609116000006"></a>I therefore ask the Minister&#151;this might be something that we will need to come back to in more detail on Third Reading&#151;whether he can give an undertaking that this will not extend the time limit or add extra time and cost burdens for the London boroughs acting as billing authorities. I was told this morning that London Councils has been in touch with the Scottish and London BIDs, which have told him that it is not straightforward to consult owners. I have said ever since I introduced the original Private Member&#146;s Bill that I think that it is right that there should be an option to bring in owners. However, I have been told by those who will have to operate this scheme&#151;namely the billing authorities&#151;that this is not wholly straightforward. Suddenly to be confronted, as they were late last week, with this substantial, six-page government amendment, in order to achieve this one little change adding owners to occupiers for the purposes of a BID, makes them feel very hard done by. The Minister needs to recognise that.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="090609116000007"></a>I have sought to defend the proposal on the grounds that we wanted the option of adding owners to occupiers in BIDs. However, I could not possibly have anticipated that it would take six pages of legislation which was presented to this House less than a week&#151;indeed, five days&#151;before we were expected to debate it. This is not the way to legislate.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="090609116000008"></a>The Minister made it perfectly clear in Grand Committee that the Government have been minded to do this since Nick Raynsford moved the amendment in another place. Therefore, there seems to have been an astonishing dilatoriness in getting the amendment before this House. In those circumstances, I support the suggestion that the Minister might feel it right not to press the amendment on Report today but to re-table it, perhaps in the light of discussions that he and his officials may have over the next few days with, for instance, London Councils, so that we might consider it within a reasonable timescale and add it to the Bill before it receives Royal Assent. That is the least that we can ask in the circumstances.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="090609116000009"></a>I apologise if I appear to be overcritical but, having been faced this morning with the anxiety of London Councils&#151;of which the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, and I are the joint presidents&#151;I feel it right that we should represent to the House the very real anxieties that it feels about the administration of this complex schedule. I hope the Minister will be able to respond to the valuable suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Tope, so as to give us more time to consider these details.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="090609116000011"></a>Arising out of that admiration, I would not think that anybody who has taken part so far in our proceedings on Report would not regard it as totally reasonable for the Minister to take this proposal away at this juncture. I cannot help feeling that the quality of the Bill would be better if he, like me, had a little more time to grapple with the issues.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Bates, indicated when he first spoke, we are giving effect, in principle, to strong positions adopted in Committee and amendments that were tabled then. I think the noble Lord, Lord Tope, was also prepared to recognise this, as of course was the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. The amendments followed those that were tabled in the other place. The Government have accepted the principle proposed by these amendments. The Committee stage was over a week away. We tabled these amendments last Tuesday.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="090609119000002"></a>I sympathise with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, about the difficulties, in opposition, of responding to government legislation. It is a little while since I was last in opposition, and may years go by before I experience opposition again. From the dim and distant past I have a memory of the difficulties of responding to government legislation, but it as not as though the Government are involved in some sleight of hand to advance government policy against the wishes of the House&#151;far from it. The Government are responding to pressure from the House, and tabled amendments, to adopt this principle. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, if giving effect to a simple principle involves a fairly substantial schedule. That is the way of the world, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, knows rather better than I do, particularly with regard to local government. He will forgive me if I am not too exercised about that. I respect the anxieties of noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="090609119000003"></a>I make the obvious point. If noble Lords are saying that they may feel obliged to raise the issue again at Third Reading if the Government press ahead today, I am modest enough to think that it probably does not matter what I say at the Dispatch Box at present. Third Reading beckons and so, no doubt, do a few amendments, as they should if noble Lords are anxious. It is right that the Government should respond to pressure from the Committee in the passage of the Bill. It is also right that I should protect the timetable for the Bill. There is nothing exceptional about the timetable. We are following Report stage, after Committee stage, for the proper duration. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, knows only too well that Third Reading will take place at its duly appointed time.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="090609119000004"></a>I understand the anxiety of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, about the mechanics, problems and burdens of implementation. If he asks me to give some assurance that there will be no burdens, of course I cannot do so.  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_539"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 539</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Of course such legislation imposes burdens on local authorities as billing agents. I recognise the validity of his point that, where local authorities are merely the billing agents, rather than the developers of policy, they may have rather more reservations because they have no direct say in resource allocation. That is true of local authorities in many instances, whether they are involved in billing arrangements for a superior authority or not. As an issue of principle, it is built into local government structures.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="090609119000005"></a>What can I say to noble Lords? I am not prepared to withdraw the amendments because we have not broken any issue of timetable. The principle behind these amendments is not only accepted in the House. The Government were persuaded of the principle and not the other way around. In responding as we have&#151;on Report, at the proper stage&#151;we are only fulfilling our duty. I understand that we will sustain a risk and I will enjoy the debate that I probably have to look forward to at Third Reading, when some anxieties may still be expressed on this matter. I am not prepared to withdraw amendments that are in line with what I detect the House to support in principle, and to which the Government are, in principle, giving effect.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="090609119000006"></a>A great deal of the noble Lord&#146;s anxieties concern the mechanics of implementation. I agree with him that it is important that local authorities should have a full understanding of how the provision is meant to work. My department will give its fullest support to local authorities in working through these issues. However, we are not talking about implementation next week. The Bill must proceed to Third Reading, be considered further by the Commons and receive Royal Assent. The noble Lords, Lord Tope and Lord Bates, referred to regulations. We hope to deliver these in the autumn. However, that timetable is conditional on the fullest consultation with those who will have to give effect to this matter. Of course, we will consult on these matters and we have several months in which to do so. Given what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, his noble friends and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, indicated, I have no doubt that views will be expressed fairly freely by those who will have to implement the legislation. However, our task today is to produce a Bill that gives effect to the will of the House, as the House sees the issues of principle.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="090609119000007"></a>I venture to say that although issues relating to the mechanics of implementation are not unimportant&#151;I do not seek to dismiss them&#151;if I thought that the Bill would arbitrarily impose duties for the day after tomorrow which people could not possibly fulfil, of course I would change my perspective on it. But we have time to deal with these issues. I emphasise that we have support in both Houses. I emphasise again that the British Property Federation fully supports these amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has a very proud history of work in this area and recognises that the principle that we are putting forward is one to which he has long been concerned to give effect.</p>

<a name="90609-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="090609119000008"></a>I recognise that it is a function of diligent and effective opposition never to frustrate the will of a duly elected Government. However, sometimes it is proper for them to delay processes to enable further consideration to take place. We still have Third Reading

However, these amendments give effect to an important principle that represents a government concession to representations that have been made to us during the course of the Bill&#151;a principle which it seems to me is supported on all sides of the House. It is always tempting to make life a little easier by agreeing with the opposition Front Benches and with the forceful contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, to say nothing of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, who speaks with such knowledge on these issues. However, these amendments were tabled at an appropriate time&#151;Tuesday of last week&#151;and give effect to a principle which is widely supported. It is a beneficial and helpful development with regard to the Bill. Accordingly, I commend the amendment.</p>

There is no debate to agree a clause or a schedule at Third Reading. Given the procedural rules of the House, we can achieve this only by tabling amendments. There may be quite a number of amendments because we will want to look at the individual clauses in the light of the advice that we will get between now and then on the practicability of the scheme which the Government have embodied in this complex schedule.</p>

I have already declared my interest but I think that I should make it specifically clear here. I am a member of the executive&#151;known elsewhere as the cabinet&#151;in a London borough council which will be directly affected by these proposals.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="090609119000013"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to make it absolutely clear and beyond doubt in the Bill that the subsection in Clause 22 that refers to the costs of collection or recovery also includes the set-up costs&#151;the costs of implementing this procedure. As has already been said, London borough councils are the billing authorities and the GLA is the levying authority. We know that if and when the Bill is enacted, as I am sure it will be, London borough councils will be billing within a very short space of time. Indeed, the president of London Councils, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, has already made clear the considerable anxiety&#151;certainly not unwillingness; on the whole we welcome this&#151;in the organisation about the very short timescale for implementing all this and also about the additional costs of doing so. Most London borough councils are what are called &#147;floor authorities&#148;; in other words, although their grant entitlement may increase, the actual money that they receive will not. They will therefore be under particularly great financial pressure in the coming years, given the financial outlook, and that can only increase anxiety concerning the costs that will be incurred.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="090609119000014"></a>It is stated in the Bill, and reasonably so, that the costs of collection or recovery will be met from the levy raised, but it is not clear&#151;and we want it to be made clear now&#151;that the initial costs, which will probably be quite considerable, in setting up and initiating this proposal will also be met in that way. That can be made clear beyond doubt by including this amendment in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="090609119000015"></a>A further issue arises. There may well be, let us say, differences of opinion between the levying authority&#151;in this case, the GLA&#151;and London borough councils collectively or even individually as to what are reasonable costs either of recovery and collection or, perhaps even more likely, of setting up the process. How does the Minister foresee those differences ultimately being resolved? I am sure he will say that with good will they should be resolved between the levying authority and the billing authorities. Of course that is the case, but I think that those of us who are realistic know that that is not always achievable. Does he foresee any role for the Government in quickly resolving any outstanding disputes about those additional costs?</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="090609119000016"></a>I hope that the Minister can give us some comfort on this. There is considerable anxiety among London councils about the very short timescale for resolving all these issues, for carrying out the implementation and for recovering in full all the costs involved in so doing.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="090609120000001"></a>In moving this amendment, I have spoken specifically and exclusively about London because we know, without doubt, that London authorities will be the pathfinders for this. It will happen in London before it happens anywhere else. They are pathfinders, the only pathfinders. It will apply, in due course, to all other parts of the

I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept this amendment and, on that note of optimism, I beg to move.</p>

<a name="090609120000002"></a><b><a name="90609-0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090609120000080"></a>Lord Bates:</b> My Lords, I am not quite sure whether I should support this measure. The noble Lord managed to inspire me as part of his previous contribution. At this stage of the Bill, reaching Clause 22 on administrative expenses, he has probably done something towards the opposite in terms of talking through on this amendment on collection or recovery.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="090609120000003"></a>There is an entirely serious point wrapped up in the amendment. It gives us an opportunity to talk about what the administrative costs would be. Clause 22(3) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="090609120000025"></a>&#147;If the chargeable period of a BRS begins, or a variation of a BRS takes effect, later than the first day of a financial year, the levying authority may not, in respect of that financial year, act in reliance on provision made by virtue of subsection (1)&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609120000023"></a>That will therefore probably be coterminous with the collection period for the business rates in general. As boroughs are the collecting authority, one would hope that efficiencies would be introduced so that costs could be minimised. Therefore, the maximum amount is made available to go into the given project by combining business rates into one bill. I am happy to listen to what the noble Lord says in response to that point, and I will lend our support if needed.</p>

<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="090609120000004"></a><b><a name="90609-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="090609120000081"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tope, for moving the amendment. It enables me to clarify the issue that he raised, which the noble Lord, Lord Bates, also emphasised. It is an important issue and I recognise it to be so. It enables me to step a little way back from looking like I had no concern about billing authorities with regard to the previous amendment. I wanted to defend the positions set out in the government amendments. However, in representing that argument, I did not want in any way to present the problems facing the billing authorities as not being ones that the Government need to consider.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="090609120000005"></a>I want to reassure noble Lords that we recognise that certain costs could initially fall on building authorities. They do not want to be out of pocket for those costs. Clause 22 of the Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to authorise the billing authorities to use a prescribed proportion of BRS revenues to meet their collection and enforcement expenses where the levying authorities levy the BRS for the beginning of the financial year. That is what we expect to happen in most cases. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, said that he hoped that it would happen in all cases. That might be expecting a little too much. He is right, however, that we would want that to be the norm.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="090609120000006"></a>Where BRS is levied part of the way through a financial year, these costs cannot be recovered from BRS revenues. Instead they would have to be met by the levying authority. Clause 22 provides that the Secretary of State may make regulations prescribing the proportion of BRS revenues that may be retained by billing authorities when the supplement is collected as part of the normal billing round. Where costs have to be met by the levying authority, the Secretary of State may cap the amount that the levying authority is

Amendment 36 would enable billing authorities to recover the costs they incur in preparing for the collection and recovery of BRS.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="090609120000007"></a>We have issued a consultation paper with our proposals for secondary legislation, which will clearly be needed to enable BRS to be levied. The consultation paper covers the arrangements for the collection and enforcement of BRS, including the costs of collection, and envisages that those costs will cover set-up costs as well. The consultation paper floats different options for calculating the costs of collection. It invites views on whether those costs should be a fixed percentage of the annual total amount of BRS to be collected by the billing authority or whether they should be a fixed amount. A third option is for it to be agreed locally between the levying authority and the billing authority, subject to an upper limit to provide reassurance for business. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, suggested that there might be agreement between the authorities on that, although he may be sceptical of it being obtained in every case.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="090609120000008"></a>Our intention, subject to the outcome of that consultation, is that the billing authority should be able to recover its reasonable costs incurred in preparing, collecting and enforcing BRS. The three-month consultation period will give stakeholders the opportunity to express their views on those options or to come forward with alternative ways to address the issue&#151;or any of the proposed arrangements for administering BRS. That gives scope for the point emphasised in the previous amendment: we will not set out to implement the legislation until we have had that full consultation.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="090609120000009"></a>I should draw attention to another provision where costs may initially fall to the billing authority as part of the preparatory work involved in establishing a BRS. Clause 25 enables levying authorities to obtain certain information from billing authorities for the purposes of setting a BRS and drawing up a prospectus. Such information may include the addresses and rateable values of non-domestic properties in the area. The costs of providing that information may vary according to the type of information requested by the levying authority. We have therefore provided in Clause 25(3) for billing authorities to make a charge for providing that information, but it will be for the billing authority to decide whether it would be appropriate to make such a charge.</p>

<a name="90609-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="090609120000010"></a>I therefore hope that the noble Lord will accept that we have considered the issues. In discussing the previous group of amendments, I did not intend to be cavalier about implementation&#151;and I hope that I was not&#151;in seeking to defend the amendments. This amendment has given me the chance to show that the Government have thought about the issues. There will be full consultation. There will be options with regard to collection. I hope that the noble Lord feels that he can safely withdraw his amendment.</p>

In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, brought forward an amendment to exempt the Crossrail project from the requirement for a ballot. That amendment clearly had the support of the Committee and, in response, my noble friend Lady Andrews said, on behalf of the Government:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="090609120000078"></a>&#147;I have listened to the repeated calls in your Lordships&#146; House and during the passage of the Bill in another place for an exemption for Crossrail. I certainly agree with the argument that it brings major benefits across the capital, commands wide support, and is already underpinned by an Act of Parliament. Therefore, with the agreement of the Committee, I would like to accept the noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment 62&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/5/09; col. GC 532.]</p>

<p><a name="090609120000024"></a>This group of amendments makes only minor adjustments to the amendment proposed in Committee. My officials have worked with parliamentary counsel and I am advised that, to be absolutely confident that the amendment achieves the aim that the Committee clearly supported&#151;that is, to give the Crossrail project even greater certainty against challenge or arguments for a ballot, which would in turn import possible delay and risk to the project&#151;these adjustments are, indeed, necessary. With regard to the ballots, there has been no change between the outcome that the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, would have achieved and the new subsection that the Government have tabled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="090609120000017"></a>Finally, we have taken the opportunity of extending the exemption from the ballot requirement for Crossrail to cover the additionality requirement in Clause 3 of the Bill rather than leaving it to regulations. To ensure consistency with the position for ballots, we are making it clear in the Bill that the additionality requirement will not apply to Crossrail. That is to give certainty to the Crossrail BRS, a project which, I know, enjoys the support of the whole House.</p>

We were grateful for the concession given, which recognises the importance that we all attach to the Crossrail project. Indeed, our argument throughout the Bill, as a point of principle, is that the Bill should have been attached to the Crossrail Bill as it relates particularly

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="090609120000019"></a>In contrast to our previous debate on the government amendments, it is noticeable that whereas this amendment embraces a simple concept that results in a series of amendments running for six lines, a previous one embraced a simple concept and turned it into a schedule of six pages. That is a big difference. We do not want to sound ungrateful but that is a bit like somebody giving you &#163;20 and you feeling quite happy about getting a &#163;20 note when the other person is actually giving you &#163;20 in penny coins. You would just want to take the time to count that on the way out.</p>

However, the Minister did not grant that concession and we are therefore forced to take it on trust and count it before Third Reading. We certainly welcome these amendments and are grateful for the spirit in which they were offered. They are certainly the right thing to do and we are happy to be behind them.</p>

<a name="090609121000001"></a><b><a name="90609-0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="090609121000357"></a>Lord Bates:</b> My Lords, these two amendments, which have been tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Cathcart, are designed to provide an important guarantee to avoid retrospection in business rate supplements taxation and to highlight a staggering injustice that continues to be waged against portside industries in this country by virtue of the change in valuation procedures. The effect of these two amendments is simply to restrict the liability affecting business rate supplement if an alteration has been made due to an error that was not the fault of the business rate supplement payer. If it was not the fault of the BRS payer, there should be no retrospective collection of tax or levy under this Bill.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="090609121000002"></a>I hope that that statement seems obvious to all sides of the House. If there is no fault, how on earth can retrospection be imposed on businesses? These amendments point out an injustice that has resulted in just such a situation. There was a change in the way in which valuations were operated following a review carried out in 2006 by government tax inspectors at the Valuation Office Agency. Each port used to pay a single levy for all the businesses operating within the port area. Following the 2006 review, the Valuation Office Agency decided that each firm in a port area was in separate occupation. Therefore, from 55 ports in England and Wales, the levy would now be made on 1,600 portside operators. Rather than giving advance warning to those businesses of the change, the Valuation Office Agency retrospectively backdated the next tax bills not to 2006 but to 2005. As a result, portside operators, which are already on the brink and in many cases clinging on for dear life as viable businesses, were landed with an additional tax of &#163;124 million.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="090609121000003"></a>In introducing this retrospective tax, the Government disregarded their own rules. The rules that they contravened were that there should be an impact assessment, but none was made; that there should be a consultation exercise with those affected, but no such exercise was carried out; and that there should be an assessment of the impact on the wider economy, but no such assessment was undertaken. The policy also contravenes the Treasury&#146;s own guidance on retrospective taxation.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="090609121000004"></a>The Government have admitted that this was a mistake. In fact, John Healey acknowledged that during a debate in another place, when he said that it was a regrettable mistake. As evidence of regret over the nature of the mistake, the Government introduced a small concession, whereby payment of the backdated bill could be spread over eight years. They felt that that would be sufficient to deal with the problem.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="090609121000005"></a>However, that is certainly not the case. Many businesses face huge increases in their bills. I wish to mention a couple of the businesses that have come to my attention  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_551"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 551</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and made representations to me. Andrew Dixon of Freshney Cargo in Grimsby talked about his additional rates bill taking his annual business rates bill from &#163;48,000 to nearly &#163;900,000, which is an additional &#163;850,000. Even spread over eight years, that is still an additional &#163;100,000 per year, which needs to be found at a time when all other sorts of business rates have been increased and when trade is sinking dramatically.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="090609121000006"></a>The impact of this has led to many people losing their jobs. Victoria Ayling has done an outstanding job in drawing attention to this injustice, highlighting a number of cases in the Grimsby area. She recalled an instance where a father had just been made redundant as a result of this tax and his son had to take a forced reduction in his number of hours. She pointed to the impact on companies such as Conoco and DFDS. It has a huge impact on the car industry. I know from my own experience of visiting the CAT depot at Teesport that it has a huge impact, as CAT occupies a large space of land for allowing landing vehicles into this country.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="090609121000007"></a>This was debated in this House when my noble friend Lord Attlee ably proposed a Motion on it. In that debate we heard from a number of highly experienced and knowledgeable people about the impact on businesses. I will give some of the examples that were mentioned. In the port of Hull, the effect of this backdating amounts to &#163;25 million. In Liverpool, it amounts to &#163;22 million. In Immingham it is &#163;19 million; in Goole it is &#163;6.5 million; and in Grimsby it is &#163;4.8 million. The Minister lamented yesterday as to why his party was failing so poorly compared to the Conservative Party in Wales. Here might be one of the answers. In Cardiff, the bill for this additional tax has increased by &#163;1.6 million.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="090609121000008"></a>This is a spectacular own goal when the Government are trying to introduce measures to save jobs. Here is a very simple measure. It does not cost the &#163;50 billion to bail out the banks; it only costs &#163;124 million to correct something that had nothing to do with the businesses themselves. It was not their fault; it was the fault of the Valuation Office Agency, which has contravened at least five of the commitments that the Government gave about retrospection. This amendment, by guaranteeing that such a series of events could not recur in the context of the Business Rate Supplements Bill, further raises the pressure on the Government to step forward and address this serious injustice. I beg to move.</p>

It comprises a single sentence in plain English, which is quite a change from some of the discussion on the Bill. It is quite evident that it is desirable to put it into the Bill because of the history referred to by the noble Lords, Lord Bates and Lord Tope. I was present in the discussion when the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, raised this point before and I was extremely unhappy about the way in which the businesses in the ports were treated; I thought that it was quite wrong, but that our ability to correct it was also very limited. A minor correction was made by deferment of some of the charge, that is true, but, in my view, that was not good enough. The advantage of the amendment is that it makes quite explicit in the Bill that we are not going to have retrospective liability imposed on a ratepayer when there is no error or default on his part. That seems to me self-evident. You might think that it is so self-evident that it should not be put in the Bill, but I would like to see it in the Bill. I will certainly vote for the amendment if we are invited to do so.</p>

It ensures that the costs of errors in the collection of business rates are borne by those responsible for the errors and not by the innocent parties. It promotes the efficient and timely collection of business rates, which is critical to the maintenance of public finances both now and in the future. I urge the Minister to agree to my noble friend&#146;s amendment and, if necessary, to support it in the Division Lobby.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="090609121000039"></a>&#147;The scale of the drop is manifest in two separate statistics. The Baltic Dry Index, the index of shipping costs for dry bulk commodities (iron ore, coal, graphite and grains), fell to a 22-year low of 663 on 22 December, a 95% drop from its all-time high of 11,793 in May. The cost of chartering a Cape-size ship fell from $235,000 a day at the peak of the market to just $2,300 a day in early December ... Since December, there has been a bounce, as China has re-entered the market in a limited way. By early February, the Baltic Dry Index had doubled from its December low, to 1498, and the cost of hiring a Cape-size ship had multiplied  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_553"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 553</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>10 times to $26,500 a day, compared with its low of $2,300. Needless to say, in spite of this impressive recovery, it only represents one-ninth of the peak reached in the early part of 2008. Notwithstanding this bounce from extreme lows, continued recovery is not expected by industry insiders&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609121000032"></a>Those two paragraphs are an index of the scale of the problem that is facing ports at the present time.</p>

I shall not delay your Lordships&#146; House with the details at such a time, after my noble friend&#146;s eloquence, but for the businesses that have written to think that it is worth while raising these issues with me, who has no background in this matter, is an index of their seriousness. If, despite all this, the Government regard this matter as a storm in a teacup, as was implied by the Minister in Committee, we are, of course, all aware that Lord Sugar, as he not yet is, is riding to the aid of SMEs and I hope that we can be confident, on issues like this, that, if the sugar gets into the teacup, it will be&#151;to coin the phrase&#151;shaken and not simply stirred.

He mentioned that the Government think that they have solved the problem by deferring the rates and allowing them to be paid over an eight-year period. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Tope, suggested, while that might help cash flow in the short term, it does not solve the problem, which is that the total of this huge tax liability must, by law, be booked immediately in the accounts of the businesses as a deferred liability and their auditors will need to be satisfied that this deferred liability is matched by sufficient assets, otherwise they must declare the business technically insolvent. What bank in their right minds will lend money to a company that is technically insolvent? This just compounds the problems for these wretched businesses round the ports. Even the Government&#146;s own Insolvency Service is warning Ministers that this could push many firms into insolvency.</p>

I shall come on to the question of the ports in a moment, but let us consider first the issue of principle. The amendments would prevent BRS from being levied retrospectively as a result of a change in the rating list. I am all too conscious that, if there is one word that threatens to dog Ministers in this noble House, it is &#147;retrospection&#148;. I had the blissful experience of defending the concept during the banking legislation and the scars will stay with me for a considerable time, although the House was persuaded of the justifiable nature of retrospection in that legislation.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="090609121000018"></a>However, I do not have the same inhibition with this Bill&#151;very far from it. I understand why the amendments have been prompted by the difficulties in the ports, which I shall come on to. However, BRS builds on the non-domestic rating system. In particular, liability to BRS and the level of liability in respect of any given property will be based on the rating list entry for that property. Rating lists, as the whole House will be aware, can be changed by valuation  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_554"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 554</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>officers to ensure accuracy and, with that, the accuracy of rates liability. Sometimes this can lead to backdated increases in rates liability. That is a fact of our rating system, so I am not prepared to have the amendment moved as if the Government were, at this stage, introducing an element of retrospection that no one had been aware of. After all, it is also the case that the other aspect is true&#151;&#147;retrospective&#148; might mean that there is a reduced liability for rates, and refunds would be paid out in such a case.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="090609121000019"></a>There is the possibility of backdated increases in rateable value causing higher BRS bills than businesses were anticipating, but we are faced with the practicalities involved in ascertaining the need for changes to a rating list and then establishing what change is required. Backdating is an essential part of the normal functioning of the system. Let us disabuse ourselves of the idea that there is anything exceptional about what the Bill proposes with regard to BRS.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="090609121000020"></a>In introducing his amendments, the noble Lord, Lord Bates, has given an instance. It does not clarify the issue, though; rather, it clouds it. Not that I am saying that he does not have the right to introduce the concerns of the ports, nor am I going to resile from the fact that my noble friend confessed to an element of fault that had occurred with regard to that position.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="090609121000021"></a>The port issue does not, however, affect the principle. It is only right that businesses will be asked to pay the BRS that is due on their property and to pay at the correct level, otherwise we are going to have businesses occupying properties of the same rateable value being liable for different bills. It would be unfair to those businesses that have been paying the correct supplement if others were paying a smaller bill due simply to an inaccuracy on the rating list and because they were not asked to pay the correct supplement. It is also worth reiterating that BRS bills, like rates bills, will go down as a result of a change to the rating list in certain circumstances. This is a normal function of the system.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="090609121000022"></a>With regard to the ports, the Chancellor announced in the Pre-Budget Report that the Government will legislate to give businesses more time to pay in certain circumstances because we recognise the problems that port businesses face. Legislation has been passed so that businesses facing such bills in those circumstances will not be required to pay their backdated liability within the financial year at present but will be able to do so in equal interest-free instalments over eight years.</p>

<a name="90609-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="090609121000023"></a>I heard what the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, said about the problems for businesses faced by this bill. However, if a business that had arrived at this position because of backdating had ensured, operating under legislation constructed to make this possible, that the liability should obtain over eight years, it would be a very odd judgment by a bank or by anyone else doing business with it that it was not a viable business because of this particular feature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="090609121000024"></a>Although the review of ports, and the subsequent separate assessment of a number of new properties within ports, highlighted the issue of the impact of backdated liability, the legislative changes implemented will apply to all ratepayers occupying properties that meet the criteria, including those in ports that meet

The legislation is working. As at 8 May this year, local authorities have reported that 185 properties within the ports review had paid &#163;30 million of backdated liabilities in full and that a further 88 business properties within ports had been granted a schedule of payments under the legislation to which I have referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="090609121000025"></a>To conclude, the provisions in the Bill are entirely consistent with the national business rate system. They ensure that the liability to business rate supplements is fair to all. We had a particular problem with the ports, which the Government have addressed. That issue is not relevant to the principle obtaining on our business rating system in this country. This Bill is fully consistent with the ratings system that we operate. Accordingly, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Before doing so, I will respond to some of the points made by the Minister.</p>

<a name="90609-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="090609121000027"></a>First, the Minister says that this is entirely consistent with other business taxation. It is not. The businesses being impacted and blighted by the levying of this backdated tax were not liable. It was not the case that they had the incorrect rating or had somehow made the wrong declaration themselves. They were not liable at all for this taxation. It has been introduced this year and backdated to 2005. That is an entirely different thing. Of course there needs to be the backdating element, but it needs to be kept where the fault is with the business itself.</p>

<a name="90609-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="090609121000028"></a>Consider for a moment the implication of what the Minister is saying. It removes all pressure from the Valuation Office Agency to take responsibility for its actions. It can go on in the clear knowledge that it does not have to keep an up-to-date list or advise people in a timely way. It can go on ad infinitum and backdate measures at any level that it requires.</p>

<a name="90609-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="090609121000029"></a>Secondly, on the impact on real businesses and real jobs, trading conditions will come and go. They have been referred to in this debate. This is not something that is the result of trading conditions; it is the result of an acknowledged mistake, an error by the Valuation Office Agency and the Government, which is costing people in this country their jobs and causing businesses to close at a time of recession. It is a spectacular own goal on the part of the Government. One would have hoped that they would respond more favourably to it.</p>

My noble friend apologised in Committee for the mistake that gave rise to this situation. The Government are making reparation. Yet we are discussing a Bill about the business rate supplement; this is an amendment to that Bill. I maintain that the Bill follows the normal pattern of business rate levies in this country and I fail to understand why one instance&#151;a mistake that produced detrimental consequences to which the Government have responded&#151;should jeopardise the arrangements in this Bill when the Bill follows the pattern of business rates across the country.</p>

This matter was debated and referred to in this House. The result was that the Motion put forward by my noble friend Lord Attlee was supported by 77 votes to 69. Despite all the evidence, the Government continued to make no response. Despite all the apologies, to which the Minister has added liberally today, there has been no acknowledgement that there need to be reparations that say to valuation officers that they cannot backdate in this instance, that they made a mistake, that they must put it right and that they must not take it out on hard-pressed businesses and hard-working families around this country. The Minister has not convinced me at all. In fact, he has reinforced my view on this matter. I want to press the amendment and test the view of this House.</p>

If a body comes to rest in a particular coronial jurisdiction, no matter where the death occurs, that coroner is seized of his responsibilities. I believe I need say no more than that.

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="090609133000003"></a>At the beginning of 2008, following the delays in implementing many of the recommendations that arose from the murder of patients by Dr Harold Shipman and the subsequent murder in 2002 of patients at Leeds General Infirmary by the nurse Colin Norris, I tabled a series of Questions to the Government. The Shipman murders had led to an inquiry, which published six reports and 228 recommendations at a cost to the public purse of some &#163;21 million. Weaknesses were discovered in the death certification process; the requirement for one doctor alone to certify a death and decide on referral to a coroner; and the failure to cross-reference notified deaths and look for trends and patterns. Among the 228 recommendations were many other proposals to strengthen the system of public protection.</p>

<a name="90609-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="090609133000004"></a>After Shipman&#146;s trial, the inquiry, chaired by Dame Janet Smith, decided that there was enough evidence to suggest that Shipman had probably killed around 250 people, of whom 218 could be identified. About 80 per cent of his victims were women. In the case of Nurse Colin Norris, on 8 March 2008, he was convicted of murdering four elderly patients and attempting to murder another. Mr Justice Griffith told Norris, in sentencing:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="090609133000023"></a>&#147;You are, I have absolutely no doubt, a thoroughly evil and dangerous man. You are an arrogant and manipulative man with a real dislike of elderly patients. The most telling evidence was that observation of one of your female patients, Bridget Tarpey, who said, &#145;He didn&#146;t like us old women&#146;&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609133000005"></a>On 25 March 2008, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, in responding to my Written Questions about these events, stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="090609133000024"></a>&#147;I understand that the Yorkshire and Humberside Strategic Health Authority is arranging for an independent investigation of the events at Leeds General Infirmary and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further at this stage&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/3/08; col. <I>WA81</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="090609133000006"></a>Later, on 21 May 2008, the noble Lord replied to my Written Questions about the Shipman recommendations, stating:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="090609133000025"></a>&#147;Clauses implementing these important reforms will be included in the coroners and death certification Bill announced as part of the Government&#146;s draft legislative programmes for 2008-09&#148;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="090609133000026"></a>&#147;The Government believe that these proposals represent a transparent, proportionate, consistent and affordable response to the weaknesses identified by the Shipman inquiry that will provide greater protection for the public and improve the quality and accuracy of death certification&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/5/08; col. <I>WA196</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="090609133000008"></a>I recognise, as I told the noble Lord, Lord Bach, at Second Reading, that this Bill goes a long way in trying to prevent a repetition of these appalling crimes that took place in the north of England. However, there are still anomalies in the law that could allow cases such as those that I have described to slip through. At Second Reading, I asked the Minister how many of the 228 recommendations of the Shipman inquiry had been incorporated into this legislation, and what further measures would be needed to deal with the failings identified by the Norris inquiry. Last week I called the Minister&#146;s office to indicate that I would pursue the question today. I hope that it will now be possible to answer that inquiry. For the sake of clarity, I inform the Committee that I met Dame Janet Smith with my noble friend Lady Finlay of Llandaff. We discussed the amendments that I have tabled to the first part of the Bill. They have been tabled in consultation with Dame Janet Smith and try to close the gap that still exists in the legislation. Out of courtesy, I copied details of the amendments in advance to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and the noble Lords who represent the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. I believe that the incorporation of the amendments standing in my name would improve this legislation and go a long way to answering Dame Janet&#146;s concerns.</p>

<a name="90609-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="090609133000009"></a>In particular, I take the Committee to page 54 of the Ministry of Justice document published on 21 May 2008 entitled, <I>Statutory Duty for Doctors and Other Public Service Personnel to Report Deaths to the Coroner</I>, (CP(R) 12/07). Paragraph 6 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="090609133000027"></a>&#147;Coroners have a broad duty to investigate unnatural deaths, as well as all deaths which occur in custody or other state detention or during the course of police operations. There was a general consensus that the right categories of deaths were included in the consultation paper flowing from this general definition. Many helpful suggestions were put forward to help clarify the detail. Following the consultation process, we believe that the following categories of cases that should be referred to the coroner will provide the basis for further work and consultation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609133000016"></a>I shall give the Committee details of what appears in that list. I know that the Government have an inbred dislike of including lists in legislation so I am not inviting them to include the entire list but these were the conclusions that were registered by the Government themselves in answer to the consultation paper. My amendment seeks to take the list and in a generic way provide a trigger mechanism for investigating any deaths that might fall into these categories.</p>

<a name="90609-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="090609133000010"></a>The list in the document refers to:</p>
<ul><a name="090609133000029"></a>&#147;death resulting from self harm and neglect (excluding deaths from alcohol or nicotine abuse where the death would not be investigated but for those reasons); death resulting from neglect or abuse where there is an established duty of care by a public authority, other organisations and individuals; death occurring during or shortly after a period of detention; death caused or contributed to by the conduct of the police or any other state authority or public organisation; death relating to past or present employment; death resulting from lack of care or appropriate treatment, defective treatment and adverse reaction to prescribed medicine; death of a child where it is unexpected; death where a violent crime is suspected; sudden and accidental death, and deaths resulting from traffic incidents; where a death has not been certified as the doctor is unable to identify with any confidence the cause of death; death where there is reason to believe it may have been caused or contributed by a disease or condition that has been specified as being reportable to the coroner because of

<a name="90609-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="090609133000011"></a>Let us take that last category alone,</p>
<ul><a name="090609133000030"></a>&#147;death associated with pregnancy and childbirth&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="090609133000017"></a>or deaths in hospitals through, say, the outbreak of MRSA, or a disease such as sepsis where bereaved families might well believe that a loved one has died through negligence and yet the cause of death might not appear to be unnatural. I refer the Minister to page 18 of the response to the consultation document and the specific request of Dame Janet Smith and Her Honour Mrs Justice Swift, who specifically asked that some of the categories to which I have just referred should be incorporated in the legislation as a way for people who feel that the system has not responded to their concerns to be assured that the matter will be addressed.</p>

<a name="90609-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="090609133000012"></a>This amendment is designed to provide a catch-all for all those categories in the list I mentioned which are not spelt out in the Bill. It would remedy the disconnect between what the doctor has to report and what may warrant an investigation in the public interest. I have with me a copy of the final death certificate issued by Harold Shipman. It was given to me by Dame Janet and details the death of Mrs Kathleen Grundy. She died at the age of 81 on 25 June 1998. The day before her death this elderly but sprightly and healthy lady had provided hospitality for her elderly friends at a club she attended. Her death certificate simply records that &#147;old age&#148; was the,</p>
<ul><a name="090609133000031"></a>&#147;disease or condition directly leading to her death&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609133000018"></a>We owe it to the memory of victims of Shipman such as Mrs Grundy to get this right. We also owe it to Dame Janet and her outstanding colleagues who have provided such a remarkable public service in their meticulous and comprehensive inquiry. I hope that the Minister will feel able to respond positively to the amendment that I have laid before your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

This stems from the work of the Joint Committee on Human Rights of which I am a member. Before I get to the heart of the amendment, I congratulate the Government on requiring coroners to investigate deaths that have occurred in state detention. This is a positive human-rights move. The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear what state detention is. All we have is the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="090609133000032"></a>&#147;in custody or otherwise in state detention&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609133000019"></a>That is a good move but it would be better if we could have clarity in the Bill about what state detention means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="090609133000014"></a>We have the Explanatory Notes to the Bill, which are very useful and come in a thick tome. They explain the Government&#146;s view that the extension enhances the state&#146;s ability to meet its obligations under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to a number of cases where the liberty of the subject may have been constrained&#151;for example, where people have died while being detained in a variety of contexts, such as in prisons, by the police, in court cells, in young offender institutions, in secure training centres, in secure accommodation and under mental health or immigration and asylum legislation. Of course,

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="090609133000015"></a>I am not saying that the amendment includes all the possible instances of where a coroner&#146;s investigation might be necessary. Indeed, the amendment says that the list would &#147;include&#148; the following. Therefore, the list is not comprehensive but it would certainly add clarity to the Bill and I hope that the Government will agree that, rather than hiding this in the Explanatory Notes, it is better to have it in the Bill so that everyone knows exactly what we mean. Having said that, I repeat my welcome for the inclusion of the provision by the Government but I just think that they should go one step further in making it clearer.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90609-0007.htm"/>


<a name="90609-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="090609135000002"></a>We have been told that the role of the medical examiners will be to feed into the governance processes and to detect failings in care and drive up standards of care within the jurisdiction of a PCT area. However, one problem is how to define a natural death and how to decide whether the death is natural but has been brought forward in time or whether it has occurred because of clinical non-responsiveness&#151;I shall not say &#147;negligence&#148;, as that is too strong a word, but I am referring to whether something could have been done to avoid the death. A classic example is death in childbirth. Medical science now means that very few women, but still too many, die in childbirth in this country, but of course in many other parts of the world a catastrophically large number of women still die in that way. When these deaths are investigated, some of them are, sadly, found to be due to medical negligence. Examples are where, for whatever reason, a woman has not been oxygenated during a caesarean section under anaesthesia, where the response to something such as a catastrophic haemorrhage has been too slow or where the management of labour has led to some complication which, although rare, does occur, such as a ruptured uterus and the catastrophic events that follow that. These are so-called natural deaths but certainly they are totally unexpected and potentially avoidable. I can of course understand why you cannot define &#147;natural&#148; or &#147;unnatural&#148; clearly in the Bill; it is understood in the way that you speak about things.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="090609135000003"></a>The other reason for having a public interest test is that deaths which are due to, for example, infection or environmental issues gradually come to light as a clustering of deaths occurs. As these deaths unroll, the investigation focuses not so much on one individual but on a group of individuals. We have recently heard about swine flu in Mexico, where the mortality rate has been particularly high. It seems that that may be due to the high arsenic levels in the groundwater. That has meant that there is a degree of subliminal arsenic poisoning in the population which inhibits people&#146;s immune system and makes them more vulnerable to the severe effects of swine flu. Therefore, they have  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_563"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 563</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>died whereas others who have not been so exposed have come through the infection fine, with no adverse sequelae.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="090609135000004"></a>Where there is a clustering of deaths, the coroner has to be able to investigate them, not so much for the individual but because of the public interest. With time, we may well find that something such as environmental toxins causes a clustering of deaths, because we do not know what lies ahead.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="090609135000005"></a>I am sure the Minister will say that there is great sense in not putting lists in legislation. If you make a list, there is always the problem of what is to be left out. I would simply commend to him the concept of public interest. It would underline the governance role that has been emphasised in some of the reforms of the coronial system.</p>

<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="090609135000006"></a><b><a name="90609-0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090609135000021"></a>Lord Alderdice:</b> I shall speak to Amendments 2 and 3. In beginning his speech, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred us back to the Shipman inquiry and the dreadful events leading up to it. As I pointed out on Second Reading, the Government rightly moved very quickly to deal with some of the medical aspects, but it has taken more time to deal with the coroners aspects. It seems to me that the important point in the comments just made by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, is that sufficient attention had not been paid to the clustering of deaths. If proper attention had been paid, it would have been clear that there was an emerging problem. Indeed, as I understand it, the first observation of the problem ultimately came not from the coroners but from others. As we go through the Bill we will find a number of circumstances that bring us back to that dreadful experience, because part of the business of the Bill is to address and redress that experience. One of the ways of doing that is to give the coroners the responsibility to look a little more widely than they have traditionally done. That is very important.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="090609135000007"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said when speaking to his amendment, which we support, we all welcome the new extended duty to investigate deaths in state detention; we very much welcome the human rights-enhancing components of this measure. As he said, however, it is a little disappointing that we find this only in the Explanatory Notes. There does not seem to be any reason why it should not be spelt out and explained in the Bill. &#147;State detention&#148; has different meanings to different people. It is important to spell it out and to make it clear, as he has done in his amendment. If another, more precise amendment is proposed, so be it, but we think that it is important to spell it out. That is not to say that we take the view that coroners should restrict themselves to investigating whether we are all compliant with the human rights convention. We will come to that a little later.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="090609135000008"></a>Perhaps I may point out one specific way in which even the excellent amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, seems not to go quite far enough. He refers in paragraph (b) to those detained under mental health legislation. What we usually think about is how important it is to ensure that people are not inappropriately detained under any legislation, including mental health legislation. However, one way  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_564"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 564</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in which a death can not infrequently occur is not in relation to the implementation of the mental health legislation but precisely at the point where the person is no longer detained. They are detained because it is felt that they are suicidal and a danger to themselves. So they are detained in an appropriate place and given an assessment and treatment. At that point they will probably, we hope, be in somewhat less danger. They then present themselves in a reasonable fashion for a time&#151;I have seen this happen myself. So the detention is stopped and they are no longer detained by the state. Often that is precisely the point at which they are at much greater danger of doing harm to themselves and coming into the purview of the coroner.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="090609135000009"></a>So even if we were to adopt the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs&#151;as I say, we very much support adopting it&#151;one incredibly important group of people would not be addressed, precisely because they had moved out of state detention at the very point when they came to harm. That is why not only the noble Lord&#146;s amendment but the prior amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, are very important. I think that we will also come to other amendments that will help expand this a little further. At this point, however, we find these amendments extremely helpful. We look forward to the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="090609135000010"></a><b><a name="90609-0007.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="090609135000022"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> I thank all noble Lords who have spoken on this group of amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked for clarification on Amendment 1. We argue that Clause 1 makes it clear that the coroner&#146;s duty to investigate a death is triggered by virtue of being made aware of the body of the deceased person being located within his or her area. Where the death actually occurred is largely irrelevant to the triggering of that duty, although if the body were moved after death from one area to another, the duty would apply only to the first coroner to whom the report was made. That also applies to deaths that occur overseas&#151;a matter that I know is of concern to many noble Lords&#151;but where the body is repatriated to England and Wales. In such cases, the duty to investigate the death lies with the coroner within whose jurisdiction the body is returned. I hope that in those few words I have satisfactorily clarified the Government&#146;s position on Clause 1.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="090609135000011"></a>Turning to Amendment 2, I refer noble Lords to regulations under Clause 18, which will prescribe cases and circumstances in which a death should be reported to a coroner, which will provide more detail as to the types of case which will trigger a coroner's duty to investigate. We shall be consulting further on the content of those regulations as part of the secondary legislation process. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, and other noble Lords mentioned the tragic, awful case of those who were murdered by Dr Shipman. I thank the noble Lord for saying that we have gone a long way in attempting to deal with the issues that that ghastly case threw up. His point is that the deaths that occurred at the hands of Dr Shipman appeared at first glance to be wholly natural and non-suspicious but, with the benefit of hindsight, it would have been in the public interest to investigate them.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_565"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 565</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90609-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="090609135000012"></a>We believe that the new death certification procedures contained later in the Bill will succeed much more readily in detecting such deaths and bringing them to the attention of the coroner, so that the duty to investigate will be triggered where necessary. I stress that the coroner's duty to investigate is a continuing duty. If fresh evidence regarding a death comes to light later&#151;evidence that quite clearly brings the death in question within the scope of Clause 1(2)&#151;an investigation must be held even if a period of some months or even years has passed since the death in question.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="090609135000013"></a>The noble Lord wrote to me, and just this morning I signed off the letter back to him, which will be copied to all those who spoke on Second Reading. In advance of his receiving my letter, perhaps I may tell him what I had to say about his request for figures regarding the exact number of recommendations. On the Shipman inquiry, it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="090609135000017"></a>&#147;The ... Bill incorporates legislation responding to the Shipman Inquiry&#146;s <I>T</I><I>hird </I><I>R</I><I>eport</I><I> ...</I>. As you know, whilst accepting the findings of the inquiry, the Government has decided to adopt a different approach to reforming the coroner service than that recommended by Dame Janet Smith. For this reason, [it] is not possible to provide a figure regarding the exact number of recommendations responded to by legislation incorporated in the Bill. More generally, you will wish to be aware that the Coroners and Justice Bill is the last piece of primary legislation required to implement the Government&#146;s wide ranging programme of action in response to the recommendations of the Shipman Inquiry&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609135000016"></a>I also wrote to the noble Lord about the case of Colin Norris, which he referred to today.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="090609135000014"></a>So we are not convinced of the necessity for Amendment 2. On Amendment 3, the last in this group, we have no difficulty with my noble friend&#146;s comments about accepting the accuracy of the list of circumstances that the amendment contains and which are to be regarded as constituting either custody or state detention for the purposes of triggering an automatic coroner&#146;s investigation under Clause 1. They effectively replicate, as he said, the list contained in the Explanatory Notes. However, we do not think that it is necessary to include such a list in the Bill. I refer my noble friend and the Committee to Clause 39(2), which we think has an adequate definition of what constitutes state detention. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a><a name="090609135000018"></a>&#147;A person is in state detention if he or she is compulsorily detained by a public authority within the meaning of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998&#148;.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="090609135000015"></a>In addition, the Explanatory Notes that will accompany this Act, if and when it becomes such, will contain a list similar to that which appears in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill. I would anticipate with some confidence that the Chief Coroner will also include a similar list in any guidance that he or she may publish. I hope that that reassures my noble friend about our intentions, and I thank him for the compliments that he paid to the Government on introducing the concept of state detention within the categories mentioned. I also hope that he agrees that it is not necessary to have such a list in primary legislation and that, in the light of my attempted explanation, noble Lords will agree not to press their amendments.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="090609138000002"></a>In fact, when listening to the Minister&#146;s response to Amendment 2, I was struck by the recollection that on many occasions in legislation Secretaries of State are given specific powers, rounded off by a more general one to act in the public interest. I wondered whether one reason why the Minister was hesitant to grant this more general power to the coroner was because it might be felt that the coroner was less attuned to assessing the public interest. Was that why the Minister said what he said? On my amendment, however, I am content with the noble Lord&#146;s clarification, which I found extremely helpful.</p>

I thank the Minister for his response although, like the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I have some anxiety about merely recording these concerns in regulation. Between now and Report stage, we shall of course look carefully at the Minister&#146;s suggestions.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="090609138000004"></a>I come back to the recommendations made by the Shipman inquiry itself, of which there were 228. Without asking him to go through them in detail today, or even in response to my letter, it is reasonable to inquire now which of those have not been included in the recommendations contained in the Bill. Although the Government have decided not to pursue the route recommended to them by Dame Janet Smith, it would nevertheless be helpful to the Committee to know that. As the noble Lord said, so much of this legislation is based on that experience of the Shipman inquiry and the recommendations that were made.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="090609138000005"></a>My noble friend Lady Finlay of Llandaff made a very good point about the issue of childbirth and when babies die in natural or unnatural circumstances, how those are recorded and whether there would be a public interest requirement in triggering an inquiry. That specific point was made by Lady Justice Smith and Mrs Justice Swift when they responded to the Government&#146;s original consultation; that is recorded on page 18 of the consultation document. As we consider this matter further between now and Report, I hope that the Minister will accept that there may be a need to persist with the amendment. However, it would be better if we could reach consensus.</p>

I take the latter&#146;s point about people leaving mental health detention when they can be particularly vulnerable. I understand that; it was not something that the Joint Committee on Human Rights looked into, but I am sympathetic to the noble Lord&#146;s point. My noble friend explained why the Explanatory Notes and the advice to coroners would be sufficient. I would have preferred it in the Bill, but he explained the Government&#146;s position and I do not want to move my amendment.</p>

At the moment, an inquest can be opened but because there is no requirement to keep the family informed and no time limit is set, some families have had an inquest opened but proceedings have not occurred, sometimes for years. The problem for a bereaved family is that they often look to the inquest for closure and for some unanswered questions to be answered. Sometimes they have unrealistic expectations of what an inquest will provide for them.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="090609138000009"></a>At the time, however, an inquest is also traumatic for a bereaved family because it reactivates their grief. They relive the events, and with doing that they relive the emotions, raising a whole lot of &#147;if only&#148; questions. Sometimes those had been dormant; sometimes new questions emerge. No one, then, should underestimate the role which an inquest can have in people&#146;s bereavement: to take them back in time and almost to relive the shock of the original event, of hearing the news and all that went with it. The problem is that it can increase distress if new light is shone on what happened or a new slant emerges from something with which they had begun to come to terms.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="090609138000010"></a>I have tabled Amendment 6 because if an inquest case is referred to another coroner, it is important that both the first and second coroners are subject to the same requirement. The amendment does not set targets but requires some sort of monitoring process for delays. It is particularly important not to set targets, as it may be that a slow and thoughtful inquest is exactly what is needed thoroughly to investigate a death. The problem is much greater where a coroner has a high workload and one case falls to the bottom of the pile or the back of the queue, lingering on either because it is not a major case or something else very major comes along and bounces it down that queue of cases to be heard.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="090609138000011"></a>My view is that the Chief Coroner needs to know if one coroner has an undue workload or is failing to keep up with the workload for whatever reason. It is human nature for people, when they are somewhat snowed under, to take some time to call for help.  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_568"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 568</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Monitoring delays could give a good early warning sign that problems may be emerging in one jurisdiction. It may be that a coroner is severely under-resourced, and that would emerge as well. This might be a way to audit the processes.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="090609139000001"></a>The other area in which timeliness becomes particularly important is where deaths occur abroad. It is difficult for coroners to get information from other countries about a death. Despite repeated inquiries, sometimes they simply receive a note saying &#147;heart stopped&#148; or words to that effect, which sheds no light on what happened when in this country such a death would be extensively investigated. In the case of an accident or where the remains are dispersed or difficult to find, or they are returned to this country very late, it is extremely difficult to ascertain what really happened. The inquest can be unsatisfactory because currently coroners have no power in this area, and I do not see anything in the Bill that would give them a power to request information. I want to ask the Minister whether there have been moves in the European Union to empower coroners to request information from other countries within the EU and whether there are routes for coroners to get information from countries outside the EU. After talking to coroners, it is the case that information is more readily available from countries outside the EU, so it is not that the EU standard is higher than that of the rest of the world. In fact, sometimes it is quite the reverse.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="090609139000002"></a>An inquest can be opened and proceedings delayed because a prosecution is pending, and if the prosecution does not then proceed, so be it. Everyone understands that, and again that is why I would not want to see a 12-month time limit to be viewed in any way as a judgment on an individual coroner.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="090609139000003"></a>Quite apart from the difficulties for the bereaved, there may be delays in remedial action being taken if it is evident that it is needed following a death. It may be that another death occurs during the delay, which is a tragedy if it happens because somewhere there was a degree of negligence.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="090609139000004"></a>I think that everyone in this House welcomes the provision for one coroner to be able to transfer their workload to another coroner for a multitude of reasons. I hope that it will be possible within that framework to ensure that as a coroner develops expertise in a certain area or in a type of death, the Chief Coroner would be able to steer that coroner towards investigating deaths in their area of expertise. As we know, there are groups of deaths. At Second Reading I talked about the deaths in Bridgend. The coroners in South Wales are aware of the problem of suicide in young people, particularly those related to use of the internet. A pool of expertise has been built up which makes those coroners appropriate to conduct inquests into such tragic deaths.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="090609139000005"></a>The background to the amendments is to set a standard of timeliness and I hope that the Government will see the sense in trying to do that. I beg to move.</p>

She also mentioned the issue of lessons learnt, which is extremely important in terms of remedial action. The third reason to avoid delay is that it is also difficult for witnesses at an inquest to remember accurately. Memories can fade even after a few months, while after four or five years it is hard for anyone to remember events accurately.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="090609139000007"></a>I have tabled an amendment that would simply insert the word &#147;timely&#148;. The noble Baroness is right to say that we should not try to define what &#147;timely&#148; is, but when delay results because authorities have not got their act together, being inefficient and not prioritising the work that needs to be done&#151;I refer to the police, local authorities, the Crown Prosecution Service and so on&#151;it is clear that it is not the coroner who is delaying the proceedings. However, I would accept that a lack of resources may be a problem for coroners, and I recognise that the Government are trying to solve it in this Bill by enabling certain geographical changes.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="090609139000008"></a>Inquests are delayed for many reasons. An organisation known as INQUEST has furnished me and, I am sure, many other noble Lords with a lot of examples of young people who have died in custody and the inquest has been delayed for four or five years. That is really unacceptable. There seems to be no good reason except that perhaps these deaths are not regarded as being worthy of being given the same priority as the Government now recognise needs to be given to deaths in the Armed Forces. We should not have a two-tier system of investigations into citizens&#146; deaths, whether they fought for this country or died in prison. People have families and lessons need to be learnt.</p>

<a name="90609-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="090609139000009"></a>I have kept my amendment simple because it can then be taken that an inquest was not held in a timely manner and a hook is available to go to judicial review. So far as I can see, if the process is unfair on a family and an inquest is not held, there is no means of going to judicial review. Although I accept that there may be other ways of doing this&#151;and certainly the solution proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, is elegant because at the least a record should be kept and coroners should notify each other about delays&#151;it may be best to go back to first principles. The Bill ought to recognise that an inquest should be timely.</p>

In this part of the Bill we are concentrating on the substance of coroners&#146; inquiries, the skill and experience of coroners, and so on. However, it is right that we should be attentive to the timeliness of inquests. If we are going to have a Chief Coroner, it seems appropriate that he should have the role of monitoring cases that go on for a considerable amount of time. I regularly read the local press and I always look at the regional news. It is quite remarkable how often families are concerned about the time taken for an inquest to be held. In London we may not feel it so much, but when delays arise you realise how badly this affects families because they cannot see any closure. It is quite traumatic for them. A system of monitoring is right. I

There is nothing unusual in monitoring the progress of cases. The Heads of Division in the High Court each has a responsibility to see that cases are dealt with in a timely fashion. For instance, certainly when I left, civil cases were supposed to be complete within three months. Family cases should be dealt with within one month; that is, judgments had to come out in that length of time. That meant that the judgments had to come out in that sort of time. I can remember spending a considerable amount of time with Ministers discussing the delays in the family courts, particularly delays concerning children, which were monitored very carefully. There is nothing unusual in monitoring. But now that we are to have a new and better system of dealing with coroners, and a Chief Coroner, it would be very important that the Chief Coroner knows, from the moment that the inquest is in its incipient state, when monitoring is likely to be done.</p>

<a name="90609-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="090609139000012"></a>There are all sorts of reasons why cases take a long time. When I sat briefly as an assistant deputy coroner, I was engaged in probably one of the longest of all cases, even before I left it, and other cases have to take a considerable time. It is extremely important that there should be both the requirement of the Chief Coroner to keep an eye on the progress of cases, that individual senior coroners should keep an eye on the cases within their areas, and that the Chief Coroner should know of their progress. Having &#147;timely&#148; in the legislation would be a useful provision for the Chief Coroner, rather than having a judicial review. The effect of judicial review is to slow down a case, rather than to increase its speed. &#147;Timely&#148; would be a useful provision for both the Chief Coroner and for the senior coroner of the area when saying to an assistant coroner, &#147;Perhaps you can let me know how you are getting on, because that is what the legislation requires&#148;.</p>

In another context, Gladstone famously said that justice delayed is justice denied. Any of us who have had any kind of encounter with people who have been waiting for the outcome of coroners&#146; inquiries know that that is very much a feeling that is in their own hearts and minds when they have been bereaved, especially when the circumstances have been tragic. During my time in another place, I was heavily involved with victims of the Hillsborough disaster, and with families whose children&#146;s body parts had been used at the Alder Hey children&#146;s hospital. Noble Lords will recall the trauma that both of those events caused to many of the families involved, and those traumas continue to this day. Delays in dealing with these kinds of tragedies are simply unacceptable, so it seems completely reasonable of my noble friend Lady Finlay to suggest that we should put into the system some requirement to keep a check on where we are in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="090609139000014"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, also made a very good point about the effects of the passage of time. The memories of witnesses and people involved in these events sometimes become clouded, and their evidence is sometimes not so reliable, simply of because of the period that has elapsed since they occurred. So we are putting in place reasonable checks and balances, first, as regards the passage of time and, secondly, to provide for closure. Perhaps, given the suggestion in the second subsection of Amendment 4, that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a><a name="090609139000021"></a>&#147;The Chief Coroner should maintain a register of prolonged investigations&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="090609139000020"></a>it would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister, when he replies to this brief debate, could tell us how long it usually takes. What is the average length of such an inquiry? That would give us some indication of whether there are long delays, and could he tell us not just the average but what are the longest outstanding inquiries currently before coroners?</p>

The Minister wrote to me stating that the overriding aim of the reforms of Part 1 of the Bill is to improve the service that bereaved people, whether service families or otherwise, receive from the coroner system. I am sure that that is the right aim, but at the moment the Bill is missing this important point of timeliness, or some way of ensuring that the bereaved have an awareness of when the coroner inquest will be heard. At the moment, they are left very often with no firm indication of when the inquest will be heard. This is not satisfactory from their point of view.</p>

I start by stating the obvious. No one would disagree with the principle that inquests should be held as soon as possible, as soon as all the relevant information is to hand, and when all related investigations or proceedings have been completed. The average time to complete an inquest is 26 weeks, and the vast majority, 90 per cent, are completed within 12 months of the death. That is an acceptable timescale for the completion of an inquest. It ensures that the families have the opportunity to go through the main challenges of the grieving process and to consider what questions they would like an inquest to answer, before necessarily being confronted by the public nature of those proceedings. We want to ensure that the remaining 10 per cent of inquests are held within a similar timescale wherever possible, providing that the coroner has the appropriate information before him or her.</p>

<a name="90609-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="090609139000017"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said, there are delays for a variety of reasons, very few of which are the responsibility of the coroner. For example, in many cases the coroner may be waiting to hear reports from authorities with a statutory or other duty to investigate the particular death. This might be the Health and Safety Executive, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the transport accident investigation branch, to name a few. Alternatively, the coroner may be awaiting the outcome of criminal proceedings, which generally take precedence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="090609139000018"></a>We have already taken some steps to reduce delays, particularly with regard to inquests into the deaths of military personnel, which we will discuss later. This Bill will bring forward further ways of dealing with backlogs of work and reducing delays. For example, the flexible new appointments process will mean that a local authority can recruit and deploy a pool of assistant coroners to expedite caseloads or to tackle particular peaks of work. This is in addition to the Chief Coroner&#146;s power to transfer cases, which noble Lords have already praised, and the power for coroners to transfer cases between themselves by agreement as a way of tackling backlogs. Coroners will also no longer be restricted to holding inquests within their own areas, if they and their local authority are unable to locate suitable accommodation for the needs of a particular inquest. Clause 24 of the Bill places a statutory duty on local authorities to provide sufficient officers, staff, accommodation and facilities to enable coroners to carry out their functions.</p>

<a name="90609-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="090609139000019"></a>I emphasise that the Bill will not require coroners to do more work per se with the same or fewer resources. The reverse is the case. The introduction of medical examiners will remove a considerable volume of work from coroners, enabling them to focus their resources on the cases for which they have jurisdiction. We estimate that once the role of medical examiner beds down, some 130,000 to 150,000 deaths per year will be referred to coroners, rather than the approximately 235,000 cases per year which are reported to them under the present arrangements. The reduction in that caseload will, we think, lead to significant savings which can be redirected to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the service. So we are confident that the overall effect of this package of measures will ensure that inquests are carried out in both a timely and thorough manner, with quality and the appropriate speed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="090609144000001"></a>On Amendments 4 and 6, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, I can assure her that it is the intention that the Chief Coroner will carry out the functions that she talked about so persuasively. Clause 35(3)(e) sets out that regulations may make provisions giving the Lord Chancellor and the Chief Coroner powers to require information to be provided to them by senior coroners. This will include an annual statistical return, which coroners are required to provide to the Lord Chancellor currently. Within this statistical information is a requirement to report on coroners&#146; oldest cases. We can be confident that the Chief Coroner is likely to want to make inquiries as to the reasons why cases have been apparently delayed, although, as I have pointed out, the responsibility may well be beyond the control of the coroner. I hope that that assists noble Lords in at least appreciating that we see this as a real issue that needs to be sorted out, which we believe that the Bill, as drafted, will do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="090609144000003"></a>I was asked about outstanding cases, some of which go back a long way. That must be because they are exceptional cases. The oldest that I can find relates to Wolverhampton, from June 1998. There are also, from October 1998, North Yorkshire eastern district; Avon, the former county of, December of that year; West Yorkshire western district, May 1999; Surrey, March 2000; Manchester City, July 2000; north-west Wales, January 2001; west London, February 2001; and south London, March 2001. It is possible that some districts, such as north and west Cumbria, have inquests older than March 2001, but only the oldest case is shown in the figures that I have given. I hope that they are helpful to the Committee. We believe that the Bill deals with this problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="090609144000004"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, referred to delays with regard to deaths abroad. It is an important function of the Chief Coroner to co-ordinate requests for information from overseas authorities; it is one of his or her functions. He or she will establish positive relationships, we trust, with overseas authorities&#151;some of which have no knowledge of the roles of coroners&#151;to ensure that there is more likelihood of co-operation. Part of the duty of the Chief Coroner will be to ensure that the service is run effectively and in a timely fashion and that there are no outstanding inquests for which there is no excuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="090609144000009"></a>I was trying to do the sums quickly as he read the figures out and it seems to me that we have nine, possibly 10, inquests that have been opened and outstanding for eight years or more. That is an incredibly long time for a bereaved family. I have a concern that, if only the oldest cases are collected when we collect statistics from coroners, one will miss the shape of the curve and the average may not represent the whole spread. Comparisons need to be drawn between different coroners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="090609144000010"></a>I should like to record my gratitude to Mary Hassell, who is the coroner in Cardiff. She has set herself a general target of clearing inquests within six months, when possible. She has inspired confidence in the medical profession in Cardiff in a way that her predecessors were unable to do. She has engaged in open dialogue and is seen to be very effective. It is interesting that the average for other people is six months; she has set that as her upper limit. It can be done, even in a resource-tight environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="090609144000011"></a>When listening to the Minister, I wondered whether something along the lines of &#147;including information on the effectiveness of the service&#148; could be added to Clause 35(3)(e). Perhaps we should think about coming back to that. In the mean time, I am most grateful for the Minister&#146;s full and comprehensive reply and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

There might, for no apparent reason, be a large number of deaths in

Alternatively, a separate situation might arise whereby the witnesses in a particular inquest, or, indeed, the family, live a long way away from a particular coronial area and it is appropriate to see whether a better way forward would be to give the responsibilities to another coroner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="090609144000015"></a>Of course, we have absolutely no quarrel with this, subject to one caveat, and that is that we believe it critical for the Chief Coroner, before he makes his direction to coroner A, to ensure that the resources at coroner A&#146;s disposal are sufficient for the task that he is about to be given. We see nothing about that in the Bill. That is the background to our amendment, which I beg to move.</p>

I am somewhat concerned, reading the Bill, that the responsibility for coroners of the individual area remains with the local authority and there is not a national coroner set-up, as I know was suggested by Mr Luce and, I think, by Dame Janet Smith. The result is that each individual coroner will be paid for by the area in which he or she will be carrying out his or her duties. Some areas are richer than others. If an area is in financial difficulties or has particular burdens on it&#151;particularly some of the London areas with huge immigration problems&#151;but faces the request that its coroner try a particular case, for some reason, and that case is likely to be long, arduous and expensive, it might well be extremely difficult for that area to deal with the case with the finances available to it. I think that the amendment is extremely sensible in that the practical movement of cases from one area to another should be determined with an eye to whether the area designated as the area in which the coroner tries a case will have the financial resources to do it.</p>

First, I should like to address the resource of the premises available for a coroner to hold an inquest. The coroner is dependent on the local authority for allocating premises that can be used but, sadly, some of the premises are really not fit for purpose. Coroners have to have premises, ideally, where privacy can be observed and where the bereaved are not sitting in a room facing the person whom they believe to be the perpetrator of the death. Coroners need to have facilities where people in wheelchairs can be accommodated and can be heard if they are giving evidence. At the moment, some of the premises are such that somebody is shouting from a wheelchair in the middle of the floor. There are some premises where, by the time you have the interested parties and the press in, one wonders whether it is unsafe. Indeed, sometimes complaints have been made when the coroner, in the name of safety and fire regulations, has called a halt to the number of people who could even come into the room.</p>

<a name="90609-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="090609144000018"></a>If there is a jury present, the premises should allow privacy&#151;not only a room to withdraw in, but privacy to go to the toilet. Some premises have only one male and one female toilet and it is inappropriate for a juror  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_576"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 576</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>potentially to encounter somebody else when they have to go. During the course of a day, jurors are just like anybody else and they will need to go. Some premises do not have appropriate disabled toilets. Another problem can arise when the premises are adjacent to somewhere where there is a noisy activity going on&#151;a dancing class, or whatever. It can be particularly difficult for someone who is deaf to hear proceedings adequately and such noise disturbs the thought processes. These are such serious matters that one feels that they should be heard with a degree of solemnity appropriate to the occasion in an appropriate environment.</p>

<a name="90609-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="090609144000019"></a>The other problem is that the relatives may be elderly, they may be distressed or they may have children in school. If a child knows that the inquest is happening that day into the death of their mum or dad, they deserve to be able to be collected from school, if at all possible, by the parent who is still alive, not farmed out to neighbours, other parents from school, or whatever. For that child, just knowing what is going on that day brings back all their grief. The difficulty is that some premises are difficult to get to by public transport and families without a car can face long travelling times with very sparse bus services if they are travelling from one area to another. We know that, for most of Britain, you can get in and out of London pretty quickly, but getting across country can be more difficult. It can be a similar situation within a coronial jurisdiction. My interest is the south Wales valleys&#151;you can get up and down them very fast, but you certainly cannot get across them with any great ease. I am glad to see the Minister nodding in agreement from his own experience.</p>

<a name="90609-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="090609144000020"></a>The other difficulty, to which the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss alluded, is that the allocation of resources is dependent on the local authority and on the number of deaths. I understand that, if more than 3,000 deaths are referred to a coroner, you get more resources&#151;higher levels of pay&#151;and, below that number, there is a sliding scale. The difficulty is, of course, that in some areas you may get a lot of deaths reported. In one area, a lot of elderly people may die within 24 hours of being admitted to hospital, but those deaths do not require investigation, whereas in another area, where there is a younger population, you may get horrendous crimes, deaths through stabbings, accidents and so on that require investigation, so that the numbers reported to the coroner may be lower but the resources required by those coroners is much higher than in an area with an elderly population.</p>

<a name="90609-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="090609144000021"></a>I should like the coroner to be empowered in the event of there not being appropriate premises. It would be useful if the senior coroner was able to make representation to the relevant authority. My amendment at Clause 24(4) is, indeed, to strengthen those resources. As for benchmarking, which is a word in the amendments, there is a concern that you would benchmark against too low a standard, rather than benchmark against the highest standard, but the idea behind these amendments&#151;I fully accept that the wording of them is not right&#151;is to establish some kind of standard around the resources of all sorts that are available to a coroner so that they can conduct their inquiries appropriately and so that the needs of the bereaved can be genuinely catered for, as was the express intention of the Government when this Bill was introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="090609144000023"></a>My amendment relates to Clause 24, on the provision of staff and accommodation. The clause says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a><a name="090609144000051"></a>&#147;The relevant authority for a coroner area ... must secure&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="090609144000046"></a>the provision of staff and so forth as well as the provision of,</p>
<ul><a name="090609144000053"></a>&#147;accommodation that is appropriate to the needs of those coroners in carrying out their functions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609144000047"></a>I hope, therefore, that in future we shall not have inadequate accommodation. I notice, though, that the clause refers only to the needs of the coroners in carrying out their functions. My amendment would add,</p>
<ul><a name="090609144000054"></a>&#147;and of the families attending the inquest&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609144000024"></a>We have already heard about the understandable traumas suffered by families attending an inquest. The last thing that one wants is to see that trauma exaggerated and exacerbated by inadequate accommodation. It is important that there should be recognition in the Bill that families, or members of the public with a special interest in this, should be catered for as well. That is not there at the moment; the Bill relates only to the coroner&#146;s requirements. One hopes that the coroner might take the view that family accommodation is part of his duties, but it is not clear that that is the case. Will the Minister state categorically that families will be catered for in the accommodation?</p>

What has been said makes it clear that the interests of the bereaved&#146;s next of kin who wish to attend an inquest must be catered for. If we are out to improve the coronial arrangements, which the Bill is directed at achieving, this is one area where that can be done, perhaps by regulations setting some sort of minimum standards for any coroner&#146;s inquest accommodation arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="090609144000027"></a>while the responsibilities of providing staff, accommodation and courts are set out in Clause 24, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, has just spoken. Have the Government carried out any survey of the accommodation that is currently provided? I have experience of an old coroner&#146;s court, local authority accommodation, magistrates&#146; courts and Crown Courts, but I am sure that inquests are held in places that are much less suitable than court buildings. The Government have deliberately, and as a matter of policy, decided not to include coroners within the Courts Service. If there is a survey, can we have some idea what its findings were regarding the provision of accommodation and the necessary adjuncts to it? If that information is not already available, no doubt the Minister can provide it to us by Report.</p>

I shall seek to establish how we intend to make obligations to get resources up to standard and the responsibility that the Chief Coroner will carry with regard to this matter, although the responsibility for actual provision rests locally.</p>

<a name="90609-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="090609144000029"></a>I do not have a national survey to hand, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, may note; I am not sure that there is one, but if there is I will make sure that it is available for later stages of the Bill. It is clear, though, that resources vary between different localities. The burden of the remarks made by all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate is that resources should be available to make the service as effective as possible. I emphasise the point with which I am utterly in agreement: we need to place the interests of the bereaved at the centre of these concerns.</p>

<a name="90609-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="090609144000030"></a>Amendment 5, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, seeks to place an obligation on the Chief Coroner to consider the resources available to the coroner who will receive a transferred case before deciding whether to give a direction requesting that coroner to conduct an investigation into a person&#146;s death. I must emphasise the obvious fact that the issue of funding inquests that have been transferred in the manner mentioned in the amendment will be covered in underpinning regulations. I do not have those regulations to hand at present, but the general principle within them will be that with regard to deaths that occur in England and Wales, the relevant authority for the area in which the coroner would be under a duty to conduct the investigation will continue to be responsible for meeting the costs associated with the case, even if it has to be transferred to a coroner in another area to investigate. For deaths that occur overseas, the local authority for the coroner who is directed by the Chief Coroner to conduct the investigation will be responsible for the costs.</p>

<a name="90609-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="090609144000031"></a>These are general principles only and do not meet the points of detail that have been identified in the amendment. I will go on to those in due course. There may indeed be scenarios where a case is transferred within England and Wales and it is appropriate for the authority of the receiving coroner to meet the costs or for the costs to be shared between the two authorities. These are matters that we will need to work through, given the issues that noble Lords have identified in this debate about the necessity of ensuring that facilities are adequate for the inquest to be held properly.</p>

<a name="90609-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="090609144000032"></a>These principles provide a fair and appropriate way to fund such investigations. With regard to the obvious aspect of inquests into Armed Forces personnel who die on active service overseas, not only will the procedure that we envisage enable cases to be transferred to jurisdictions nearer the home of the bereaved family, thereby meeting the principal point that was adumbrated by several noble Lords in this short debate, but it will relieve some of the funding pressures that jurisdictions such as Oxfordshire or Wiltshire and Swindon have faced in the past while carrying out in such an admirable way&#151;we all applaud and recognise the service that has been provided&#151;the vast majority of inquests that

We are looking to share this burden on the basis that the inquests will be conducted nearer to the homes of those who are bereaved, which bears somewhat on the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, about the problems of travel for the bereaved. I shall come on to that in more detail in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="090609144000033"></a>Amendment 23 and Amendment 79 seek to place an obligation on coroners and the local authorities that fund them to consider the needs of the bereaved when deciding on the location of an inquest. I hope it will be appreciated that this is an important part of how the Bill sets out to provide for the needs of the bereaved. Clause 24 already places a legal obligation on local authorities to provide sufficient coroners&#146; officers and other staff, along with suitable accommodation and facilities to enable the local coroner to carry out all of his or her functions.</p>

<a name="90609-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="090609144000034"></a>The accommodation will need to be adequate for coroners to fulfil their additional obligations under the charter for the bereaved&#151;an important part of the Bill which will be issued under Clause 34. The charter is designed to put bereaved people at the heart of coroners&#146; investigations. It will obligate the coroner to take into account a bereaved family&#146;s views about the timing of an inquest&#151;an important point we have already debated considerably today&#151;as well as providing information to the bereaved about the location of and facilities available at the inquest&#146;s venue. The charter also states that, wherever possible, there should be an appropriate private room for the use of bereaved relatives and that reasonable adjustment will be made&#151;to take the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay&#151;to meet the needs of those with disabilities. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for emphasising that point.</p>

<a name="90609-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="090609144000035"></a>We recognise that we have a great deal of work to do before these charter provisions can be fully met. Officials have already set in train some preparatory work with local authorities to ensure that they are aware of their future responsibilities under the Bill and that they can take steps now to ensure that families are better served than perhaps they have been in the past, as identified by several of the contributions we have heard in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="090609144000036"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, emphasised difficulties with rural communities. I am not sure that my valley was ever green enough to be called a rural community&#151;I hasten to add it is a good deal greener these days with the disappearance of the coal industry. The noble Baroness is right. The difficulties rural communities face in travel can also be reflected in the geographical features of the Welsh valleys and many other places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="090609144000037"></a>There has been a widespread welcome for our plans to move towards a largely full-time coroner service. This will mean an end to some of the existing, smaller jurisdictions. In planning new areas&#151;which will be done in full consultation with the local authorities concerned&#151;the geography of a particular region will need to be taken into account. In the larger geographical regions, the presumption will be that the coroner  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_580"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 580</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>travels to an inquest, rather than that the bereaved family travels to an inquest centre. That is an important principle. To achieve this, it may be that we will retain a small number of part-time coroners, perhaps in support of a full-time senior coroner for an area, so the workload can be appropriately shared and a disproportionate amount of time is not spent travelling.</p>

<a name="90609-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="090609144000038"></a>Amendment 78 seeks to place a requirement on all local authorities to benchmark their provision of staff and accommodation against other coroner areas. In the reformed system to be created by the Bill, it is likely that the Chief Coroner will indeed gather evidence to establish some key national benchmarks on quality, on service levels and on resources. As I mentioned earlier, some of this work can be completed during the implementation period for these reforms.</p>

<a name="90609-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="090609144000039"></a>The Chief Coroner will also have an ongoing monitoring role. In this, he will be assisted by the new independent inspection regime we are proposing under Clause 31. Under this clause Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Court Administration will inspect all coroner areas in England and Wales and will report to the Lord Chancellor and to the Chief Coroner on the administration of the system in different coroner areas. If it appears that there is a problem in any particular area with resources, including accommodation, the Chief Coroner in his or her role as national leader of the coroner system will be able to liaise between coroners and the local authorities that fund them to ensure that, as far as possible, improved resources are made available and that these are used in the most effective way.</p>

It may even be that the Chief Coroner will exercise the option of naming and shaming poorly resourcing authorities if there is no indication of improvement. We hope to bring much greater pressure than has been the case in the past with the individual coroner in a locality wrestling with the issue.

The objective of the Bill is to create a framework in which improvement can be effected. I hope noble Lords will recognise that the Bill faces up to the question of a necessary structure to improve resources. What I hope I have identified as probing amendments can be safely withdrawn on the basis that the Bill significantly addresses these issues.</p>

It struck me that an adequately resourced national coroners service might have been an alternative to carrying on with the finances coming from the local authority. I realise we are not amending the Bill to do that&#151;to move the money out of the local authority and into a national service&#151;but a national service could then have a framework with standards against it. That might make it easier to achieve equity and fairness of provision than by trying to name and shame local authorities which I fear might plead poverty and hold coroners inquests up against things such as educational provision, cleaning streets, et cetera. It might still be quite difficult to improve the service in those areas where it needs to be improved most.</p>

I was indicating that the objective of the Bill is not to calculate resources but to set up a framework by which we can improve the service, identify standards and identify deficiencies against criteria which shift the emphasis more towards the interest and the requirements of the family of the bereaved. Within that framework, we have a structure which can effect significant improvements. We have a little way to go before the Bill becomes an Act, and there are many issues with regard to resources. Let us concentrate, however, as the Bill is meant to do, on the framework which makes proper decision-taking possible and effective. Issues of resources can then follow.</p>

But inquests do not take place in thin air; there has to be somewhere where they occur. As I understand it, the Minister is saying that the Chief Coroner can name and shame local authorities but if they have more urgent calls upon their budget, that is too bad. That leads to what in other contexts we call a postcode lottery. In one area there is an adequate service and adequate provision for a proper hearing, while in another there is not. A local authority can say that it has more pressing needs.</p>

It is quite clear from Clause 3 that they are convinced that it will be necessary, from time to time, to give directions to coroner B for a case to be transferred to coroner A for all the reasons that have been deployed in this debate. It is also quite clear, not only from what has been said but also as a matter of common sense, that there is absolutely no point in making such a direction to coroner B unless the Chief Coroner is convinced that coroner A has the resources to carry out the transferred task. It must follow, must it not, that, before issuing a direction, the Chief Coroner must make a financial assessment about the capacity of coroner A to carry out that task? If that is so, what possible objection can the Government have to our amendment, which says precisely that?</p>

I have listened to a construct of a different basis on which the coroners service could be delivered in terms of a national position. We do not believe that; local authorities have expressed to us their clear interest in the coroners service. Therefore, we are obligated within those terms to seek to improve the structure which governs the service and strengthens the position of the Chief Coroner to bring pressure to bear. Within that framework, I do not deny that the issue of resources will become of some import.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="090609147000008"></a>The noble Lord asks whether it would be possible to transfer a case to a coroner who manifestly does not have the resources to meet that request. In those circumstances, the transfer could not take place. People will act sensibly within these terms, but the concept behind the transfer is to seek ways in which we can make the service more sensitive to the needs of those whom we are seeking to serve. The noble Lord is right that this must be taken into account, but that is different from putting resources in the Bill at this point. This amendment has attracted a number of others concerning resources. I do not cavil at that, because I recognise the importance of the issue, but the noble Lord will appreciate just what it would mean if we had to underpin almost every initiative in the Bill with a clear allocation of where the resource base was. That is not the nature of the way in which we construct legislation.</p>

Nor is he a distributor of all the largesse available for the coroners service; quite the opposite, local authorities are the holders of the funds in those terms. They want to play their part in this. We are concerned that they are able to play their part and to meet standards of service which we want to focus a great deal more on the needs of the bereaved.

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="090609147000022"></a>Amendment 45A requires notification to be given if the body is moved. For the vast majority of bereaved people&#151;I will not say everyone, because there are always exceptions to a 100 per cent rule&#151;the body plays a very important part in their accepting and grieving the death. They want to know where the body is, where the final remains rest. It seems compassionate to let them know if the body has been moved as well.</p>

It also has a bearing on the debate that we have just had, initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. It is really about the movement of cases from one area to another. This idea of notification which is contained here and was implicit in our earlier debates is a good one. My question is about what slack the Minister has identified within the system to make this more than purely an intellectual exercise. Do we know that within the system there are coroners who have the capacity to deal with some of the cases referred to in the last group of amendments and in this one? Therefore, how often is this likely to become a regular exercise or one that might be frequently used?</p>

I do not want to go into the circumstances of that because that is not the purpose of my amendment. The amendment would simply add that where such an undertaking occurs, interested persons should be informed. The interested persons I am particularly concerned about are, of course, the next of kin and close family friends. If a body is to be exhumed, that is not something that any member of a family would consider lightly; it must be a terrifying thought in some circumstances, even if one is anxious to get to the truth. It must be a traumatic experience. It is therefore vital that information of such a sort should be made available immediately to close family and friends. I have used the term &#147;interested person&#148; because there is an interpretation of it in Clause 38 and it seemed useful to use that explanation.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, is right that &#147;interested person&#148; is the accurate definition, and the amendments seek to place on the Chief Coroner and the coroner investigating a death a duty to keep certain interested persons informed of developments in the investigation. The first amendment&#151;the one in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay&#151;extends as a courtesy to interested persons in cases where a case is transferred to another coroner&#146;s area.

Once again, I do not think it is necessary to put it in the Bill. The charter for the bereaved sets out that the coroner will keep the bereaved family informed of developments in the case, particularly relating to post-mortem examinations. This will include both the location of the examination and an explanation of the type of examination that will be carried out.</p>

It has always been the intention that interested persons receive both a copy of the report and the response to it, as is the case under the current rule as we amended it in July 2008. That commitment will be carried forward to the rules to be made under Clause 36. I hope that I can reassure her on that front.</p>

It is not needed in the Bill, because coroners are given a discretionary power to designate a person as interested if they have &#147;sufficient interest&#148; under Clause 38(2)(n). Next of kin who are not specified in Clause 38(2)(a)&#151;that list is extensive&#151;could fall under subsection (2)(n) if the coroner felt that they had the required level of interest in the investigation. All categories of people who would have sufficient interest in the matter are covered.</p>

<a name="90609-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="090609150000011"></a>In the early days, there was great concern not only because of delays resulting from the impact on coroners in particular areas of the country where bodies were repatriated&#151;that was bad enough, but I shall not dwell on it now&#151;but also because the coroners did not then have the expertise which several have now acquired. A military ethos informs the way in which people who died in conflict are dealt with, making it quite different from the normal duties that are required of a coroner in civil society. It was easy for the families in those early days to feel that the coroner concerned did not have a sufficient grip on what it was all about. Above all, where embarrassment to the Government was caused by the death of servicemen, it was felt that it would be relatively easy for officials to&#151;how shall I put it tactfully?&#151;pull the wool over the eyes of an inexperienced coroner.</p>

<a name="90609-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="090609150000012"></a>Several coroners now are extremely competent and very well versed in the needs of a military inquest. They certainly have not been afraid on occasions to point the finger of blame at, let us say, inadequate protection for a servicemen through no body armour being available, or perhaps inadequate vehicles which have then been the subject of enemy fire. A very tricky coroner&#146;s inquest can take place.</p>

<a name="90609-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="090609150000013"></a>The thrust of the new clause and the amendments grouped with it is the absolute necessity for that expertise not to be lost, which means proper training for any coroners who undertake military inquests. Several bites at the same cherry have been presented and I hope that the Minister might be persuaded to take up at least one of them. He has a choice of which ones he might like, including the amendment in this group in the name of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, who will, I am sure, speak in due course.</p>

<a name="90609-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="090609150000014"></a>My favoured one is Amendment 114, which asks for one deputy chief coroner to be appointed with specific responsibility for overseeing military inquests and the training of all coroners undertaking military inquests. I put it like that because it is very important that somebody near the top of the system has a specific role and duty and can then undertake the training of other coroners. The key point is for there to be somebody near the top of the pile with that duty imposed on him. That is why I have suggested one deputy chief coroner with that particular duty.</p>

<a name="90609-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="090609150000015"></a>I hope I can persuade the Minister that this is important. I gathered at Second Reading that he takes the view that there is a general duty of training in the Bill and that it is sufficient for the purpose. My view&#151;very firmly held&#151;is that it is not sufficient. It needs to be written into the Bill because time passes, people forget and expertise is lost, so we need something to pin it all in place. For that reason, I feel strongly that there should be something in the Bill that can be there for a considerable time. I assume that we are unlikely to see another coroners Bill in my lifetime, and certainly not in the near future. This is our sole opportunity to make sure that it is right. Therefore, I warmly recommend at least one of these amendments to the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

They all have a similar thrust. My choice of location in the Bill was driven by the fact that line 22 of page 8 has the phrase:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_91"></a><a name="090609150000083"></a>&#147;Death of service personnel abroad&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609150000017"></a>I do not necessarily hold to that as the right place to put it, but it is very important that there is something in the Bill. The Committee is well aware of the problems that have arisen in dealing with inquests of service personnel tragically killed overseas. As I mentioned at Second Reading, it has taken some years to get satisfactory arrangements made. Only after a considerable time did coroners, particularly in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire, build up considerable experience in dealing with military deaths. This experience is now widely recognised and valued.</p>

<a name="90609-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="090609150000018"></a>There are no indications that the active use of forces overseas will be dramatically cut in the near future. In the past month alone, 12 more operational deaths have occurred in Afghanistan. We must brace ourselves for the possibility of significant further deaths in the coming months and years. In Command Paper 7424, entitled <I>The Nation&#146;s Commitment: Cross-</I><I>G</I><I>overnment Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans</I>, the Government undertook to provide fair treatment for our Armed Forces because of the unique nature of their service to the nation. Surely it follows that the maintenance of expertise to hold inquests on service personnel in the coronial service is not only essential but should rightly be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90609-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="090609150000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bach, wrote to me on 22 May, following Second Reading, and his letter is in the Library. He sought to reassure me that measures in the Bill will,</p>
<ul><a name="090609150000086"></a>&#147;strengthen investigations into military deaths&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609150000020"></a>I read the Bill closely and did feel great confidence that military deaths would be better investigated, based on what was in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, also said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_92"></a><a name="090609150000084"></a>&#147;As indicated in paragraph 56 of our draft charter for the bereaved, we expect the Chief Coroner to issue guidance to coroners about investigations into deaths of service personnel on active service&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609150000021"></a>This, he said, combined with the training of coroners and their officers, for which the Chief Coroner will be responsible, will ensure that,</p>
<ul><a name="090609150000087"></a>&#147;all coroners are able to conduct effective investigations into deaths of service personnel&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609150000022"></a>In his next sentence the Minister says that an extremely complex investigation could be transferred by the Chief Coroner to a coroner with the necessary skills and experience. Surely this last sentence acknowledges that there is a need for the necessary skills and experience. Indeed, it effectively contradicts his previous assertion that the Chief Coroner will ensure that all coroners are able to conduct effective investigations.</p>

<a name="90609-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="090609150000023"></a>I looked at the latest version of the draft charter for the bereaved. Incidentally, the introduction to the charter states that the new Chief Coroner will probably want to consult again before the reforms are implemented in full in two or three years&#146; time. This is hardly a definition for firm action on the day that the Bill becomes law, which is, I believe, what is required.  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_590"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 590</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Paragraph 56, to which the Minister refers, says that the Chief Coroner will be responsible for setting national minimum standards across a range of coroners&#146; functions. In terms of services to bereaved families, this could include standards in relation to particular types of death or suspected death, such as deaths on active military service. This is but one example. The draft goes on to specify a variety of other causes of death, such as death as a result of atrocities or other disasters; death from particular illnesses such as epilepsy and sudden adult death syndrome; and death apparently resulting from suicide. These, the draft charter says, are matters for the Chief Coroner to determine when he or she is appointed.</p>

<a name="90609-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="090609150000024"></a>Paragraph 57 of the same draft charter says that this is only a draft and is intended as a guide for those with an interest in the kind of service that it is envisaged will be provided by the reformed service. Surely this is just not good enough. We must seek an amendment to the Bill that gives clear instruction to the Chief Coroner to provide for and maintain the necessary expertise in service inquests, which experience over the past few years has shown to be essential and of particular importance to the next of kin of those who have so tragically lost their lives at a young age. Command Paper 7424 was introduced and debated with much fanfare in this House. The noble Baroness, Lady Taylor of Bolton, said that the Government were unashamedly setting out to provide special consideration for the Armed Forces and their families. The draft charter for the bereaved, on which the Minister wishes to rely, is far too generalised. It lumps military inquests together with a whole variety of others and is not just geared to the particular and present-day needs of military inquests. I urge the Minister and the Government to reconsider this issue.</p>

In other parts of the Bill we will look at the expertise, experience and training of medical examiners. I know that people in judicial positions are always a little more reserved about training or particular qualifications. It seems to us that much has changed in this area. The noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, mentioned the fact that we do not come to legislation on coroners terribly frequently. A great deal has happened since any previous look at the service. A great deal has also happened in terms of the military and war.</p>

<a name="90609-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="090609150000026"></a>First, 30 years ago there would have been many more people who had experience of service. As time goes on, the number of people serving in the military goes down and the direct experience and understanding of what being in a war is about gradually becomes more specialised. Secondly, war itself is becoming a very different and highly technical business. Issues of injury, death and the experience of protection have changed dramatically. Often, those who are far from theatre but see it on a television screen may feel that it is more like a video game than what it is really like in situ.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="090609150000027"></a>Military law and international law relating to conflict have changed dramatically over the past 10 years or so. This whole area has changed dramatically in many

It is extremely difficult to see how coroners in general could hope to understand all these areas in sufficient detail and depth to be able to deal satisfactorily with them when these matters arise. In so many aspects of professional life we are very much aware that there has to be a degree of specialisation and expertise. Although we have not tabled amendments on this issue, we saw that this opportunity would arise for the Minister to respond to these thoughtful propositions&#151;this menu of opportunities&#151;and we look forward to hearing what he has to say. We want to identify ourselves with the concern that expertise and specialisation are necessary.</p>

However, we are at war in Afghanistan and in Iraq and our soldiers have lost their lives there. As the noble Lord said, it is important that we should not forget the reasons why they laid down their lives. Society at large should constantly be made aware of the sacrifice and the nature of those deaths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="090609150000029"></a>Listening to my noble and gallant friend Lord Craig of Radley, who himself gave such outstanding service in the Royal Air Force, I reflected that an uncle of mine had died serving in the Royal Air Force in the Second World War and how important it was for my generation to know the circumstances in which that death occurred. Indeed, my 12 year-old son returned yesterday from a school trip to the Somme where the pupils looked at the circumstances that led to so many deaths during the battles that occurred there in 1916. Each of those children consulted records to look at the lives and deaths of the soldiers who had attended their school before travelling to the Somme. No one is more aware than the noble Lord, Lord Bach, of the importance of recollection, given his experience of dealing frequently with many of these instances at the Dispatch Box. It is significant that he has been joined by his noble friend Lady Taylor, who holds this responsibility today and so frequently has to remind the House of the price that has been paid by our servicemen.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="090609150000030"></a>Therefore, it is important that we should know why people have died and how they have died, and that that knowledge should not be lost. How it is recorded is therefore extraordinarily important. As is so often the case, the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, has done the Committee a great service by bringing forward this amendment to ensure that we adequately debate this matter. I very much liked what she had to say and the spirit in which she said it, asking the Minister not necessarily to agree with the wording of the amendment but to look for words that will achieve her objectives, one of which is training and the assurance that expertise will not be lost as the number of people who are able competently to deal with such very specialist inquiries may have to be narrowed down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="090609150000031"></a>In the earlier debate, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, referred to local authorities, some of which were mentioned by my noble and gallant friend, such as Wiltshire where bodies have been flown back.

Is there not an inherent contradiction in this argument? If that is to be the case, the very expertise that my noble and gallant friend has identified will clearly not be available in other parts of the country if such inquiries are sent there in the future. Will the Minister dwell for a moment on what will happen if coroners sitting in the future have not had the training or developed the expertise identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, in moving these amendments?</p>

It so happens that this Bill comes before us when we are engaged in fighting a formidable foe who appears to be well armed and getting increasing supplies from some sources. We read, sadly, of the deaths of our troops, particularly due to roadside bombs and suicide attacks. It is a formidable campaign in which to be involved. It is wholly appropriate that the Bill should reflect the times in which we live and show sensitivity to the issue of having coroners in charge of the inquests who are fully up to speed with the type of case with which they will have to deal. I suggest that we owe it to our troops and their families&#151;those already afflicted with grief and those who may suffer in the future&#151;to have a Bill that shows that we are aware of the risks being run.</p>

I understand the wish of the noble Baroness and of the noble and gallant Lord to ensure that in a reformed coroners system we do not lose that expertise that has been built up by, for example, the coroners for the counties of Wiltshire and Oxfordshire. Amendment 6A aims to ensure that, where an investigation is transferred from one coroner to a coroner in a different area for whatever reason, the coroner to whom the case is transferred has had appropriate training on investigations into service personnel deaths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="090609150000036"></a>Amendment 37 aims to ensure that a cohort of coroners has the necessary skills to carry out investigations into service personnel deaths.

Amendment 114 would make a deputy chief coroner responsible for overseeing military inquests and training coroners who undertake them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="090609150000037"></a>There was a backlog. That was caused to some extent because the decision to repatriate all service fatalities initially via RAF Brize Norton in the Oxfordshire coroner&#146;s jurisdiction created a singular and exceptional burden there. We would expect a coroner to be able to complete a routine inquest within six months of its opening. As the Committee well knows, inquests of service personnel can be more complex with a timeframe of around nine to 12 months from the date of death to the hearing of the inquest. Delays are often due to necessary Ministry of Defence investigations, especially service inquiries, and sometimes at the request of the family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="090609150000038"></a>As we know, coroners are funded by local authorities, but extra resources from government have been provided to Oxfordshire, Wiltshire and Swindon coroners for inquests for service personnel killed on operations overseas. Both my department and the Ministry of Defence have looked at what else can be done to speed up the processes&#151;for example, reviewing service inquiry procedures. The MoD established a Defence Inquests Unit in June last year, whose key role is to assist coroners and to progress internal investigation reports to prevent avoidable delays to inquests. The Ministry of Defence has also provided additional logistical support for bereaved families, which I shall not go into now.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="090609150000039"></a>I reassure the Committee that, even without these amendments, measures in the Bill will mean that all coroners will be not only able, as my letter to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, said, but also equipped to deal with service personnel inquests. I want to offer what reassurance I can that the broad policy under a reformed coroner system will be that coroners in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire will continue to be responsible for leading investigations in the tragic event of incidents overseas involving service personnel that lead to two or more fatalities.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="090609150000040"></a>I say in passing that the coroner for Wiltshire, Mr David Masters, who has conducted many of the most recent inquests and who has been praised by local Members of Parliament during Commons stages of the Bill, retired on 1 April. However, we understand that the new coroner for that county has appointed him as an assistant deputy for the specific purpose of continuing to preside over these cases.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="090609150000041"></a>I said that incidents involving overseas personnel that lead to two or more fatalities will be looked at by coroners in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire. However, there may be exceptions to this. For example, if the families of the two or more fatalities are from Scotland or Northern Ireland, it may be more convenient for a fatal accident inquiry or inquest to take place there.  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_594"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 594</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We shall need to have much more detailed discussions about these matters to establish suitable protocols before the Bill is implemented.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="090609150000042"></a>There are measures in the Bill to ensure that any coroner is equipped to deal with an investigation into the death of a single soldier in the event that responsibility for the investigation of a particular death is transferred to another coroner nearer to where the deceased&#146;s family lives. Perhaps I may give some examples. First, one of the key roles of the Chief Coroner will be to issue guidance to coroners and their staff about investigations into certain types of death. This will include the deaths of those on active service. Paragraph 56 of our draft charter for the bereaved has already been mentioned by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig. Secondly, the Chief Coroner will make regulations concerning the training required by all coroners and their officers and other staff. I can confirm to the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, that this will almost certainly include training for those with responsibility for investigations into military deaths. These measures will ensure that all coroners are able to conduct effective investigations into the deaths of service personnel.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="090609150000043"></a>However, if there were an extremely complex investigation, under Clause 3 of the Bill the Chief Coroner would be able to transfer the investigation to a coroner with the necessary experience or, under Schedule 8, to a particularly experienced judge, former judge or former coroner. I am afraid that I cannot accept that there is a contradiction between our assertion that all coroners will have the skills and experience necessary to conduct investigations into the deaths of service personnel and, on the other hand, our recognition that there will be exceptional, complex cases that will need to be handled in a different way. Those exceptional cases might involve, for example, multiple fatalities, which would sensibly be handled by a coroner who has conducted such investigations in the past. Those cases will be quite different from routine cases&#151;if any such case can be described as routine&#151;which any coroner should, with training, be able to handle.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="090609150000044"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, suggested that one deputy chief coroner should have oversight of military inquests. On balance, we do not believe that that is necessary because the Chief Coroner, as part of his or her leadership role for the service, would almost certainly want to be satisfied personally that all investigations and training were being carried out to the highest possible standard in line with the relevant rules, regulations and guidance.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="090609150000045"></a>The overriding aim of the reforms in Part 1 of the Bill is to improve the service that bereaved people, whether service families or otherwise, receive from the coroner system. We are confident that, taken together, the measures in the Bill will strengthen investigations into military deaths. When I had the privilege of serving at the Ministry of Defence, I saw at first hand fatalities being brought back to Brize Norton as a consequence of the Iraq war. That is something that will stick in my memory, as it will with anyone who was at Brize Norton on one of those occasions. Therefore, I do not need to be persuaded about how serious a matter this is and how fundamental it is to the way in which we approach things. However, we do not consider

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="090609150000049"></a>The whole House is united in its praise for our Armed Forces, especially the teeth arms, the fighting troops who over the past 10 years and more have been deployed continuously on operations of a particularly ferocious nature. Our fighting troops have exceeded all our expectations and they are an example to the entire country of unselfishness, modesty and courage in an age when these qualities are extremely hard to find.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_596"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 596</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90609-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="090609150000050"></a>Morale is high in the fighting forces. I hope that they all realise that they are held in the highest affection and respect by the public of this country. Such relentless war fighting brings a terrible toll, not only in deaths, but also severe injuries. Due to the miracles of modern medicine many men are alive today who, even 10 or 20 years ago, would have died from their wounds. Some of these wounds are very severe indeed. There are many men in fighting formations, returning from operations having lost two or three limbs and taken other horrendous injuries.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="090609150000051"></a>As I have said, morale and esprit de corps is high. It is high because there is essentially immense loyalty and comradeship within the fighting regiments or corps of our Armed Forces. In the majority of cases, severely wounded men want to be with their own comrades. Furthermore, their own comrades want them back. It would be a mistake for anyone to underestimate the fact that this is very much a two-way process. Those severely wounded men need their comrades and their comrades most certainly need them.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="090609150000052"></a>I should put on record the gratitude and admiration we all have for the wonderful medial staff who attend to our Armed Forces, both in the theatre of operations and back here in the United Kingdom at places like Selly Oak and Headley Court. These medical teams are an integral part of the family of the Armed Forces. They are hugely trusted and admired within the Armed Forces, as are the physiotherapists and others who help our fighting troops cope with the trauma of warfare. On this matter, I hope that the Minister will be able to tell the House what is being provided for our severely wounded personnel in terms of retraining and re-skilling.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="090609150000053"></a>There are no golden rules in dealing with the trauma of war. Each individual has his own way of endeavouring to cope. The traditional British way is to treat adversity with humour and self-deprecation, putting so far as possible the tragedies and atrocities of war out of one&#146;s mind. I understand that the Armed Forces are rightly treating severely wounded personnel sensitively and with understanding. These people have much to offer. They can work in administrative and clerical roles. Furthermore, there are many tasks within a unit that they can perform. Their numbers, understandably, should not count towards the fighting strength of the unit because they cannot be deployed on operations. Nevertheless, there are many roles that they can fulfil back at a unit&#146;s headquarters.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="090609150000054"></a>I understand from my own inquiries that the first three or four years following a severe injury are crucial in coping with the physical and psychological change necessitated by severe injury, getting used to artificial limbs and disabilities. Some severely injured troops may wish to leave the service early, but the vast majority wish to stay, certainly for some years. A good many severely wounded troops find that, after two or three years, when their comrades have moved on to different units, been promoted or taken a different specialisation, they themselves feel that it is time for change and often wish to opt to leave the service. The point is that there are no hard and fast rules. Each individual&#146;s needs must be met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="090609150000055"></a>The television, national press and local and regional press throughout the country are greatly supportive of our Armed Forces. Our local papers and regional newspaper in the south-west, the <I>Western Morning News</I>, all do an excellent job, providing the public with news and comment, both locally and from the frontline. I was delighted to see in the library a copy of the <I>Courier and Advertiser</I> of 29 May, a Dundee edition&#151;I believe that this is the local paper of the noble Lord, Lord Lyell&#151;providing an extensive coverage of the 45 Commando Royal Marines medal ceremony. It was instructive to see on the front page of that paper a photograph of a wounded man forming up with his unit to receive his campaign medal with his comrades.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="090609150000056"></a>I would like to pay tribute to our national papers as well, particularly the so-called popular press for doing much to highlight the positive contributions that severely injured servicemen make. My attention was drawn to an article on page 13 of the<I> S</I><I>un</I> on 1 June this year. Prince Harry was in New York and with him, as his co-ambassador, was marine Joe Townsend, who had lost both of his legs. Many service charities, including the exemplary Help for Heroes, have every reason to be grateful to our wounded servicemen for their selfless dedication in fundraising and the other efforts that they make.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="090609150000057"></a>Great British corps and regiments are like large extended families. When you join one of our elite corps or regiments, you are in it for life. In my own corps, there is an expression that is as true today as it ever was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_93"></a><a name="090609150000085"></a>&#147;Once a marine, always a marine&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609150000077"></a>We have our own magazine, the <I>Globe and Laurel</I>, a wonderful magazine, referred to in the services as the &#147;Globe and Buster&#148;. We have a vast network of Royal Marine associations throughout the country and overseas. These also form part of the support network. The irony is that often the very severely injured and wounded are doing a great deal themselves to support others. It is exemplary to see what they do and what they are capable of doing. As I have said earlier, it is two-way traffic. These men are needed in the service.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="090609150000058"></a>My understanding is that the additional funding required in respect of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have come out of central government funds and not Ministry of Defence funding. The funding for this vital work to which I have referred should also come from central Government and not be taken out of the Ministry of Defence budget. We owe all our Armed Forces a debt of honour. We owe those severely wounded and injured a debt of honour that we can never repay. We must, however, spare no effort or cost in supporting them.</p>

I was much struck by the turnout to welcome back the recently returned Commando Helicopter Force from RNAS Yeovilton a couple of Fridays ago as they paraded through the west country town near our own home. It is not just a matter of a celebration; it was a matter of concern for those people who had suffered.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="090609150000060"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Burnett, is absolutely right that the Government and the taxpayer should do more to help those hurt returning warriors. The charitable and voluntary sectors have a very important role, too. The noble Lord, Lord Burnett, referred to the heroes&#146; organisation. As always however, it seems that the more visible the need there is the relatively easier it is to raise funds. It is a truism of fundraising, I am told, that it is much easier to raise money&#151;and I do not seek to be frivolous&#151;for guide dogs than it is for Alzheimer&#146;s disease sufferers, let alone the carers of Alzheimer&#146;s disease sufferers.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="090609150000061"></a>I suspect that the same is true for injured warriors and the terrible loss of limbs from which many suffer. But for those with mental health problems&#151;sometimes those who have sustained injury have sustained mental health problems as well&#151;I suspect that it is much more challenging for voluntary organisations to raise the necessary funds. On my way home from your Lordships' House at night, I see in the doorways of shops opposite the New Scotland Yard building, that great fortified fortress, some of those who may fall into the returned servicemen category. I am not sure, but I suspect that some of them do.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="090609150000062"></a>Not long ago&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, will probably be saddened to hear this, as I was to see it&#151;I saw an ex-Royal Marine squatting on the pavement in Cheapside in the City of London, hard by St Paul's, begging. I thought that there must be something terribly wrong with the support structure that has allowed someone to end up doing that. I am sure from my observation, not from my discussion, that mental health problems were part of his problem. I suspect that; I do not know.</p>

<a name="90609-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="090609150000063"></a>I know that organisations such as the Royal British Legion and Combat Stress do much, but we now have much larger numbers of individuals requiring help not just with physical injury but with stress and with coming to terms with returning to what is no longer normality for them&#151;and at an earlier stage. The clear public policy benefit of an early &#147;cause not symptom&#148; approach is that it is likely to be quicker, more effective and cheaper. There is little merit in waiting until the returned warrior with those problems has gone all down the ladder to, say, begging on the pavement in Cheapside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="090609150000064"></a>Some returning servicemen may have no physical but deep mental scars. I hope that various of our elite corps to whom the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, referred, would welcome them to come back to help in regimental headquarters, or wherever, with suitable training and help, just as much as those who suffered physical injury. Those mental scars make it difficult for them to cope in broader UK society following their removal from the services&#146; structure, which has often been their  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_599"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 599</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>family, as it were, since their teens. That is as true for those with mental problems as it is for those with physical problems. I echo everything that the noble Lord said about those with physical problems. On coming out of the armed services, that can be compounded by a lack of real perceived support, respect or appreciation for what has been done to those people while serving.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="090609150000065"></a>The consequences can be very difficult: broken family networks, unemployment and the homelessness to which I have already alluded. I am told that perhaps a quarter of London's homeless are ex-service. It is a deep stain on our nation&#151;of how we have allowed them to fall through the net&#151;for the need in all cases is to develop skills to cope. The noble Lord, Lord Burnett, was surely right to say that regimental headquarters and others welcoming back those who suffer physical disability, albeit for a transitional period of perhaps three or four years until others have moved on, as he illustrated, will help people who have come back with those injuries to cope and eventually to re-enter civilian life on a gentle glide path. We have the same need to help those with mental problems to cope better and to help them with alternative personal support networks to try to deal effectively with the emotional causes rather than the symptoms.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="090609150000066"></a>Whatever the case&#151;I am manifestly not an expert in this&#151;new organisations are springing up all the time. There are one or two very effective pioneering charities. I think of the newly formed Warrior Programme. It has already demonstrated significant success in a small number of cases in helping ex-service personnel with emotional and mental health issues. The Warrior organisation, which I commend to the Minister&#151;and others like it&#151;needs two things: first, a little support to trial its innovative programmes on a wider scale; and, secondly, help to make its interventions, along with more established organisations such as the Royal British Legion, available across the services. More money will help, but so will more co-ordination. Access for returning warriors&#151;knowing where to turn at any stage&#151;is very difficult. It needs to be integrated, because the current response, just because so many are trying to help, including of course the MoD, is often fragmented. It is difficult for individuals to find it when they come out. That is a task that we can reasonably ask the Ministry of Defence to turn to. I know that organisations such as Warrior want to work closely with the ministry.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="090609150000067"></a>We will, I suspect, see wars continuing. We will also, I am told, in these recessionary times, see more young men and young women joining up, for a whole host of reasons, to the armed services. They may have had an unstable childhood. They often want to escape poverty&#151;they simply want a job. They want security; they want another family which, as the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, so clearly illustrated, the armed services&#151;whether the Royal Marines or whomsoever else&#151;so often provide. Sometimes they simply have a burning ambition.</p>

<a name="090609150000070"></a><b><a name="90609-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090609150000112"></a>Lord Lyell:</b> My Lords, I rise with apologies for the second time in my career in your Lordships' House, because I did not think that I would have the opportunity to be here tonight to support the noble Lord, Lord Burnett. For that reason, I apologise to your Lordships for not having my name on the list, but I shall be very brief and give enormous thanks to one or two Members of your Lordships' House tonight. First, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, for giving us the opportunity to debate this wide-ranging subject. He and other noble Lords may know this, but I declare an interest as secretary of the House of Lords defence group, which is tactfully known at level five, as the noble Baroness will know, as the warlords, but I am certainly one of the tamer ones. I have to say what enormous help Members of your Lordships' House who are interested in defence receive from the noble Baroness and, at the outset, I would like to say how grateful I am, because many of my remarks have been based on the help that she and the department have been able to give.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="090609150000071"></a>I have a minor personal interest. My noble friend Lord Astor and the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, were professional regular soldiers. I am now into my eighth decade, which indicates that I was a conscript for two years of National Service. I served only 19 months of that because, on 20 January 1959, I took a particularly foolish injury when skiing, which caused me to be in plaster for an entire summer and most of the autumn, with remedial treatment. I found that I was not getting better and I spent the summer of 1960 once again in the care of physiotherapists and medics. I am not necessarily one to speak, because two miles from where I had my appalling accident, my noble friend Lord Astor also had an accident, so he, too, will speak from some experience tonight.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="090609150000072"></a>I know what I and, I am sure, my noble friend, felt. It was not just the physical repair but, as my noble friend Lord Patten described it, it is what I think he called stress. We find it popularly termed in the media as trauma&#151;that, indeed, is the transatlantic term&#151;but it is pure stress. Now if I, let alone my noble friend, felt it, then think what all of those brave young men and women have had: a serious problem, not only of physical injury but of what my noble friend Lord Patten so eloquently put out.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="090609150000073"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Burnett, was kind enough to refer to 45 Commando, and I had the good luck to go to Arbroath on 29 May. What struck me there was that not just older citizens like me, who might have appreciated what I hope I may call our Commando in the county of Angus, but also all the youngsters&#151;younger schoolchildren, college students, teenagers and late teenagers&#151;were really impressed and proud to see all

Some, alas, were injured, as the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, said, but he pointed out what we were able to see in the <I>Courier</I>. We were, once again, able to see young Marines, using all sorts of prosthetics, as I think they are called, and serious assistance for their appalling injuries, receiving their medals.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="090609150000074"></a>Thanks to the noble Baroness and her department, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, and I all had the chance to visit Selly Oak in March 2007. I think that was when her department was beginning to take the first steps in returning servicemen with pretty serious injuries. They came back to Selly Oak, which was not receiving the greatest publicity then; happily, we three who were there were able to rebut a good bit of that, and I am confident that enormous improvements are being made. I look forward to hearing what the noble Baroness will say in due course.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="090609150000075"></a>Also, thanks to the noble Baroness, our group visited Headley Court in June 2008. I hope that your Lordships will bear with me on this, but we were absolutely shattered by the unbelievable courage and, if I might be forgiven a slightly unlordly comment, sheer guts of all the young men and quite a few young women who were there. They were determined to follow exactly what the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, has said; they wished 110 per cent to return, as far as was humanly possible, to their service life because they missed it and all the points of comradeship that the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, mentioned. They wanted to get that back.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="090609150000076"></a>However, as my noble friend Lord Patten said, it is not just the physical injuries; it is the stress. I know that the noble Baroness will be able to give us some encouraging news on that when she replies. For my part, I certainly thank her for everything that she does. I also thank my noble friend Lord Astor and, if I may call him my noble friend, the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, for giving us the opportunity to discuss this tonight. I apologise to your Lordships for I thought that I would be away, therefore I am an intruder. That is enough.</p>

He is a former serving officer in the Royal Marines, so his words obviously carry considerable authority and weight. I very much support the thrust of my noble friend&#146;s contribution, but obviously I do not intend to repeat all his arguments.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="090609154000002"></a>Our Armed Forces are held in the highest esteem by the general public, by the media and at Westminster. Although we may have political disputes on particular conflicts or procurement programmes or, indeed, on the overall level of defence expenditure, our admiration, respect and appreciation of those who take up arms for our country transcend party politics and unite us all. Sadly, of course, many lay down their lives and make the supreme sacrifice, but many more are wounded or disabled. Lay people are often amazed by the desire of those who recover to operational fitness to return  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_602"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 602</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to conflict and fight alongside their comrades, as has been said. Thankfully, medical advances over the years make that increasingly possible.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="090609154000003"></a>However, for those who, unfortunately, do not fully recover, it makes much sense to do everything possible to find them a worthwhile role back with their corps or regiment, perhaps in some form of supportive but not combative role. As my noble friend said, that obviously helps their rehabilitation, rebuilds their confidence and self-esteem and, as the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, said, restores a sense of community and comradeship. We have to convince them of what is true, which is that they can continue to play a necessary part in their unit&#146;s efficiency and success. As the noble Lord, Lord Patten, said, we do not want to see our ex-service personnel being homeless, on the streets begging or, perhaps, in prison where so many, sadly, end up. Equally, it has to be to the advantage of their operational colleagues to know that they would be looked after with onward career opportunities were they to succumb to severe wounding or disability themselves.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="090609154000004"></a>I have four questions for the Minister. First, is there a single booklet or similar that is made available to such personnel giving details of supportive career opportunities and where and how they can access the relevant training and the financial support to undertake it? Secondly, does the Ministry of Defence have any records of the number of personnel serving in the three services so redeployed after severe injury or disability, whether that be of a physical or mental nature? The noble Lord, Lord Patten, increasingly focused his remarks on the mental situation. Thirdly, how positively are commanding officers encouraged and, indeed, expected to provide career opportunities in the circumstances that we are discussing tonight, albeit acknowledging possible financial constraints and their prime responsibility of delivering an effective operating force? Fourthly, I refer to something that I read relatively recently. Professor Alexander McFarlane, the head of the Australian Centre for Military and Veterans&#146; Health, said that Australia and America were better at supporting their soldiers when they returned from conflict than we were. I should be grateful if the noble Baroness could look into this fairly serious assertion.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, that his noble friend&#146;s distinguished service with the Royal Marines fully qualifies him to be taken very seriously by the House tonight. As the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, said, many men are alive today due to the miracles of modern medicine, but many of them are seriously wounded. Most want to be with their comrades and, as the noble Lord said, their comrades want them back. I also agree with the noble Lord that most units and regiments are like extended families&#151;when you join, you are in for life. I am very proud that my former regiment, the Household Cavalry, which has suffered a number of deaths and serious injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan, like the Royal Marines has active associations both in this country and overseas

I know that the same applies to the Household Division, in which my noble friend Lord Lyell served.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="090609154000006"></a>Can the Minister tell the House how many members of the British Armed Forces have been seriously injured in the past 12 months? As the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, asked, do the Government keep records of the number of service personnel serving with their original regiments or units in administrative or clerical roles since being wounded or disabled while on active service? Are any programmes in place to allow and indeed encourage wounded soldiers who wish to continue serving to stay with their units? We on these Benches welcome any progress to enable wounded soldiers to continue serving.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="090609154000007"></a>Although that is paramount, it is also vital that wounded soldiers, after leaving military care facilities such as Headley Court and Selly Oak, have access to proper civilian healthcare. Can the noble Baroness tell the House what government procedures are in place to ease the transition from military to civilian healthcare for disabled soldiers? What programmes are used to facilitate greater co-operation and communication between the Ministry of Defence and the NHS? I should like also to join the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, in paying tribute to our local and national newspapers and the television for highlighting the very positive contributions that severely injured servicemen can make.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="090609154000008"></a>Many years ago, Lord Nelson said that this country expects every man to do his duty. Two hundred years on, our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are still responding to the call and many are being severely wounded in the defence of this country. The difference is that our Government expect a first-rate military on a second-rate budget. After a decade of Labour&#146;s neglect, our military is overstretched, undermanned and in possession of worn-out equipment. It is our duty to ensure that these brave heroes who fight on our behalf receive proper care and recognition both for operational requirements and, as my noble friend Lord Patten said, for urgent post-operational requirements.</p>

It is appropriate that we remind ourselves of the ultimate sacrifice that they have each made, and our sympathies are certainly with their families this evening. This is a salutary reminder of the very harsh consequences of the operations in which we are involved, and of course one of the consequences of those operations is the issue of injured service personnel that the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, has raised today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="090609154000010"></a>The whole House has expressed its appreciation to him for securing this short debate to ensure that we are taking the right steps to provide opportunities for service personnel who are severely wounded or disabled while on active service. Noble Lords have mentioned the need to help them remain with their corps, their regiment or their units, in administrative or clerical roles, if they cannot return to their former duties. We are very clear that that is a desirable objective. It is also important that the House realises that we do not think that there is one approach that fits every individual, because these people should be treated as individuals, and the response should be tailored to their needs as much as possible.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="090609154000011"></a>We accept absolutely our responsibility to provide effective medical and health support to our people. The support to personnel injured on operations is, I think everyone agrees, of an excellent standard. That is not just my view. The National Audit Office noted in its May report that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94"></a><a name="090609154000028"></a>&#147;The Department&#146;s success in delivering lifesaving medical treatment is underlined by the number of &#145;unexpected survivors&#146; following the most severe of injuries&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609154000027"></a>Noble Lords have mentioned that those who might have died just five or 10 years ago are being kept alive today by the remarkable services that we now have. We should all pay tribute to the medical teams who are responsible and those who have devised the advances that allow those people to survive.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="090609154000012"></a>For hospital treatment, we rely almost exclusively on National Health Service facilities. Serious casualties need, and receive, advanced levels of care across a wide range of medical disciplines that can found only in a major trauma hospital. In addition, by working in the National Health Service alongside civilian colleagues, our medical staff gain the broadest and most up-to-date training and experience, which helps to save lives on military operations.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="090609154000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patten, and other noble Lords mentioned mental health care, which is extremely important. We provide comprehensive mental health support to our casualties, including military mental health staff in theatre, at Selly Oak Hospital where most of our seriously wounded are treated, and at military departments of community mental health across the country. Real progress has been made to what, across the board, was a Cinderella service in terms of something that people did not like to talk about. There have been many breakthroughs. Mention was made of Combat Stress. In 2007-08 the MoD paid that society &#163;3.2 million for fees for the care of individual war pensioners, which was a substantial increase and which really helps that organisation to do the work that is necessary. We are making very significant progress in that area.</p>

Would she, or if not her because she is very busy then her officials, welcome further discussions with organisations such as the one I referred to, the Warrior Programme, and others, to discuss not just how more public money might be spent, but how these different organisations might knit their care together and make access to that care easier for those people who need help with mental health problems?</p>

It is important that we work together with the charitable sector on these issues, not least because it has a very good record in this area, a good history and a great deal of confidence from those who are in the services.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="090609154000016"></a>Noble Lords mentioned Headley Court and referred to the visit. It is an important facility and there is nothing quite like it in the National Health Service. It is commonly agreed that there is world-class care for the patients there, providing clinical rehabilitation, training, a centre for rehabilitation and research, and all of it tailored to individual needs. We have to do the best we can. The department recently helped with work that is going on there, and the recent Help for Heroes commitment of &#163;8 million to extend facilities is very welcome. We should pay tribute to the work that has been done. We have to do our best to protect our people when we can, to give them the immediate treatment that they need, and to provide the long-term support that some, though not necessarily all, will need over many years.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="090609154000017"></a>The focus of much of this debate has been on retention and on trying to keep people in the military family, if that is what they wish. It is always our intention to retain injured service personnel if it is possible to find worthwhile service employment for them. Each service considers each case individually and works very closely with the medical authorities, taking account of the wishes of the individual service person. This ensures that our personnel are returned to work even if their injury, sickness or disability prevents them undertaking a full range of activities. We want to do this as soon as is reasonable, but clearly we have to do it in such a way that we avoid any employment which would make their underlying medical condition worse.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="090609154000018"></a>In the case of the Army, applications to retain or discharge injured army personnel are currently made by commanding officers on a case-by-case basis and on the recommendation of a full medical board to the Army Personnel Centre. Commanding officers are given advice on this and are currently employing injured personnel wherever possible within units, subject to the individual&#146;s wish to remain and having a worthwhile role. Where the wish is not to remain within their current unit, individuals may elect to leave the Army or, provided that they are above the minimum medical standard, transfer to an alternative cap badge&#151;for example, from the Infantry to the Advocate General&#146;s Corps&#151;and, again, this process would be facilitated by the Army Personnel Centre, which is developing and has expertise in this area.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="090609154000019"></a>The Royal Air Force follows a similar procedure called the medical boarding process. Where an individual&#146;s permanent medical standard is below that required for their current trade, they may be considered for employment within a different trade, obviously with retraining and reskilling being available where that is necessary.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="090609154000020"></a>In the case of the Royal Navy, the majority of personnel with more severe injuries&#151;specifically those injuries sustained while on active service&#151;are young  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_606"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 606</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Royal Marines. These young men have led full, active lives and may or may not find the administrative or clerical sectors as fulfilling, meaningful and appealing as their originally chosen career as a marine in a commando unit. Where the Royal Navy is able to make such opportunities available, an individual can choose to remain in service; or they may choose to make a new start in civilian life, and in that case the appropriate help with transition will be available.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="090609154000021"></a>The real balance that has to be struck is between the wishes of the individual and how far you can accommodate their levels of injury, health problems and abilities because they may need to do different tasks and will need reskilling.</p>

<a name="90609-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="090609154000022"></a>We have made significant progress. We have outstanding care and outstanding welfare care. It is important that we recognise that that is necessary&#151;it can be an emotive area&#151;and, as I mentioned, we work with some of the charities that have a great deal of experience in this area. We appoint visiting officers to provide information and practical support for families, and specialist welfare workers are appointed to co-ordinate the very often numerous agencies that are involved. There cannot be one package. The noble Lord, Lord Lee, asked whether information was available. Because every situation is different, we have to respond to the specific needs of each individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="090609154000023"></a>Other points have been raised but there is not time to answer them all. So far as numbers are concerned, the ones that I have are the total of those who have been very seriously and seriously injured in Iraq, which is 222, and in Afghanistan the total figure is 197. That gives some idea of the scale of the problem and the learning curve that has gone on in the recent past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="090609154000024"></a>We give outstanding medical treatment and we regard these people as individuals and try to meet their individual needs. That is important. Everyone has said that we need to ensure that these people are kept within the military family if that is at all possible. That is something we understand and have tried to work for. Provided we can find a worthwhile role for these people, and provided they as individuals want to stay within the Armed Forces, that is what we try to do. As everyone has said, our Armed Forces are the best in the world. Their dedication and sacrifice are unquestioned and it is only right that the care and support they receive should be equal to that. We are committed to ensuring that that is the case.</p>

When people are very severely injured, sometimes it is several years before they can be brought back into full employment in any new capacity. There is therefore the medical dimension, including the mental dimension, there can be welfare and family issues, but certainly reskilling and retraining is something that is well looked after and provisions are made wherever possible.</p>

<a name="090609157000001"></a><b><a name="90609-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090609157000035"></a>Lord Alton of Liverpool:</b> We come now to Clause 5 and my Amendment 7, which is grouped with other amendments. The amendment would replace the words,</p>
<ul><a name="090609157000025"></a>&#147;how, when and where the deceased came by his or her death&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609157000018"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to bring Clause 5, and with it the statutory framework of the coroners system, into line with the recent jurisprudence of the Judicial Committee of your Lordships&#146; House. Under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, on the right to life, Governments are required to,</p>
<ul><a name="090609157000026"></a>&#147;establish a framework of laws, precautions, procedures and means of enforcement which will, to the greatest extent reasonably practicable, protect life&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609157000019"></a>The European Court of Human Rights has interpreted this as mandating independent official investigation of any death where public servants may be implicated.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="090609157000002"></a>In the landmark House of Lords case of R v Her Majesty&#146;s Coroner for West Somerset ex parte Middleton, their Lordships ruled on 11 March 2004 that in cases where Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights is engaged, the outcome of the inquest as currently provided for in the England and Wales coroners rules by the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="090609157000027"></a>&#147;how the deceased came by his death&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="090609157000020"></a>should be interpreted as,</p>
<ul><a name="090609157000028"></a>&#147;in the broader sense previously rejected, namely as meaning not simply &#145;by what means&#146; but by what means and in what circumstances&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90609-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="090609157000003"></a>Those are the words that I tabled and that appear in the Marshalled List. Their Lordships were essentially seeking to imply a clearer, wider and more robust requirement upon the coroner&#146;s investigation into a contentious or complex death to look at the circumstances around the death in addition to its factual cause. This amendment takes verbatim the very words contained in that judgment&#151;&#147;what means and what circumstances&#148;&#151;and places them into a statutory requirement upon the coroner.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="090609157000004"></a>Like Amendment 2, which I moved earlier, this amendment arises from a proposal put forward by Dame Janet Smith following her own experiences with the Shipman inquiry, which she chaired. It rests on Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, which imposes the duty I have mentioned to undertake a full investigation  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_608"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 608</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the cause of death. In the case of Middleton, to which I referred, our courts have spelt out when Article 2 needs to be engaged and the way in which words such as &#147;how&#148; are to be construed. In meeting that requirement I have used the old rubric,</p>
<ul><a name="090609157000029"></a>&#147;by what means and in what circumstances&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609157000021"></a>Those are the words that my amendment seeks to incorporate in the interests of clarity.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="090609157000005"></a>There are a couple of instances where the absence of this rubric might militate against the interests of the victim or their family. For example, a road traffic accident might initially appear straightforward, but what if the accident occurred because of negligence in maintaining the motorway or some other corporate failing? Detailing the circumstances in which a death occurred is manifestly important. What if a seemingly natural death in a hospital were in reality caused by dismal hygiene or neglect by the NHS? I cite the specific example of Stafford Hospital, which was highlighted in March. I quote from a BBC report entitled &#147;Failing hospital &#145;caused deaths&#146;&#148;. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_96"></a><a name="090609157000024"></a>&#147;A hospital&#146;s &#145;appalling&#146; emergency care resulted in patients dying needlessly, the NHS watchdog has said. About 400 more people died at Stafford Hospital between 2005 and 2008 than would be expected, the Healthcare Commission said. It said there were deficiencies at &#145;virtually every stage&#146; of emergency care and managers pursued targets to the detriment of patient care&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609157000022"></a>The then Secretary of State, Alan Johnson,</p>
<ul><a name="090609157000030"></a>&#147;said a review of Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, would be carried out, focusing on the years 2002 to 2007&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609157000006"></a>I deliberately mention the long period of time that the Secretary of State&#146;s review is covering because clearly these were not instances that were picked up in coroners&#146; investigations carried out during that time, as I think we would all agree they should have been. I agree with Mr Johnson when he says,</p>
<ul><a name="090609157000031"></a>&#147;there was a complete failure of management to address serious problems and monitor performance. This led to a totally unacceptable failure to treat emergency patients safely and with dignity&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90609-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="090609157000007"></a>Such failings will undoubtedly occur again. It is in the nature of the way that we run our hospitals and our public services that awful serial mistakes can sometimes be made with tragic consequences for all those involved. Part of what the Shipman inquiry tried to identify in the case of a doctor who had been taking the lives of his patients was that where a pattern emerges, it should be identified at a very early point. By not having in the Bill these words, which appear in the European Convention on Human Rights, we are perhaps failing to recognise a gap that needs to be plugged. That is why it would be good to incorporate these words in the Bill which Dame Janet Smith, who carried out the inquiry, believes to be necessary.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="090609157000008"></a>I hope that the Minister, who has sat patiently throughout our proceedings and listened to this speech, will think carefully about this and even if he cannot accept the terms of the amendment today, perhaps he will give it further thought between now and Report.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_609"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 609</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90609-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="090609157000010"></a>The term &#147;how&#148; appears to be too simplistic for all the reasons outlined by my noble friend Lord Alton. I want to link this to coding, however; when a death has occurred, the narrative verdict goes to the Office for National Statistics, where coding has to be undertaken. I should like to give a shortened example to illustrate why &#147;how&#148; is too simplistic.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="090609157000011"></a>Let me give the example of a drowning. A deceased person who resigned from work appeared to become depressed and did not want to bother his GP. He felt guilty towards others at work that he had not been replaced. His partner came home to find an empty house. Thinking that he had gone for a walk along the cliffs, which was near their home, his partner went to search for him but the body was found in the water. The emergency services were called, the body was retrieved from the water by the coastguard, and the post-mortem revealed drowning. That is a shortened version. The problem facing the ONS in coding was whether this was an accidental or unintentional death, intentional self-harm, assault or an event whose intent cannot be determined.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="090609157000012"></a>We look at statistics to see what is happening in our society, particularly in the case of self-harm&#151;we have talked a lot about suicides already&#151;but without the accurate coding of a death we do not know. There is a problem when there is only a narrative verdict, but there is also a problem sometimes if there is not a narrative verdict because it does not set the context of the death. That was the thinking behind Amendment 27, which aims to make sure that whoever is involved in the hearing will put some thought into which category they felt would be most appropriate for the death to be classified as well as providing a narrative verdict.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="090609157000013"></a>There are other examples that I could give, but because of the time I will not go into them. I have a whole collection, however, and it is to the credit of the Office for National Statistics that it manages to provide coding on some of the very complex verdicts that emerge.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="090609157000014"></a>There is another problem about how a death occurred. As well as the means by which the death occurred, there can be important cases involving public health and safety, where the Human Rights Act does not apply and there is need for a broader inquiry, such as deaths raising concern about transport or workplace safety; the death of a vulnerable old person in a nursing home; or the death of someone in a private workplace. There needs to be a lot more said than simply &#147;how&#148; their death came about.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="090609157000015"></a>On Amendment 26, the Bill appears to prevent verdicts of unlawful killing or neglect which appear to determine civil liability. As I understand it, there is a debate in the courts at present about whether an inquest can contain judgmental words such as &#147;serious&#148; or &#147;unreasonable&#148;. It seems that this dates back to 1984. Since then, however, processes of judicial review, regulatory law and professional accountability have increasingly been developed. I am grateful to Inquest for drawing to my attention the inconsistency between this legislation and the legislation in Scotland where, if there is a fatal accident inquiry, deaths are investigated and the sheriff is allowed to determine, among other  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_610"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 610</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>things: where and when the death and any accident resulting in the death took place; the cause or causes of the death and any such accident; the reasonable precautions, if any, whereby the death and any accident resulting in the death might have been avoided; the defects, if any, in any system of working which contributed to the death, or any accident resulting in the death, and any other facts which are relevant to the circumstances of the death.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="090609157000016"></a>I understand from Inquest that it has long argued that the prohibition on verdicts appearing to determine an issue should be removed from coronial law altogether. The issue in an inquest is responsibility, not liability. There can be confusion, which is why these amendments have been put down. Indeed, I began to wonder, in the light of the recent judgment in Northern Ireland, whether this part of the legislation would now require a small amount of amending. I would leave that up to the Minister and the Bill team and not attempt to do that myself.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="090609157000017"></a>Amendment 29 links to this and is quite specific about whether precautions were taken to prevent or avoid the death; and that is linked again to the safety aspects and whether proceedings or questions should be raised immediately following the inquest to protect others who might be in a high-risk environment but are unaware of it. That relates particularly to employers. I hope that that explains, as briefly as I can, the thinking behind this group of amendments and why the word &#147;how&#148; seems grossly inadequate and really should be expanded on.</p>

<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="0906107000001"></a><b><a name="90609-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0906107000042"></a>Lord Alderdice:</b> I will speak to a number of amendments in this group in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford and in the names of other noble Lords. There are two elements to the consideration of Clause 5. The first is what people&#151;particularly the bereaved and the family affected&#151;generally expect of a coroner and a coroners&#146; court. They expect that, in an experienced, thoughtful and wise non-adversarial investigation, someone with judicial qualities will be able to get to the bottom of what happened and explain that to them. Many of these issues are complex and highly unlikely to be fully described or properly conveyed with a narrow, diagnostic mandate. The second consideration is that we have been faced, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has pointed out, with decisions of your Lordships&#146; House in a judicial capacity that show that the human rights convention requires us to go much further than would have been the case in the past.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="0906107000002"></a>Those are two important components. What is somewhat disappointing about this clause is that it appears to be saying that, although we have to accommodate the human rights convention, we will do so as narrowly as we possibly can, rather than opening it up and giving as wide as possible opportunities for the coroner to explore things and to describe them for the benefit of the family and the community and of wider knowledge.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="0906107000003"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, have begun to try to open up the thinking and the possibilities that might be available to the coroner. In these amendments, we have tried to  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_611"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 611</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>add to conformity with the human rights convention the interests of justice. We should be doing things not just because we are being forced into it&#151;because we have signed up to the convention&#151;but because it is the right thing to do and opens things up in the interests of justice.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="0906107000004"></a>What things could reasonably be considered? We have tried to enumerate a few, but the list is not exhaustive. For example, to what extent were systemic failings a factor in the death, or what appropriate precautions could have been taken? If a person takes their life, was the risk of their doing so not recognised, whether whole or in part, by people who were acting on behalf of the state? There are other factors of this kind, but I often find it useful in these circumstances to give an example. Here, I declare an interest as a consultant psychiatrist working in the National Health Service.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="0906107000005"></a>I shall go back to a fairly early experience of my own. A man was in hospital in an extremely distressed, depressed and psychotic state. He believed that he was responsible for all sorts of terrible things that had been happening. There had been a disco disaster in another country, with a terrible fire and a lot of people killed. He believed that his thoughts had contributed to this terrible business. He was not very forthcoming to the staff in general, but, as a young doctor, I spent some time with him and he was prepared to talk a bit more to me. I realised that this man was very disturbed and very likely to kill himself.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="0906107000006"></a>I explained the situation to my consultant boss. He said, &#147;Well, I think we need to make sure that nobody allows this man out of the ward. This is very dangerous; he&#146;s going to harm himself&#148;. Rather foolishly, 100 years or so previously, those who had designed the hospital had put it not very far from a railway line, so we knew that there was a serious risk to this man. When the man said to one of the nursing staff, who was a very kind person, &#147;Look, I&#146;m very anxious; I&#146;m in a terrible state and I just want to go over to the hospital shop to buy myself some cigarettes to help myself calm down&#148;, the nurse felt that it was not a wholly unreasonable demand. But the man never returned to the ward. He went straight down to the railway line and threw himself on top of the next train.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="0906107000007"></a>To describe that simply as a man who was an in-patient in a hospital and committed suicide is not very helpful. It does not tell us what happened; it does not tell us what could have made sure that it did not happen; it does not tell us whether systemic failings or professional failings were to blame. We should know not because we are out to attribute blame and liability but because, if we understand what actually happened, that often helps the family and it could help hospital staff and others to deal more appropriately with things.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="0906107000008"></a>Unfortunately, Clause 5(3) gives a fairly robust indication that nobody should say anything except the least that they can say&#151;the coroner and the jury if one is involved should be very careful about what they say&#151;whereas in many ways we should try to encourage people to be as openly thoughtful as they can be. There are of course reasonable and proper, as well as professional, limits to what people should say and do.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_612"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 612</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90609-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="0906107000009"></a>The amendment suggests that, rather than simply saying that the human rights convention has forced us down a particular road, we should embrace it and ask whether we can open up our verdicts to be more narrative and explanatory in their design and approach, taking some responsibility to point up any of the systemic or other failures or problems that have arisen during an appropriate investigation. This is not an adversarial but an investigatory system of judgment, which can bring help and comfort to families and enable them to understand more of what has happened, as well as helping the system to develop and improve by learning from sometimes painful experience.</p>

I welcome the fact that the Government are seeking to have these measures compliant with the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights. Amendment 11 would allow a coroner to ascertain the circumstances of a death in cases where there could be a risk to public health and safety or where the coroner believed that it was in the public interest. There may be cases not necessarily subject to the application of the Human Rights Act or the protection of the convention where it would surely be appropriate for an investigation into the relevant circumstances of the death to take place. I might perhaps best illustrate this by giving a number of examples.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="0906107000011"></a>There might, for instance, be a death of a vulnerable person in a private care home. There might be a death in a private workplace. There might be a death involving British state agents in circumstances where the Human Rights Act does not apply because the date of death was before the Human Rights Act came into force, or because the location of death was abroad and outside the limited extraterritorial scope of the European Convention on Human Rights. It might be the death of a British national abroad, not involving British state agents but in circumstances where there was no prospect of adequate investigation by the host state. There might be deaths involving other circumstances that, if allowed to continue or recur, may result in the deaths of other members of the public. That is surely one of the key issues. If there is a problem that can be established, and doing so may save other people&#146;s lives, I argue that it is appropriate that the Bill should cover that circumstance and give the coroner the power to investigate. That is the purpose of Amendment 11.</p>

<a name="90609-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="0906107000012"></a>On Amendment 28, the problem is that there seems to be a possible conflict between two parts of the Bill. These are the general duty on coroners outlined in Clause 5 and what is said in Clause 10, particularly subsection (2), to the effect that a determination from a coroner may not be worded in a way that appears to declare a person guilty of a criminal offence or to determine a civil liability. On the face of it, that may not seem improper, but a coroner might interpret it as a constraint on the more general investigation of a death. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that this constraint will not be a limiting factor on how the coroner approaches his responsibilities. The dilemma is a simple one. I hope that Amendment 28 is a way around that dilemma, in enabling the coroner to

It is a worthwhile amendment and I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic in his approach to it.</p>

On the question of civil liability, it should be realised that, in practice, when dealing with an accident case, the very first thing that a solicitor or counsel will look for is the inquest transcript and findings. If certain facts emerge in the course of the inquest, or if certain witnesses give evidence and the coroner comes to a particular view, it is very powerful material that will encourage an insurance company to settle the case so that no litigation follows. Of course, if there is litigation, the fact that the inquest has come to a particular view is, in civil cases, of no consequence. The court will decide on the evidence that is produced before it. However, the inquest is the starting point for the solicitor in looking at how to approach an insurance company to settle a claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="0906107000014"></a>In the case of criminal liability, the old rule used to be that a coroner&#146;s jury could commit a defendant or named person to the assizes. I recall having just such a case as a young solicitor. A baby had died at the age of six or 10 weeks and there was a great deal of controversy over how that death had occurred. The coroner&#146;s jury committed the case to the assizes, but the practice was that the Director of Public Prosecutions would then hold ordinary committal proceedings in a magistrates&#146; court. I appeared as a solicitor for the father of the baby in the magistrates&#146; court and secured his acquittal at that point. When I was about 23 or 24, I regarded that as a great victory, but 15 years later I was told by the paediatrician whom I had cross-examined that my client had killed his second child and then confessed to having killed his first child. That has coloured my view of acquittals ever since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="0906107000015"></a>However, that is not the system that operates at the moment. Clearly, no coroner&#146;s verdict, or a jury&#146;s verdict, can determine either criminal or civil liability. However, it has its place in determining whether civil liability can be established to the satisfaction of an insurance company that will settle the claim. For that reason I support the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and consider that the Bill as drafted is far too narrowly confined as regards the purpose and significance of a jury&#146;s verdict.</p>

<a name="0906107000016"></a><b><a name="90609-0014.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0906107000045"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in this very important debate. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, criticises the narrowness of this part of the Bill. Why are the matters to be ascertained so narrowly? I suggest that it is because the nature of coroners&#146; investigations is different from other forms of legal proceeding. The purpose is to establish facts; it is not to apportion blame or establish legal liability. That is an important principle. Of course, modern law has altered. The European Convention on Human Rights has had an effect and I shall say something about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="0906107000017"></a>Clause 5 needs to be read in conjunction with Clause 10&#151;that was referred to by my noble friend Lord Dubs&#151;and paragraph 6 of Schedule 4. Clause 5  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_614"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 614</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>merely outlines what the legal purpose of the investigation is, and the information that such an investigation has to ascertain. Clause 10 clarifies that any determination or findings are framed in a way that does not determine any question of criminal or civil liability because that is not the function of an inquest; that is the function of a criminal or civil trial. Coroners retain the ability to give a narrative verdict. Paragraph 6 of Schedule 4 gives the coroner the power to make a report on actions to be taken to prevent other deaths. These powers combined give a very wide ambit for coroners to make whatever comments they deem necessary.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="0906107000018"></a>It seems to us that Amendment 7 in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, seeks to extend the remit of the matters to be ascertained as part of a coroner&#146;s investigation to an unnecessary extent. We fear it would mean that all cases are investigated to an extent that ascertains not only the immediate factual details of the case&#151;in other words, the identity of the deceased person concerned and how, when and where they died&#151;but the broader circumstances leading up to and surrounding the death.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="0906107000019"></a>As the law stands, and in the Bill as drafted, such an extensive investigation is required only in cases where Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights is engaged. As the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, gave his helpful, graphic example, I thought that that case seemed to me to be, prima facie at least, an Article 2 case. Such an approach would lead to a significant drain on resources and to delays in holding inquests and in most cases add little to the totality of knowledge about a death. I stress that coroners already have, and under the Bill will continue to have, the ability to conduct a wider investigation into any deaths that they have a duty to investigate.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="0906107000020"></a>Clause 5(2) merely reinforces the fact that in cases where Article 2 is engaged, coroners must&#151;I emphasise &#147;must&#148;&#151;ascertain the wider circumstances leading up to and surrounding the death as part of the investigation. In cases where Article 2 is not engaged&#151;and there are many of them&#151;coroners may still examine the wider circumstances leading up to and surrounding the death if they consider it appropriate to do so.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="0906107000021"></a>With regard to looking at the wider circumstances of any death caused by suicide, I understand fully the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, at Second Reading that there may need to be some distinction between the means of death&#151;that is, by what method the deceased person concerned killed themselves&#151;and the circumstances in which they came by their death&#151;that is, what triggered within them the desire to take their own life. However, our view is that this issue can more properly be addressed by guidance from the Chief Coroner specially tailored to those deaths rather than placing a blanket requirement in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="0906107000022"></a>Turning to Amendments 8 and 11, I agree that deaths may occur in certain circumstances where Article 2 rights are not engaged and where therefore the requirement to hold a wider-ranging investigation under Clause 5(2) does not arise but where there would nevertheless be benefit in the broader circumstances of the death being investigated&#151;the type of case to which my noble friend Lord Dubs referred. This may be for the  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_615"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 615</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reasons stated in the amendments before us today or for other reasons. I repeat that the discretion to carry out a wider-ranging investigation already exists and will continue to exist under the reformed coroner regime. The coroner has the discretion to set the scope of an inquest and may decide to investigate the broad circumstances that caused or contributed to any death, even if Article 2 is not formally engaged.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="0906107000023"></a>Given that broad discretion&#151;and I should add that this is a matter on which the new Chief Coroner may decide to issue guidance&#151;we do not believe that it is necessary to list in the Bill the circumstances contained in the amendments. In addition, the Bill was strengthened in the other place in respect of following up recommendations to prevent future deaths. That is why Schedule 4 and Clause 29 provide for the Chief Coroner to receive all reports from senior coroners on the matter of preventing deaths, together with the responses of the recipients of those reports, and for the Chief Coroner to then summarise them every year in his or her annual report to the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="0906107000024"></a>I move on to Amendments 9, 10 and 29. We are concerned that these amendments would take the coroner system back to the days to which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred, when coroners had a role in the detection of crime and would routinely attribute blame and assign civil or criminal liability. During the previous century, coroners&#146; duties in these respects were gradually reduced. For example, the Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926&#151;I do not suggest that the matters that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was talking about occurred prior to 1926&#151;introduced the requirement for the adjournment of an inquest until the completion of indictable criminal proceedings. Concern over coroners&#146; possible encroachment into areas of criminal justice were renewed in 1975, as some of us will remember well, when a coroner&#146;s jury named the missing Lord Lucan&#151;my officials asked whether I should refer to him as the noble Lord, Lord Lucan&#151;as guilty of the murder of his children&#146;s nanny. This anachronism was removed by the Criminal Law Act 1977, which excluded the question of criminal liability from the purposes of the inquest.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="0906107000025"></a>The matters listed in the amendments that I refer to are, in our view, matters that are far more suited to coroners&#146; reports to prevent future deaths. A coroner could, quite properly and legitimately, give his or her view on such matters in any report to prevent future deaths. The Government place great store on these reports that are currently made under rule 43 of the existing Coroners Rules 1984, and will in future, as I have said, be made under paragraph 6 of Schedule 4 to this Bill.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="0906107000026"></a>Similarly, Amendment 12, which seeks to remove subsection (3) of Clause 5, would remove the obligation not to express an opinion with respect to the matters to be ascertained under Clause 5(1) and (2). This obligation is there because the matters to be ascertained under these clauses are matters of fact. There should not be room for additional opinion in determining these matters. I shall point out that subsection (3) of Clause 5 contains the proviso that it is subject to paragraph 4 of Schedule 6, which I have just referred  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_616"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 616</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to. There will also be scope, within the underpinning rules, for narrative verdicts, which coroners and juries, when directed to do so, make use of when it seems a more appropriate format than a so-called short-form verdict&#151;such as &#147;death by misadventure&#148; or &#147;death by suicide&#148;&#151;in order to reflect the circumstances of the death. Those provisions give enough scope for coroners and juries to make known matters that they believe ought to be made known. As I understand it, they do not have to relate to Article 2 cases.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="0906107000027"></a>I turn to Amendments 26 and 28. I want to assure my noble friend Lord Dubs and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that Clause 10(2) is not intended to prevent a coroner or jury considering facts bearing on civil or criminal liability in order to reach a determination. A determination pointing to responsibility for a death will not offend subsection (2) of Clause 10, provided that it is framed in such a way so as not to appear to determine any question of criminal liability on the part of a named person or any question of civil liability. Again, I do not believe it is necessary to state this on the face of the legislation.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="0906107000028"></a>We would be particularly concerned by any changes to the law that allowed the determinations and statements made by coroners or juries to be framed in a manner that could lead to comments on matters of criminal and legal liability, as Amendment 26 would appear to ask to allow. We have doubts that simply stating on the face of the Bill that any determinations made under Clause 10(1)(a) should not be construed in that way, as Amendment 26 suggests, would be sufficient to prevent this from actually happening. Coronial determinations or findings that can be construed as apportioning blame could well have an influence on later proceedings when matters of civil or criminal liability are being dealt with in the courts. We want to avoid the situation in particular where a possible murder or manslaughter trial is prejudiced because the jury are aware of determinations and findings made at an inquest that appear to have already indicated a person&#146;s guilt.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="0906107000029"></a>I turn finally, but not at all least, to Amendment 27, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, which would require every coroner verdict to use an,</p>
<ul><a name="0906107000040"></a>&#147;internationally agreed code for the cause of death&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0906107000039"></a>and include a narrative description. As we understand it, the first part of her amendment would, in practice, mean classifying each cause of death into a category recognised by the World Health Organisation. I accept that, on the face of it, that amendment may make it easier to compile statistics on the causes of death, so that deaths can be centrally collated to reveal trends and clusters. That is her case, I think. We fear that, in practice, it could mean that coroners would feel compelled to apply a classification that did not accurately reflect how someone died. Why is this? This is because not every death investigated by a coroner will be caused by a disease or health problem listed in the International Classification of Diseases. Having said that, we recognise the importance of statistics to inform future public policy but we believe that coroners need discretion in order to give a verdict that reflects the particulars of the individual case. The amendment would also require a narrative verdict in every inquest. We do not consider  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_617"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 617</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such a requirement to be necessary or appropriate. Coroners are already aware of the option of a narrative verdict, but in most cases short-form verdicts are perfectly adequate to convey the cause of death accurately to the satisfaction of all parties and interested persons.</p>

<a name="90609-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="0906107000030"></a>It has been a fascinating debate, and I feel that we may return to this later in our discussions, but I have tried to explain to the Committee tonight why we are not immediately attracted to the amendments.</p>

Let us suppose for a moment that a young soldier has been killed as a result of being sent on patrol in a Land Rover that is not adequately protected against landmines. Let us suppose that that fact emerges in the course of an inquest. Do the provisions of the Bill prevent the coroner or a jury from making that absolutely clear in the verdict or decision that they make as a result of the inquest? That is the problem. It may very well inhibit a jury or a coroner to be told: &#147;You cannot determine civil liability in this case&#148;, when they are faced with the clearest evidence that inadequate provision has been made for the safety of the young soldier.</p>

We could, perhaps, seek in guidance that best practice by the coroner would, wherever possible, give a steer to the Office for National Statistics over which coding might be appropriate, without necessarily making that the definitive coding.

When the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, said that the present wording in the Bill is a narrow interpretation of the convention and that there is an opportunity here to be rather more generous in how we set out the legislation, he got the point right. He was also right to remind us that the purpose of any coroner&#146;s inquiry is to get to the bottom of what occurred. He said that we had to do this in the interests of justice and to expose systemic failings. I strongly agree with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09061011000012"></a>One of the problems is that our failure to interpret a duty that has been imposed on us not just by the convention but also by jurisprudence in our country&#151;I referred to the Middleton case earlier&#151;may lead to some practical consequences.

How could we know retrospectively whether it would have been right to invoke Article 2 at, for instance, the beginning of the proceedings and what would that do to the proceedings themselves if this was only belatedly referred to as they went on? That is a recipe for confusion and would prevent us bringing about the kind of justice we want to see and the rooting out of systemic failure that I referred to in my opening remarks and which was referred to by other noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="09061011000060"></a>At the moment the amendment states &#147;an&#148; inquest. The amendment simply seeks to make sure that decisions become consistent across the whole of the country. If a coroner is holding far fewer inquests into a certain type of death than another, that would be revealed. The amendment would ensure consistency of standards right across the country as the Chief Coroner would have access to a register that collates and compares different coronial areas. That is all I want to say in explanation of that amendment, because at the moment, although such a record might be held somewhere locally, there is no way that the person who will become the Chief Coroner will be able to access that. As far as I understand, it would need to be held in a consistent format.</p>

My noble friend referred to these issues a few moments ago. This amendment places in the Bill a requirement to record discontinued investigations. I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that coroners do keep this information. It is recorded in the annual statistics about the operation of the system, which are published by the Lord Chancellor. The most recent publication was submitted on 7 May. For example, in 2008 approximately 235,000 deaths were referred to the coroner. There were around 31,000 inquests. This shows, if I do my sums right, that the vast majority of investigations&#151;204,000&#151;did not proceed to an inquest.</p>

I take some comfort from the fact that, while there has not yet been a meeting of minds on the solution, there is a general recognition that, under the law as it currently stands, there is a real practical problem. There will be very rare cases where a coroner is obliged to summon a jury, but where there is sensitive material which is relevant to ascertaining the circumstances of the death but which cannot be disclosed publicly, including to the members of a coroner&#146;s jury or to the family of the deceased. If the sensitive matters are central to the determination of the issues it may therefore be impossible for an Article 2-compliant inquest to proceed. This includes those cases where the material concerned is intercept material, the use of which in legal proceedings of any kind is strictly limited, as the Committee knows, by the provisions of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09061011000023"></a>That, in a nutshell, is the problem that the Government have tried to address and which Clauses 11 and 12 were intended to deal with. However, the problem remains with us, with or without Clauses 11 and 12. Existing safeguards such as public interest immunity certificates, anonymity for witnesses, heavily redacted and other material may be appropriate for some inquests,  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_622"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 622</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such as the inquest into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes, but there will continue to be very rare and exceptional cases where even these measures will not be sufficient to enable an inquest which must be held with a jury to satisfy the requirements of Article 2 while, at the same time, ensuring that protected material is not made public or unlawfully disclosed.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09061011000024"></a>We have acted in good faith in seeking to find an acceptable and workable solution within the framework of both the current coroner system and our reform model. We responded positively with further amendments of our own when concerns were expressed about these provisions, both in the other place and by those outside Parliament who share everyone&#146;s commitment to ensuring that families get the fullest answers to questions they have about the death of a loved one. However, it is clear that none of these amendments has commanded the level of confidence and cross-party support that we wished for.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09061011000025"></a>In the light of this we need to find an alternative way forward. In future, for those rare investigations into deaths when an Article 2-compliant inquest cannot take place because the inquest must be held with a jury and there is sensitive material which is central to the investigation but cannot be publicly disclosed, the Government will consider establishing an inquiry held under the Inquiries Act 2005. So the death will be investigated in that way rather than by way of a coroner&#146;s inquest.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09061011000026"></a>The Committee will be anxious to know what the terms of reference of such an inquiry would be. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, spoke on this in the Second Reading debate. As those who have read the provisions of the Inquiries Act will know better than I, this is a matter to be agreed between the Secretary of State establishing the inquiry and the chairman appointed to lead it. However, when an inquiry is held instead of an inquest, the terms of reference are almost certain to include the matters to be ascertained by a coroner set out in Clause 5, which we have just debated.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09061011000027"></a>Inquiries are not a lesser form of inquest and a death will be investigated just as thoroughly at an inquiry as at an inquest. Most campaigners would regard the kind of detail it can delve into as being at the very top end of an investigation into a death, an event or a series of events. It is not unusual for inquiries to be sought after an inquest has been held in order that further and wider matters can be considered. This proposal is not a second best for families but a genuine alternative.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09061011000028"></a>It is in that context that I move Amendment 14, which is consequential on the eventual removal of Clauses 11 and 12. It is appropriate that I should stop there and allow the other amendments in the group to be spoken to, and then come back and try to answer some of the points that are raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09061011000030"></a>There was a great deal of unhappiness at the idea of secret inquests, so we are very pleased that the Government have withdrawn that idea, at least. I am not going to address the RIPA provisions right now, because I have Amendment 30 to deal specifically with those more technical issues later, but it is impossible to address this issue without referring to RIPA. As the Minister said, every time we come to address this issue, we seem to be dealing with the one case&#151;the unfinished inquest of Azelle Rodney&#151;because this RIPA evidence is so sensitive. However, when we considered the anti-terrorism Bill, we were talking about two cases, because there was a second case, that of Terry Nicholas. In the intervening time, the Terry Nicholas case has, interestingly, been settled entirely by a coroner, redacting much of the evidence, with no problem at all. She made a series of judgments that enabled the inquest to go forward, be heard and be resolved. What the Government felt at that time was insoluble has since been solved, so we are looking at putting on to the statute book a whole different method of holding inquests simply to solve one case. I wonder whether that is a good way to do legislation.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09061011000031"></a>I see the downsides of an inquiry and I am not at all resolved that the Government have got the right solution to the problem. An inquiry, under the Inquiries Act, does not really fulfil any of the requirements that we are looking for with an open inquest. To begin with, the Secretary of State controls the appointment and the remit of the panel. There is also the big question as to whether it will cover the same ground as the statutory requirements of an inquest. As we discussed earlier in relation to the circumstances, it would be for the Minister to define all that. Therefore, whereas the coroner would control an inquest, it is likely that there would be strong ministerial control, as the Inquiries Act is drafted. There would be no jury asking questions, deciding facts and meeting public concerns. There would be private sittings, which would tend to be much less open and accessible to the public&#151;obviously, because they are private. There is none of the purported scrutiny of the decision to keep evidence secret that the judicial review provisions would have provided for and there may not be sufficient funding made available to the parties to challenge any of this.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09061011000032"></a>The only possible advantage is that, following the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 amendments to RIPA, at least such inquiries can now receive RIPA material. That obviously gets around the issue of this one inquest that cannot be held at the moment and, in fairness to the family, they would very much welcome a resolution to the fact that their inquest cannot be heard. However, I think that, to resolve that one issue, we are in danger of putting on to the statute book a system of holding inquests that runs completely counter to the tone of all the discussion and debate that we have had this evening about having as full disclosure and discovery as possible, not only in the interests of the family, but in the wider interests of society. When we debated the Counter-Terrorism Bill, we cast our minds back to the &#147;Death on the Rock&#148; shootings&#151;I expect that that would now be held as an inquiry and very little would come out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09061011000033"></a>I am deeply unhappy at the Government&#146;s suggestion that anything held under the Inquiries Act 2005 would substitute for an inquest. I understand why the Government have put this forward, because they are in a very difficult position with the Azelle Rodney case, but I hope that all Members of this Committee will view this proposition with a good degree of scepticism and that, during this debate, we might find a different way forward.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09061011000035"></a>I have tabled Amendment 46, which sets out what we require as the minimum amendments necessary to the Inquiries Act to make it a viable vehicle for the purpose that the Government appear at the moment to intend. I am uneasy about using the Inquiries Act for this purpose because its procedures are initiated by an executive act by the Secretary of State, and the investigation flows from that act. By contrast, coroners are centuries-old, well established public figures who are independent of the Executive; and, as a matter of principle, one would wish that all inquests were conducted through the coronial system.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09061011000036"></a>If the Inquiries Act is to play some role in future, however, then in my submission at least four amendments to it are needed, to Sections 3, 5, 13 and 19. The amendment to Section 3, in our submission, requires that where an inquiry is to be used as an inquest, it will always be chaired by either a High Court judge or a more senior judge.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09061011000037"></a>Section 5 permits the Minister, believe it or not, to change the terms of reference of an inquiry in the course of the inquiry. I remember that, at the time when the Inquiries Act was before your Lordships&#146; House in the form of a Bill, that power was much fought over. Surely, whatever value it might give to some inquiries in future, it cannot possibly have a role in an inquiry that, in effect, is performing a coronial function. It would be outrageous if the Secretary of State attempted, in the course of an inquiry looking into the death of someone under Clause 5 of the Bill, to seek to change the terms of reference of that inquiry.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09061011000038"></a>Section 13, which gives the Secretary of State the power to suspend an inquiry at any point, ought to be amended in the case of inquiries investigating deaths that fall into the category of Clause 5 of the Bill. Any attempt to seek to suspend the inquiry should have the consent of the judge who is chairing it.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09061011000039"></a>Section 19 gives wide powers to the Secretary of State to restrict public access to the documentation of the inquiry. We believe that any restrictions placed on such documentation should be placed on it only with the consent of the chairman of the inquiry, the High Court judge or more senior judge.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09061011000040"></a>From our point of view, those would be the minimum changes necessary if the issue of an inquiry under the Inquiries Act should be pursued any further.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09061011000042"></a>Schedule 1(3), the subject of Amendment 33, requires the senior coroner to suspend his investigation if the cause of death is to be &#147;adequately investigated&#148; under the Inquiries Act. That is the Government&#146;s proposed solution. Yet Schedule 1(3) begs the essential question because the Inquiries Act procedure is simply not adequate in this context. It has serious defects, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggested, by reason of the powers that it confers on the Minister to both institute and intervene in the work of the work of the inquiry.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09061011000043"></a>Amendment 46 identifies some of those defects, in particular the power to suspend the inquiry and the power to restrict public access. Would the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and the Minister reflect on further provisions in the Inquiries Act which also need amendment if that Act is to be used in Clause 5 cases? Under Section 14 of the Inquiries Act, the Minister has a power to bring an inquiry to an end at any time he so wishes. Under Section 25, the Minister has power to withhold the publication of any part of the report if he considers it to be in the public interest to do so. Those powers, as well as those in Sections 5, 13 and 19 which Amendment 46 addresses, are quite impossible to reconcile with a judicial procedure which is independent, seen to be independent, and commands public confidence in these sensitive cases.</p>

<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_626"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column 626</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we are doing. On the chairmanship of an inquiry established for these purposes, I assure the Committee that we fully expect to appoint a senior judge, in much the same way that Clause 11 provided for a High Court judge to preside at a certified inquest.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09061011000049"></a>As to the other changes the noble Lord has proposed, we remain to be persuaded that they are necessary. Removing the ability to amend the terms of reference of an inquiry into the circumstances of a person&#146;s death might be detrimental to the interests of the bereaved family given that information could come to light which suggests that the terms of reference should be revised. That said&#151;I repeat what I said when I spoke to my amendment&#151;we would expect the terms of reference for any inquiry to reflect the matters to be ascertained by a coroner set out in Clause 5 and it is unlikely that, once set, they will need to be changed.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09061011000050"></a>As to the powers vested in the responsible Minister to suspend an inquiry and restrict public access&#151;something that has exercised the noble Lord, Lord Pannick&#151;we cannot see why different arrangements should apply in the case of an inquiry examining the circumstances of a person&#146;s death compared with any other inquiry which, by its nature, is also likely to be considering issues of considerable public importance. We believe that the decision whether to restrict public access to safeguard national security or international relations should properly rest with Ministers which is what, as I understand it, occurs at the moment.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09061011000051"></a>We would expect the greater part of any inquiry to be held in public. While legal aid is not available, the chairman of such an inquiry may award an amount in respect of legal representation for interested parties. Decisions made by the chairman of an inquiry&#151;for example, to exclude the public from certain parts of it&#151;are open to judicial review. That is all I want to say on this issue tonight. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, asked whether we will consider what has been said. Of course we will. I want to make it absolutely clear that our position is as it is at present.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09061011000052"></a>Amendments 32 to 36 deal with the relationship between a coroner&#146;s investigation and a public inquiry into the same death. It is entirely appropriate that where an inquiry is established into the circumstances of a death, the coroner&#146;s investigation should be suspended and resumed only if the coroner considers that there are exceptional reasons to do so.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09061011000053"></a>The Bill also provides that an investigation may not be resumed after the completion of an inquiry unless, but must be resumed if, the senior coroner believes there is sufficient reason for resuming it. However, these provisions are intended to cover situations in which the terms of reference of an inquiry will not, or have not, achieved an inquest&#146;s statutory purposes. As I have said, an inquiry held in these circumstances is very likely to have within its terms of reference the coroner&#146;s statutory purposes; accordingly, a coroner would be expected to suspend and not resume his or her investigation in such cases.</p>

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09061011000054"></a>Indeed, if the circumstances of the death had been fully investigated by an inquiry, I would have to question the value of resuming the inquest in such a situation, particularly if the coroner did not have access to

<a name="90609-0015.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09061011000061"></a>I recognise that there is no perfect solution to the issue that Clauses 11 and 12 sought to address, and we accept that the approach set out in these clauses does not command the necessary cross-party support. On that basis, I would ask for support across the Committee for the government amendments. I also invite the Committee to think carefully about whether in the absence of Clauses 11 and 12, it is not right to accept that the only assured way of ensuring that Article 2-compliant investigation can proceed while also protecting highly sensitive material that may be relevant to a determination on the circumstances of a death is to proceed, in those very exceptional cases, by way of an inquiry rather than a coroners&#146; inquest. Indeed, the noble Baroness will forgive me if I do not&#151;I should not&#151;refer to any individual case, outstanding or not.</p>

Who makes the judgment on that &#147;cannot&#148;? On whose say-so is it that there cannot be an inquest? Is it the same person who orders the inquiry and sets the remit? One of the big difficulties is that somebody is deciding that there cannot be an inquest, and pretty much the same person&#151;I presume it is the Home Secretary, who may say that the inquest cannot be held for reasons of national security&#151;will be setting the remit. That does not seem very satisfactory.</p>

I wish to use the opportunities afforded by debating the Bill in Grand Committee to allow your Lordships to have a wide-ranging discussion on the issue.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000004"></a>The Minister has no doubt been briefed by his department that one reason to reject this amendment is because it is, in the favoured term of parliamentary draftsmen, &#147;technically deficient&#148;. He should not worry overly about that. When we return to this part of the Bill on Report, I will likely have tabled slightly altered amendments. That, of course, depends very much on how he replies to my questioning.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000005"></a>The real targets of this exclusionary amendment are Clauses 1 and 2. I seek to exclude single parents with children under school age from requirements to take part in &#147;work for your benefit&#148; schemes and work-related activity. I hope that I may count on a certain amount of support from other noble Lords across the Committee&#151;I know that I have it from outside groups such as Gingerbread, which has been able to provide me with plenty of real-life stories, and Z2K.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000006"></a>My amendment would place a clear ne plus ultra line on the creeping revision of the relevant age of one&#146;s children for welfare purposes. Until last year, it was possible for a single parent to remain on income support until the youngest child reached the age of 16. However, in June 2007, the Government announced that they were moving lone parents from income support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance in stages. That process began last year, when the age limit for single parents to remain on income support was reduced to the youngest child reaching the age of 12. The process of transferring lone parents from income support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance is proceeding apace. The age of children at which lone parents are transferred to jobseeker&#146;s allowance will fall to seven in October 2010. Lone parents with  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>children under the age of seven will not be expected to move from income support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance, as is the case for lone parents of children over the age of seven. However, under the Government&#146;s plans, they will be expected to fulfil the requirements set out in Clause 1.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000007"></a>My understanding from the compendious Peers&#146; information pack, for which I am grateful, is that the Government propose that lone parents are to be part of the progression-to-work group from the time that their youngest child is aged one year. The Government have set out how they see that group in their discussion paper on the implementation of the Gregg review. According to their response to that review, lone parents with children aged between one and two years will be:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09060999000145"></a>&#147;Required to attend Work Focused Interviews and agree an action plan. They are not mandated to undertake any activities recorded on the action plan&#148;.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000008"></a>Paragraphs 103, 107 and 108 of the Peers&#146; information pack, however, say something that is rather different and, to me, confusing. Paragraph 103 makes it clear that there will be no conditionality applied to lone parents with children under one year old. The fact that this paragraph precedes the other two that I have mentioned must mean that there is a requirement to attend an initial interview in the child&#146;s first year of life. Indeed, paragraph 107 cements this conclusion by stating:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09060999000146"></a>&#147;It is intended that those groups&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09060999000133"></a>that is, the preparation-for-work groups&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09060999000151"></a>&#147;would include lone parents with children under 1&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09060999000134"></a>But there is an anomaly here. Paragraph 108, which covers paragraph 3 of Schedule 1, says that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09060999000147"></a>&#147;In the pathfinder areas groups such as lone parents who have a child under 1 will no longer be required to undergo work focused interviews&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000135"></a>What exactly is the proposal? Is the child to be under one, under two or under three? Whichever, I find it hard to accept that any of those is an appropriate age. What effect do the Government believe that that will have on the subsequent development of the child?</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000009"></a>I return to the Bill. The intention is that when the youngest child reaches the age of three, lone parents will be:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09060999000148"></a>&#147;Required to follow the full progression to Work regime based around Work Focused interviews, action plans, work related activity and the backstop of adviser direction&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000136"></a>I presume that that means that lone parents with children over three will be subject to the regime of sanctions for failing to comply with the requirements in the Bill. Am I wrong in that presumption? Will it be over two or over one, even? My amendment would substitute the age of three with school age as the point at which the proposed regime and all its requirements would begin. I expect that that would translate to five years of age in the large majority of cases. That age was not plucked out of the air; it was specified in the Government&#146;s July 2008 Green Paper as the appropriate age at which requirements could begin to be made on lone parents. The Green Paper envisaged piloting a requirement for lone parents whose youngest child was five or six to attend relevant skills training where that would address the skills gaps identified as a barrier to starting work. As I said, the amendment is  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>designed to stimulate a debate on the appropriate age of a child for placing certain conditions on his parent. When we come to Report, I intend to return to the issue, and it is likely that I will draft an amendment then to reflect the age of five more precisely.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000010"></a>The question at the heart of this is what approach we should be striking towards those lone parents with young children. We can all agree that it is desirable&#151;indeed, necessary&#151;to guide the unemployed back into work. However, where very young children are involved there will be a cost in terms of the bond developed, especially as we are talking about the bond between often&#151;perhaps invariably&#151;young mothers and their infants being disrupted or prevented. If we who are legislating on these matters are prepared to legislate for sanctions to be imposed on those who do not comply with the requirements we set out for them, we must be careful not to do more harm than good. The Conservative Party believes that it is inappropriate to allow advisers the power to direct parents of pre-school and young children to take part in any activity the adviser feels will move them towards work.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000011"></a>I understand that recent research for the Department for Work and Pensions looked over three years at the experiences of working single parents who had moved into paid employment voluntarily. That resulted in DWP research report 536, <I>Work and Well</I><I>-b</I><I>eing Over Time: Lone Mothers and Their Children</I><I>. </I>Those single parents and their children believed that, as the report says,</p>
<ul><a name="09060999000152"></a>&#147;lone mothers could and should work but that this was a personal choice which depended on individual circumstances and mothers should not be compelled to work&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09060999000137"></a>As well as being necessarily paternalistic, by directing people back to work we should also be realistic. If parents feel that they are required to do something that compromises the welfare of their child, they are more likely to resist those requirements.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000012"></a>I note that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has amendments later on in the Marshalled List. Perhaps it is pertinent to mention now his question on 21 May&#151;it was,</p>
<ul><a name="09060999000153"></a>&#147;does the Minister agree that the quality of the relationship and attachment between a mother and her child in the first few years of that child&#146;s life is crucial in the way in which the child develops?&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09060999000138"></a>In response, the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, replying on behalf of the Government, said,</p>
<ul><a name="09060999000154"></a>&#147;the noble Lord is absolutely correct. I pay tribute to the huge amount of work that he has done in your Lordships' House to support parents and parenthood. He is absolutely right: we&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09060999000139"></a>the Government&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09060999000155"></a>&#147;recognise the importance of supporting parents in the early years of a child&#146;s life&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/5/09; col. 1428.]</ul>
<p><a name="09060999000140"></a>That is a government view that I, and I hope all of us, commend, but I am far from certain that it fits comfortably with the threat of placing sanctions on parents who feel that they are being wrenched away from their very young children. The burdens on parents of young children are already great without the threat of sanctions. The Zacchaeus 2000 Trust has raised the worry of the mental strain becoming too much and of young mothers

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000013"></a>I should not need to repeat this as I feel that we have made it abundantly clear at so many stages, but I reiterate the support of my party for the principles in the Bill. By tabling an exclusionary clause in my first amendment, I am not undermining any of those principles: I am establishing a clear principle in support of single parents&#151;one that will help their children, help them to find work at an appropriate time and ultimately reduce poverty. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000014"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09060999000169"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> We support the amendment. There is clearly a balance to be struck between the state supporting lone parents to stay at home to raise a child and sooner or later requiring them to seek work or prepare for work as a condition of receiving benefit. On the one hand, there is the mindset that says that a single mother bringing up a child could not be doing more valuable work and it is an insult to call her workless even when her child reaches 12. On the other hand there is the view that, with the right childcare and personalised support, the best route out of poverty and off benefits is for a single parent, usually a mother, to get a job as soon as she can.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000015"></a>We on these Benches believe that the best solution is for single parents to have a choice, at the very least until their child is of school age. Yes, of course it is true that some single mothers wish to get back to the workplace to earn money as soon as possible so that they do not lose touch with the world of work. They may have perfectly adequate childcare and may be able to juggle any other commitments with a job, but there will be a huge number of mothers in a quite different position&#151;perhaps in a rural area with more than one child, or with transport and childcare problems, not to mention the difficulties of finding a suitable job with flexible working.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000016"></a>There is something faintly ludicrous about a lone mother desperately trying to find the right person to look after her child while she dashes off to an unfulfilling part-time job, when the person who should be looking after the child is herself. In all legislation, the welfare of children, particularly very young children, must take precedence over all other considerations. We therefore think that lone parents with children up to at least school age should not be required to seek work.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000017"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09060999000170"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> I, too, support the amendment moved so ably by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. I am particularly concerned about the position of single parents with children aged seven and over, who will from October 2010 have to claim JSA if they have no other source of income. Lone parents often face extra barriers to employment. A high proportion have low or no skills and very often a significant proportion will have care of a disabled child who may need full-time care. Those parents are often more vulnerable than other groups and may find themselves unemployed for more than two years and thus mandated to take part in this programme.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>

I hope that my intervention will convince him that this is a widely held belief among Members on my side of the House as well as those on the same side of the House as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. I would prefer single parents to be excluded altogether from the obligation to participate. One of the problems is that there is not much affordable childcare in many areas, which is another reason why single parents should be excluded from the requirement to participate. I hope that my noble friend will look with some sympathy on the case made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and others in support of the amendment.</p>

On the other hand, it is quite important to put on record the fact that research, cited by the Children&#146;s Society in its report <I>A Good Childhood</I>, into the effects on young children of being placed in childcare tends to support the general thrust of the Government&#146;s attempt here to encourage young children to be placed in childcare while the mother works her way back into employment. The findings of the research are interesting. I have to say that they surprised me. They tend to show that even children less than 18 months old can benefit and that the effects on cognitive development are not very substantial either way. The effects on the happiness and well-being of really quite young children who are placed in childcare are interesting. Apparently, according to the research, they are more gregarious, although the research shows that they can be more aggressive. The research is complex, but it certainly does not support my argument. I would have thought that it would have shown otherwise, but it does not. One has to hang on to that and have that on the record.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000020"></a>My concern, and my reason for supporting the amendment, has to do with the pressures on parents. I worked many years ago with young mothers who were bringing up young children and frankly having a hell of a job&#151;a very difficult job; I should use proper language in the House, I suppose&#151;managing just a home and a child. I say &#147;just&#148;; I brought up four children and know that it is a big challenge to manage a home and a child or children. The mothers with whom I worked would be unable to cope with the pressures of having to undertake work-related activities while threatened with a loss of benefits. That is why I support the amendment. For many young mothers who are struggling, to be encouraged back into work will probably be good for them and may be good for the children, but the added stress and pressure may, I fear, knock some of these mothers off their perch. They will be unable to cope. I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about these mothers. They are not disabled, and they do not have a disabled child, so they do not seem to fit into any of the exemption categories. However, a lot of mothers will not be able to cope with the challenges of this clause.</p>

It is very clear that if going back to work is not the choice of the mother, the pressure on the mother when the child goes into formal childcare means that the mother becomes a reluctant conscript in the labour market. As we know from the pressures caused by tax credits and all the rest of it, such childcare, and the mother&#146;s own guilt, means that a lone parent will very often find it very difficult to be able to stay in work because they are riven with guilt and somehow feel, rightly or wrongly, that they are letting their child down, given the quality of care available.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000022"></a>I wonder whether, in our discussions so far, we are failing properly to distinguish between a requirement to work, with appropriate sanctions, and progression-to-work training, which I understand we are asking lone parents of children between the ages of three to seven to go for. Why I support that, subject to certain considerations, is that we know that the longer someone is out of the labour market, the harder it is to get back. The best way of getting children out of poverty is to help their lone-parent mothers get back into the labour market. That does not mean requiring them to work 16 or more hours a week when their child is three, four, five, six or seven but, following the best practices of employers with staff on maternity leave for a year, trying to keep them connected with the labour market through interviews and perhaps encouraging them to do an evening course one evening a week to keep some up-to-date skills. That is helpful and positive, providing heavy sanctions are not attached and, ideally, that there is some financial reward for doing it with grace and willingness.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000023"></a>I hope the Minister will assuage the well founded worries of noble Lords by saying that the Government are not seeking to produce a regime for parents with children under the age of seven that requires them to be in work, but are seeking to keep them attached to the labour market because it is in their best interests and the child&#146;s best interests. The best way to do this is not to go heavy on sanctions, but to go light on sanctions and heavy on financial support and encouragement. That way we will get lone parents wanting to stay attached to the labour market with grace, and when their child is old enough they will then be the sort of employee any employer would want to have.</p>

Research by the Mother and Infant Research Unit of the University of York has found that in Yorkshire there is no childcare that a woman on a low income could pay for. I do not see what jobs women with no or low incomes, no education and few skills could train for at the same time as looking after their children. Most of them are working as cleaning ladies, and trying to train them to become better cleaning ladies would not help. We need to have a different vision. I am concerned that the work that women do free of charge is not recognised as work. If we want to help them, surely we should pay them for the childcare that they provide.</p>

It is when the two are brought together that there is effective support and help for children, not least in the way in which they develop their relationships with other children.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000026"></a>Parts of the Bill have an almost old fashioned tinge at the moment because one of the issues is whether there is any work available. I think particularly of inner urban areas in Yorkshire, where the number of jobs has declined sharply in recent months. That means that it will be difficult to find jobs. If we go ahead with the Bill as it stands, there will be more pressure on single parents and others to find jobs in a difficult market.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000027"></a>My only hesitation about the amendment is whether school age is the right age and whether, if we are looking for an age under which single parents should be encouraged to stay with their children and work with them, it should not be higher than five. There is a danger of a continuing gradual erosion of childhood, which is exemplified in parts of this Bill. We need to work hard to ensure that parents, whether they are lone parents or couples, are available to their children. This amendment would provide considerable support for and contribute to the family in looking after their children. I hope that we will proceed with something along these lines.</p>

Not entirely surprisingly, I also support everything that has been said today. I want to make two short points. First, I challenge the Minister to define what he means by work: I have just spent a weekend looking after my five grandchildren. Seriously, it is an issue. It is almost rude to say that looking after children and keeping a house is not work.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000029"></a>Secondly&#151;it may not be appropriate to mention this now&#151;the amendment would take the element of compulsion off the back of parents. It is very difficult for one person to be a trusted adviser and a policeman. To a considerable extent, the social services find that. I suggest that if the client is to feel that the worker in the jobcentre is an adviser and a friend, the longer we can keep the sanctions out of the picture, the better.</p>

As I come from a very rural community, perhaps I may say a few words in support of the amendment from that point of view. Public transport in our area is almost non-existent. I think that there is a bus in the morning and a bus in the evening, not at school time, and that is it. There is nothing in between. Childcare facilities are almost non-existent. Schools are fairly far between. A lot of Church of England schools have been closed, so people would have to travel quite a distance. If a parent has one child going to school and another who is very young, she will have to do a lot of juggling to meet any timetable for training. Access to training facilities is almost non-existent. The nearest town with any colleges is seven miles away and there is

<p><a name="09060999000031"></a>In the past, we would have had&#151;I benefited from it&#151;support from grandparents. My mother did not work. Nowadays, grandparents work, so they are not there for parents to fall back on. If a child is ill and needs someone to sit with them, the grandparents are not there to do it. It is most important that parental support and the lack of disruption in the child&#146;s life when it is tiny should be maintained. Therefore, I support the amendment.</p>

The amendment seeks to exclude single parents who have children under school age&#151;although that is not defined, I presume it is meant to apply to children from the age of five&#151;from any of the measures proposed in this Bill. However, I think that the noble Lord himself acknowledged that the amendment does not particularly do that because it refers to Part 1 as a whole. Part 1 includes things like payments on account, social loan provisions and issues around DLA, which I do not think was his intention. We presume that his intention was to focus on the progression-to-work pathfinders dealt with in Clause 2, but he referred to Clause 1 also. I think, and on hearing other noble Lords who have participated, that there is some confusion in this matter.</p>

Clause 1, which contains &#147;work for your benefit&#148; provisions, applies only if someone is subjected to the full JSA conditionality requirements: that they need to be available for work and that they are actively seeking work. Therefore, my noble friend Lady Turner said that we were progressively moving down the age of the youngest child to which that provision would apply until it becomes applicable to circumstances where the youngest child is aged seven. It would have no implications and no impact on situations where the youngest child is below the age of seven.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000035"></a>Clause 2 deals with the progression-to-work group&#151;this point was made by my noble friend Lady Hollis&#151;and helping lone parents and others prepare for work in relation to getting involved in work-related activity. That would apply to lone parents where the youngest child was aged under seven, but nothing in those provisions would require a parent to look for work or to take up work. We need to be clear on those two distinct provisions. Each needs to be piloted and we need to understand what we will learn from that. That is an important distinction to hold in our minds as we discuss the Bill.</p>

Evidence shows that the vast majority of parents on benefits aspire to work at some point in the future and the paid work&#151;this, in part, is the answer to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne&#151;is good for them and their children in nearly all circumstances. That is why from November 2008&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to this, as did other noble Lords&#151;we started implementing lone-parent obligations, which will progressively mean that lone parents with a youngest child aged seven or over, who claim benefit solely as a lone parent and are capable of work, will be required to be available for and actively seeking work from October 2010.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000037"></a>In support of this policy, we want to introduce a progression-to-work model which places a flexible, reasonable and personalised set of requirements on parents with younger children to help to prepare them for work. In his report, <I>Realising Potential: A Vision for </I><I>P</I><I>ersonalised </I><I>C</I><I>onditionality and Support</I>, Professor Gregg suggested that the progression-to-work group should include parents, including lone parents, with a youngest child aged between one and six. However, we intend to test progression to work with parents with a youngest child aged between three and six.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000038"></a>We are starting with this age group because there is already a strong foundation of childcare provision available to it, as children aged three and four right across the UK have access to free part-time pre-school education, and children aged five and six receive free education of up to 30 hours a week during school term-time. We also think it is right to test an approach which balances giving lone parents on benefit time to participate full-time in early childhood activities while signalling that the long-term goal for most lone parents is to return to paid work.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000039"></a>In the future, we want to ensure that preparation for paid work is a natural progression for these parents, with it being part of an ongoing journey rather than a step up. We think this will help them to enter work as quickly as possible when it is appropriate for them. But I must stress at this point that we are testing this in the pathfinders to see whether this is the appropriate age group.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000040"></a>Under the progression-to-work model, parents with younger children will be expected to agree an action plan with their adviser. This will set out the parent&#146;s individual goals, the activities they will undertake and the support they will access to undertake some form of activity that will help them in their eventual transition to work. In a sense, the role of the jobcentre adviser will change a little under this because hitherto the available programmes have generally been non-mandatory and people have been alerted as to what is on offer, whereas now there should be much more engagement with individuals to help them to understand the gaps that they have in their skills and what they might need to do to prepare for work. We will develop a much more engaged relationship.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000041"></a>When co-producing the action plan, an adviser will ensure that it will be tailored to the parent&#146;s wishes and individual circumstances before it is finalised and agreed. This action plan will take into account their individual caring responsibilities when considering what

That is especially important if parents need to plan this around their existing access to the Government&#146;s free childcare offer or school arrangements.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000042"></a>In most cases, the activities agreed as part of an action plan can be organised in such a way that they can be fitted around these hours. If that is not possible and paid childcare is needed to enable a parent to comply with any element of their work plan, that will be funded in full by Jobcentre Plus. That is vital if parents are taking part in activities that require childcare. We will also ensure that a number of safeguards will be in place where parents can refuse to take part in, or leave, the mandatory activity they have agreed without being penalised if their personal circumstances justify that. We would allow, for example, action plans to be adapted if there was bereavement, serious illness, domestic emergency or the breakdown of childcare arrangements.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000043"></a>I cannot stress enough that these pathfinders are not about forcing parents, including lone parents, into work before it is appropriate for them. These measures are designed to prepare these parents and get them ready so that work becomes a natural progression for parents with younger children. We hope that this will take them closer to the labour market so they will be able to more readily access the opportunities to lift their children out of poverty and access the full range of social, economic and community benefits that come with undertaking paid work. It would be wrong to place a specific age on the face of the Bill. When we test these measures in consultation with our stakeholders, we may decide to change the age of the youngest child if that is found to be appropriate and it is right that we should be able to do that without primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000044"></a>A number of noble Lords, particularly the noble Baronesses, Lady Meacher and Lady Hollis, referred to the research that is available and what evidence exists for the effects of maternal employment on the neurological development of children. There is a growing body of evidence that points to the importance of early years for the development of the brain, and a child&#146;s early experiences will determine whether their developing brain provides a strong or weak foundation for all future learning, behaviour and health. The early development of cognitive, social and physical abilities not only affects their school readiness, but has the potential to affect their long-term achievement, through their school lives and into adulthood. However, there is very little evidence of the specific impact of maternal employment on the neurological development of children.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000045"></a>There is some evidence on the effects of maternal employment on children's cognitive and behavioural outcomes, but that is largely inconclusive: there is little specific to the UK context. What evidence there is suggests that there are few negative effects of maternal employment once the child is aged over 18 months. The small negative effects of maternal employment appear to be greater for those whose mothers work full time rather than part time, not surprisingly. Overall, no significant difference can be identified between lone parents and mothers in couples, in terms of how their employment is related to a child&#146;s cognitive development.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC41"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000046"></a>Moreover, evidence suggests that the negative effects of early full-time maternal employment are concentrated in children who attended little or no formal childcare. The use of quality formal childcare seems to protect children from adverse effects. We have a strong body of evidence to show that good-quality early-years childcare for children aged two, three and four has a positive impact on child development, especially for disadvantaged children.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and the right reverend Prelate referred to the attachment between the parent and the child. Working parents form strong bonds with children, and research shows that on the whole they spend more quality time with their children than those who do not work. Good quality childcare plus good parental input results in the best outcomes for children.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000048"></a>The noble Countess, Lady Mar, referred to the lack of childcare and, indeed, to the lack of transport in her location. Childcare is now more widely available than ever before, and we have made considerable investment to ensure that it is also more affordable for families on low or moderate incomes. We have further amendments that will have the chance to develop this. The large majority of lone parents will be able to find the childcare that they need to enable them to return to work. However, where suitable childcare is genuinely not available, this will be taken into consideration when determining whether there is good cause for any act or omission of a lone parent. The availability of transport and the costs of transport will similarly be taken into account.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000049"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, talked about the different ages that have been referred to in various bits of documentation that have been circulated. Just to be clear, for parents whose youngest child is under the age of one, there will be no conditionality. For parents whose youngest child is aged between three and six, the proposal to be piloted is a mandatory work-focused interview with an action plan and work-related activity. For those whose youngest child is between one and two, there is the usual existing mandatory work-focused interview and action plan.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000050"></a>A number of noble Lords, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, touched on mothers under pressure and how these provisions relate to them. The point is taken, but the approach to work-related activity&#151;the progression to work&#151;provides ample scope for that to be taken into account. It is the job of the adviser to work out an action plan with the lone parent. The action plan is the format and the occasion when these issues can be reviewed and developed.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000051"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, in particular referred to childcare. The Government have invested significantly in improving the affordability of childcare. The cost of childcare is a more significant issue for parents of pre-school children, but all children aged three and four are now entitled to free part-time pre-school of 12.5 hours a week for 38 weeks of the year. Obviously that has a particular impact on reducing costs. Low-to-moderate-income families receive help with childcare costs from the tax credits system, and are entitled to help with 80 per cent of eligible costs of  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>up to &#163;175 a week for one child and &#163;300 a week for two or more children. Those limits compare favourably with typical costs.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000052"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds asked whether this was relevant if work was not available. I return to the point that Clause 1 is about &#147;work for your benefit&#148;, and that Clause 2 is about work-related activity. Notwithstanding that&#151;obviously these matters will be developed over the next few years&#151;the pathfinders will not start until next year, when the economy will be in a better shape. Even if that were not the case we have learnt that, if we are inactive about our benefits system and do not help people to get ready and to progress towards work when we are in a recession, it is much more difficult to do so later on. All the evidence shows that the longer people are on benefits, particularly inactive ones, the more difficult it is for them to get back into work.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000053"></a>I hope that I have covered each of the points that have been raised in this debate. This is an important starting point. We simply wish to reiterate the distinction between what is provided for in Clauses 1 and 2. We need to bear that in mind in our debates on subsequent amendments. I ask the noble Lord not to press his amendment. As we are in the Moses Room, I understand that he might not do so.</p>

Can my noble friend help the Committee by perhaps circulating in a letter over the next couple of days some examples of what such an action plan could realistically look like, based on a couple of lone parents&#151;one of whom might ultimately have an interest in working in a shop, and someone else who might ultimately have an interest in clerical work&#151;and what that activity would look like when a lone parent has a child under seven, so that we can be reassured that the provisions are appropriate, sensible, not oppressive and really will fit the lifestyle, stresses and problems that a lone parent faces?</p>

This is about supporting and helping them to get closer to the labour market. It might be that training is needed or just engagement with a local children&#146;s centre; it might be that along the way they should simply seek to stabilise their housing condition, to get them in a position where they are better able to take up an employment opportunity. It is not about directing people to work. It is different from the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; group, and the work experience attached to that. But I hope that that assurance will help the noble Baroness.</p>

I should also say that, as part of the pathfinders, we are seeking to test Professor Gregg&#146;s proposals on conditionality and sanctions. That approach is much more involved in co-operation, letters, warning and engaging people first before there is withdrawal of financial support. I acknowledge that some people have concerns about sanctions, but we know that if the system is to an extent mandatory and people are required to do something, if no sanctions are attached, some will not. As long as those sanctions are applied sensitively and reflect an individual&#146;s circumstances, it is right that we do that. However, we shall consider more detailed amendments on sanctions later.</p>

This note says, &#147;Exemptive on carer&#146;s allowances&#148;, which probably prevents me having to retract something that I was going to say. I think that is in the JSA regime&#151;sorry, it is in all the regimes. I was also going to say that&#151;in so far as that exemption did not apply when judgments were made about what was reasonable for lone parents to do and the availability of childcare, for example&#151;that would have to reflect the individual circumstances faced by that parent and child. If someone is on carer&#146;s allowance, they will be exempt from these provisions.</p>

Most of them were supportive in one form or another&#151;the noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas, Lady Turner and Lady Meacher, to an extent I suppose the noble Countess, Lady Mar, and of course the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, to say nothing of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000065"></a>I will start with what I might call the Yorkshire axis between the noble Baroness and the right reverend Prelate. I accept that it is extremely difficult to find jobs at the moment; indeed, I have tabled an amendment on the availability of local jobcentres to access those jobs that are available, which seems pretty deplorable, but we will get to that either later today or on Thursday. I thought at one moment that the right reverend Prelate was going to quote the Jesuits: &#147;Give me a child till he is seven and he is mine for life&#148;. Was that not a Jesuit premise? Perhaps that thought subliminally ran through many of your Lordships&#146; comments on the amendment. I must make it clear that, in the amendment, I was thinking purely and simply about lone parents. Some remarks led me to believe that your Lordships were casting the net rather more widely than I had intended.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000066"></a>The Minister told us that I was confused between Clauses 1 and 2, namely &#147;work for your benefit&#148; and progression to work. I got the impression from him that he was claiming that they were mutually exclusive. I do not think that they are; by definition, you start off being on benefit. If you are not on benefit, none of this applies.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000067"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0002.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09060999000191"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> What I was trying to convey was that, if you look in particular at the age of the youngest child for which the various provisions operate, Clause 1 operates only for those subject to the full JSA conditionality, and that cannot operate where the lone parent has a child younger than seven. That obviously is not the case for Clause 2, where we look to have work-related activity requirements where the youngest child can be between the ages of three and six; that is what the pathfinder will say. They would be mutually exclusive. Subject to the exemptions that we have touched on, if you have a lone parent with the youngest child aged seven, they will be within what is the full JSA regime at the moment, and could be subject in due course to the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; provisions, but that programme is directed at people who have been out of the labour market for some time.</p>

I also understood the Minister to say that in Clause 2&#151;the progression-to-work category&#151;no direction applies at any time. I am not sure that that is right. The clause is littered with various forms of directions.</p>

This is work-related activity, progression to work and helping people to put themselves in a position where they can take advantage of work opportunities. Certainly there would be directions because that is what the clause is all about.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000071"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, that we must not have a situation where a mother becomes a reluctant participant in the programme. As the programme is meant to lead to work&#151;ideally full-time work&#151;the likelihood of her remaining in that work is, within those circumstances, pretty limited.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000072"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, told us that the Children's Society tends to agree with the government approach but on a fairly even-handed level. In other words, I do not think, from what she said and from what I have read from the Children's Society, that it comes down firmly on one side or the other. I know she will correct me if I am wrong. She pointed out, as have various people who have written to me, and I suspect to us all, that there could well be added pressures on parents which verge&#151;or more than verge&#151;on the mental health view. I accept that. That would be the same whether there were a single parent or two parents, would it not?</p>

<p><a name="09060999000079"></a>With their something-for-something welfare reform agenda, the Government are committed to offer greater and more effective employment support for which benefit recipients must do more to obtain work. This legislation will allow sanctions to be applied to those who fail to comply. In its published research on the impact of Pathways to Work, the DWP acknowledges that people over the age of 50 may need more assistance with moving off incapacity benefits than younger people. Evaluations of New Deal 25 plus have also found that the type of provision available has not always been appropriate to older clients.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000080"></a>Research commissioned by Age Concern in 2006 found that personal advisers did not necessarily have the awareness, skills and confidence to provide the type of personalised support suited to older clients. In March 2009, Age Concern and Help the Aged commissioned IFF Research to conduct a qualitative research of jobseeker&#146;s allowance, incapacity benefit and employment support allowance recipients over the age of 50, and I will depend heavily on that research for what I have to say.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000081"></a>The research included recent and longer-term claimants with varied personal circumstances and work backgrounds. Some had held professional posts until relatively recently. Others had complicated mental or physical health histories and had struggled to work for a long time. Overall, the research found that the intervention and support for the over-50s is woefully inadequate. There is little evidence that Jobcentre Plus provides effective support for them. Conversely, there is evidence that age discrimination in the workplace is the biggest barrier to them returning to work. Many over-50s welcome the prospect of greater and more effective employment support, particularly adviser support, the development of an action plan and the availability of training and development.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000082"></a>Given that almost no subject who took part in the research could recall being offered any appropriate support activities, they did not consider these activities should be mandatory. They felt that mandating participating in work or work-related activities was missing the point at best and potentially harmful at worst. IB claimants found the threat of sanctions

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000083"></a>Many of those interviewed said that advisers often made inappropriate suggestions. For example, a woman who had previously been a lecturer in adult education was told to apply for a position as an engineering lecturer. Another, an engineer, was told to apply for a job as a toilet cleaner. Participants who agreed to apply for recommended jobs reported feeling ridiculous, as they were aware that they had no experience in the area but felt that they had to apply or their benefits would be affected.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000084"></a>Many mentioned that only low skilled work was available. At the expiry of 13 weeks on benefits, they reported that minimum-wage jobs were frequently suggested to them, regardless of their experience or skills. Those with higher skills reported lower expectations of the support the JCP service provides and regarded staff more as administrators than advisers. On the other hand, over-50s with lower skills wanted career guidance and were disappointed when JCP failed to meet that need. There was a perception among the over-50s in receipt of JSA that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09060999000150"></a>&#147;JCP offers an impersonal service, weighed down with bureaucracy and chasing targets&#148;.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000085"></a>I have already mentioned that age discrimination by employers is a major barrier to returning to work. The recession has compounded jobseekers&#146; views that there are even fewer quality jobs available to them. Publicity about the dearth of jobs available to recent university graduates has not helped to alleviate that view. Employers, somewhat naturally, are likely to select a young person who will work for a lower salary than they are an older, well qualified and experienced person. A substantial majority of unemployed men and women over 50 are unemployed for no reason other than the circumstances that currently pertain. They want to work, but circumstances are against them. They already have established work habits and routines. It appears unreasonable that someone who is up against it should be penalised when one half of the something-for-something bargain is not in place.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000086"></a>Amendment 27 proposes that the Secretary of State commissions his own research to ascertain the over-50s&#146; experience in jobseeking and what would improve their chances of obtaining employment. It is clear that the Government lack the evidence to support their position that everyone under pensionable age should be governed by this legislation. Until workplace age discrimination is dealt with and appropriate facilities and assistance are made available by JCP, I hope that the Minister will agree that the over-50s should be relieved of the conditionality conditions and that he will accept my amendments. I beg to move.</p>

There is no doubt that once older people are out of work for more than six months, the chances of them working again are low. In the past year, unemployment has risen by 48 per cent among the 50-plus age group, which is faster than for any other age group, and it is still rising. In the present climate, there is not only a lack of suitable jobs, but evidence that older people are not

For example, some of the support is help on how to write a CV and training in interview techniques, which is not much help for an older person who may have been made redundant several times and has been unemployed for two years.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000088"></a>Undoubtedly, the greatest barrier is age discrimination, as the noble Countess, Lady Mar, has said, which is the chief finding of research carried out by Age Concern and Help the Aged. Does the DWP have up-to-date research on the best way to help the over-50 age group find work? Listening to the &#147;You and Yours&#148; radio programme today about unemployment, a woman reported having her CV returned, having failed to get a job, with her age highlighted. Another older woman was told, &#147;Oh, you sounded much younger on the telephone&#148;. Many of those aged over 50 now out of work would have been working for more than 30 years and will not need the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; regime to instil discipline into their lives. They are desperate to get a job. They need not only the right help from properly trained JCP staff, but for employers to be encouraged to take older workers. I strongly support the grouped amendment about research into the employment prospects of those aged over 50.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000089"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09060999000202"></a>Baroness Afshar:</b> In the case of the ethnic minorities, we often find that the over-50s do not speak English, are not literate in English and are not familiar with the processes. If they were required to do so, they could not write a CV. In Bradford, classes for minority women were provided, but because they did not pass the exams and therefore the outcome could not be measured, those classes were closed. There is a whole category of people who are invisible and who cannot survive, let alone get skilled to join the labour market.</p>

I have done some work for Age Concern in the past and have spoken from time to time on the employment of older people. I should particularly like to draw attention to the provisions in Amendment 27, which recommends a programme of research into employment prospects for people aged over 50. That is necessary because the Government want us all to go on working for longer since we all live longer. Ultimately, we will have to work a great deal longer than we have hitherto, perhaps for longer than my generation has had to work. This means that some pressure has to be exerted on employers to provide the employment opportunities. There is some evidence that the provisions existing in regard to the default retirement age have given employers the opportunity to dispense with the services of older people when they might otherwise not have done so. There is a need for research of the kind recommended in this group of amendments. It would be a good idea to ascertain the position of older people who want to be in the employment market but are finding it increasingly difficult to do so.</p>

Oddly, one of the benefits of the current appalling recession is that it has put into perspective this particular group of people, who will quite obviously have their situation worsened. I think that we all agree that there is already a certain amount of age discrimination among employers, which has been thrown into much sharper relief by the situation that we are all in.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000092"></a>The point that has just been made about the need for the Government to do some research into this area is important and, again, part of an amendment in this group. One would like to see far more thought being given to the long-term question of the need we will all have to continue in work of one sort or another, and to what extent that should include voluntary work and more guidance into second and third careers&#151;at least as much for women as for men. How we work ourselves out of an aging society will depend on the consideration that this is given at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000093"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09060999000205"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> There is no doubt that the debate on welfare reform has hardly scratched the surface of the impact on older workers, so I am grateful to the noble Countess, Lady Mar, for her explanation of this set of amendments. However, I rather regret that I am only partially convinced by them. There is a weakness in the labour market for those who would not thank me for describing them as being &#147;of advancing years&#148;; indeed, neither the noble Countess nor I would welcome that description being applied to ourselves. Nevertheless, the problem is increased by the recession, which makes older workers more vulnerable to being passed over when it comes to finding new employment opportunities.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000094"></a>I have no doubt that the Minister will tell us that the Government are committed to ensuring all forms of equality and doing away with anything that might be seen as ageist. That is all well and good and, of course, we commend it. However, we must not overlook the fact that, as the noble Countess made clear, those people who are over 50 and find themselves out of work might not have skills and qualifications that are as transferable or adaptable as those of people who are younger and acquired their skills more recently. In those circumstances, it should be a sine qua non that reskilling will be discussed at the work-focused interview; I hope that the Minister can confirm that.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000095"></a>In this connection, I have a tenant in part of my house who some years ago lost his job as an under-manager for a large hardware chain and found that no similar job was available locally. He then discovered that there was a job vacancy as a baker in a local supermarket, for which he applied. He got the job and was retrained. I am sure that noble Lords can think of people in similar situations; indeed, I can think of one fairly close to the Minister: his predecessor.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000096"></a>Joking apart, these examples are, to an extent, voluntary. The Bill talks of an element of compulsion, but the examples are pertinent for all that. Given that the age at which people are deemed to be too old for the workplace, and therefore eligible for their pensions, is by necessity rising, it is essential that we do not have a situation where there are large numbers of people,

In that respect, the noble Countess has a good point that steps ought to be taken to identify need and address problems. However, is that not true of all age groups? It is what, I presume, the tailored, personalised work interviews with a personal adviser will look at. They will identify any special experience and support which each person requires to help them back into work. Again, I am sure that the Minister can confirm that. The noble Countess&#146;s proposals are, therefore, probably unnecessary and potentially damaging to the very people whom she aims to assist. The amendments would take the over-50s out of the scheme being set up by Clause 1 and hold them apart indefinitely, while a programme of research is carried out.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000097"></a>If there needs to be some kind of investigation into unemployment among the over-50s, it would be better if it were conducted concurrently with the new welfare provisions and could then be used to inform the personal advisers if any change in their approach to older jobseekers needed to be made. That would inform not only the personal advisers but the Government, because this Bill is, as we all noted at Second Reading, littered with negative resolution orders, for the very reason that rapid changes may need to be made. This is one case whereby, as a result of the research that the noble Countess is calling for, a rapid change may very well need to be made&#151;perhaps more than one.</p>

Perhaps I should know this, but I do not. I know that when we were exploring the New Deal for Partners, which very often tended to be for older people who were both unemployed&#151;it was not a particularly successful scheme&#151;one of the problems, given what is happening to the labour market, is particularly for older men who may have been in semi-skilled heavy work, who lose their job at 50 to 55 and cannot go back to work, except perhaps to become even further deskilled as a building labourer. That, too, would depend on the situation in the construction industry, and so on. They find it very difficult to get back into full-time work. Women with a partner, because they are usually willing and able to take part-time work, find that there is far more flexibility.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000099"></a>Perhaps my noble friend can tell me whether the Government have given any thought or carried out any research on whether we could treat the total work hours of a couple together to make the equivalent of one full-time job, so that they could come into the tax credit regime, if appropriate. He might work for 16 hours and she might work for 15 or 16 hours. In practical terms that would take them over the 30-hour rule. Both would get easier access to the labour market, they might be able to work non-social hours, Box and Cox with each other, and so on. They would then stay attached to the labour market, and as and when conditions were right, they might be able to increase their hours. Perhaps they could be treated jointly.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000100"></a>I realise that there are bureaucratic complexities, but if we are not doing this, perhaps we could start to think out of the box on this. If the two did a part-time job of 15 or 16 hours each, together that hits the 30-hour rule which would therefore become a full-time job, and would qualify them for working tax credit, if appropriate, and both partners would be happy, satisfied and remain attached to the labour market. I should have consulted my noble friend in advance, and I apologise; but if we are doing any work on this, can he help me, because it would be a natural extension to the work being explored previously by the department on the New Deal for Partners?</p>

My fundamental concern, which I share with the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is that the amendments could limit the levels of support that we can give to jobseekers aged over 50 at a time when we are more than ever committed to increasing employment opportunities for younger and older people. The impact of these amendments would also be inconsistent with our approach to older workers. Our active ageing policies are designed to help people to remain in the labour market for as long as possible, and we are not writing people off when they reach the age 50. People are living longer; older people are healthier and more active than ever before and want to be able to work.</p>

We need to ensure that our back-to-work help operates equally and fairly for all ages.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000103"></a>At this juncture, I will revert to some statistics because there are assertions that employers are not so willing to employ older people or that for older people employment is more challenging than for other groups. The employment rate for people aged 50 to state pension age has increased in recent years. The employment rate for men of that age is now higher than at any other point since the mid-1980s&#151;higher than the employment peak of 1990. Currently&#151;I suspect that these figures are a little out of date but they are illustrative&#151;the employment rate for people aged 50 to state pension age is 71.9 per cent overall, with 72.9 per cent for men and 70.5 per cent for women. The employment rate for people aged 25 to 49 is 81 per cent. Of course, around 1.3 million people are working past state pension age.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000104"></a>Helping older people to remain in work is good for individuals because it increases their income and enables them to make better provision for their retirement. It is good for employers, who can benefit from the skills and experience they can bring to their business. It is  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>good for the economy because it increases productivity and tax receipts from increased numbers in employment. Let me explain how each of the amendments could unfairly restrict the back-to-work help that is available to older people.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000105"></a>The amendment to Clause 1 would mean that customers aged 50 and over could not be required to participate in &#147;work for your benefit&#148;. I can see no circumstances in which that would be desirable. As many of us in this Room know, being over 50 is not a bar to enjoying the full benefits of a working life. Indeed, as our population ages, we should expect more and more older people to be in work, and we need to do everything we can to help them do so. &#147;Work for your benefit&#148; is a programme designed to help people into work; therefore I cannot see why we would want to deny this group the support that it offers.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000106"></a>The entire direction of welfare reform is to base the support that individuals receive on their personal circumstances, to work with each person and determine what support they need, and not to make broad assumptions about their capabilities or barriers to work based only on their age or any other shared characteristic. The amendment would seriously undermine that approach. That is not in the interests of either the individual or a wider society facing the challenges of an ageing population.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000107"></a>The amendment to Clause 8 would exclude ESA customers who are over 50 from the specific work-related activity requirement, which is a key plank of the progression-to-work model proposed by Professor Gregg. Evidence suggests that conditionality, coupled with support, is effective in moving people closer to work. Pathways to Work increases the chance of a new customer being in employment after 18 months by around 25 per cent and saves the taxpayer &#163;1.50 for every pound invested.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000108"></a>In introducing progression to work, we want to build on the success of pathways in order to help more customers to move closer to work. Within these pathfinders, we will therefore be introducing the requirement for customers to undertake at least one activity between work-focused interviews to support their own route back to work.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000109"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will agree that many ESA customers over 50 will have a great deal to contribute to the labour market, and it is wrong to expect that people will not work again just because they have reached a certain age. I am also sure that many customers in this group would like to find work. It is generally recognised that being out of work and on benefit is bad for health and well-being. ESA customers who are over 50 are not excluded from the current pathways system. It would be wrong to exclude them from the conditionality underpinning progression to work and the benefits that this may provide in helping them move closer to work.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000110"></a>Clause 2 will apply to claimants receiving income support and to the partners of claimants of other working-age benefits. However, the partner of a recipient of a working-age benefit may themselves be over pension age. In that case, we would not wish them to be subject to this clause. That is why the new  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC53"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Section 2D(2)(a) of the Social Security Administration Act inserted by this clause imposes these requirements only on those partners who are &#147;under pensionable age&#148;. The amendment would ensure that these requirements would apply only to partners of benefit recipients who are under the age of 50. That would create a different approach between claimants and their partners.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000111"></a>The conditionality regimes for those claiming working-age benefits apply for as long as they continue to receive the benefit to which those conditions attach; that is, until they reach pensionable age. There is no evidence that would support the imposition of a different age limit for claimants and their partners and such an approach would be confusing to families and add complexity to the benefit system.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000112"></a>The amendment to Clause 26 would exempt customers who are 50 or over from the new benefit sanction that we are introducing for failure to attend mandatory appointments within the JSA regime. The new sanction will help to enforce a key element of the JSA regime&#151;attending mandatory appointments. These appointments act as a gateway to the support on offer to help customers back to work. They also act as a crucial checkpoint in ensuring that customers are actively seeking and available for work&#151;the fundamental conditions of receiving jobseeker&#146;s allowance.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000113"></a>The over-50s are fully integrated within the JSA regime. They benefit from back-to-work support alongside younger jobseekers and receive targeted help through the New Deal 50-plus, which provides job search assistance, training opportunities and work placements. As the over-50s receive the same level of employment support as other jobseekers it is only right that they are also subject to the same sanctions when they fail to comply. Indeed, evidence suggests that conditionality, coupled with support, is effective in moving people closer to work. We can see no case for making an arbitrary distinction at the age of 50 or any other point during a person's working age. All jobseekers should be treated equally; it would be unfair on younger jobseekers if older customers were exempted from the sanction.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000114"></a>Clause 28, as it stands, will ensure that not only people up to the age of 59 as currently, but also those aged 60 and over up to pensionable age, will get the additional help offered by work-focused interviews when claiming income support or incapacity benefit. Everyone up to pensionable age should be able to expect to get the additional back-to-work support offered by work-focused interviews.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000115"></a>The noble Countess recommended a programme of research. I am pleased to say that we already have an extensive programme of published and planned research and analysis covering the employment position of people aged 50 and over. We are committed to increasing the employment of people aged 50 and over and this research and analysis is important in informing our future progress.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000116"></a>The evidence for pathways was mentioned, specifically that it does not work for people over 50. As the noble Countess said, it is true that the evidence shows that pathways for existing and new repeat customers is

That will not be the case for new ESA customers, who will be subject to the conditionality under the progression-to-work system. New ESA customers who are over 50 will have particular barriers to work, but we are confident that with the support of their personal advisers, they will be able to overcome these barriers and will be able to do a great deal to support their own route back to work. We will pilot a regime to test what support will be most effective for longer-term benefit claimants who are over 50.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000117"></a>I was asked what safeguards will be built into the progression-to-work system to protect the needs of people over 50? When agreeing work-related activity or issuing customers with a direction to undertake specific work-related activities, personal advisers must have regard to what would be reasonable in the customer&#146;s circumstances. That would include taking into consideration any relevant factors connected with the customer&#146;s age. If the customer feels that the requirement on him is unreasonable, he will be able to request that it is reconsidered under the provisions for reconsideration of an action plan. That is Section 14(4) of the Welfare Reform Act 2007.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000118"></a>If the customer fails to undertake the activity, he will be asked whether he can show good cause for that before a sanction is considered. We are setting out good-cause considerations in regulations. Evidence of good cause may include demonstrating that the conclusions from the work-focused health-related assessment or work-focused interview, which led to a direction, had not been or were no longer appropriate or relevant to the claimant&#146;s circumstances. If the claimant is sanctioned for failing to undertake the activity, he will be able to appeal the decision to sanction.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000119"></a>We are committed to increasing employment opportunities for older workers. Our programme of research is designed to help us to build further on our support and to share good practice across providers of our back-to-work support.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000120"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, asked about older workers who cannot speak English. That is a very important point. I would like to write to her in some detail about what should be available at Jobcentre Plus. Certainly there is support for translation and the right to have someone attend an interview with you. With the information I have available, I do not think I can do justice to the support that should be available. In those circumstances, we always need to seek to ensure that it is delivered in a manner in which it is meant to be delivered.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000121"></a>My noble friend Lady Turner referred to the default retirement age, a debate which runs on. She will be aware that we are committed to review that in 2011. One can see the benefits of it being extinguished. Many employers do not operate it anyway, in particular, I am pleased to say, the DWP.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000122"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, made the key point that we all have to work longer. On pensions, we have debated what has happened to longevity and to  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC55"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the demographics. There are fewer people around to support the state pension system in comparison with the number of pensioners. Working longer to avoid poverty in older age is one way through that.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000123"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to age discrimination. It is absolutely right that we should do everything that we can to challenge discrimination on any grounds and certainly on the ground of age. We believe that it is important that older workers get the help and support that they need to enable them to return to work. I hope that, having heard the explanation, the noble Countess will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000124"></a>Another key point is the training given to Jobcentre Plus advisers. That issue will run through many of the debates in Committee and perhaps we shall have an opportunity to focus on that in more detail later. It is certainly an important point.</p>

<p><a name="09060999000125"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09060999000209"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> I am very grateful to noble Lords who took part in the debate and for the support for my amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, stressed the increase in the numbers of those over 50 who have become unemployed in recent months since the recession began. The noble Baroness, Lady Turner, confirmed my feelings about the need for more research. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that they are doing constant research. If he could let me know, in a letter, the type of research being done I would be very grateful. As the Minister said, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, raised very valid points.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000126"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, puzzled me, but perhaps we do not have the rapport that we should have because he thought I did not support him fully in his amendment, but I do. He mentioned reskilling, with which there is a problem. I am concerned that the system is unable to cope. There are not enough properly trained people to deal with the over-50s and understand the man who has worked for a motor-car factory for 30 years and suddenly finds himself, with very little notice, out of work. He might stand at the factory gate with a television interviewer with a microphone in his hand and say, &#147;I have done this for 30 years and I do not know what I am going to do&#148;. That must be very distressing for him and all the people around him. There is a real need for people who understand the pressures that these people are under.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09060999000127"></a>I thought that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, suggested a very bright idea. The Minister did not respond to it, but it would be nice and very helpful if he could take it on board and think about it. The Minister talked about equality and I would talk also about fairness. Employers are taking a long time to catch up with Her Majesty&#146;s Government. They do not seem to observe the age discrimination rules as they should. Far too many people have been turned down for employment or even sacked simply because they are aged over 50 and are extra to the employer&#146;s needs. Most of these people want to be in work and want to stay in work. I am not asking for them to be left out so that they can slack about and do nothing on benefits. The conditionality must be coupled with support, which is not always there, and is what I tried to stress.</p>

Of course the labour market is challenging at the moment, but we should not overlook the fact that there still is a dynamic market. Each month, if we look at the number of people who go on to JSA and those who come off, and look at the vacancies flowing through the system, there is activity in the labour market. I accept her point entirely that, until we get the economy around the corner and growing again, the full range of opportunities that we would like to see will not be available.</p>

She is aware that, as regards couples where one or both are disabled, they can access tax credit at 16 hours of work. Otherwise, as she said, it has to be 30 hours of work. In terms of the proposition to combine the position of couples, I would use the escape clause that this is Treasury policy. But it is an interesting idea and worth pursuing. As my noble friend intimated, there would be complexities about how you would join two people for certain bits of the system where they otherwise are taxed individually. There is some complexity in all that, but let us reflect on it.</p>

If you are going to have such a fundamental change in the strategic approach, you should have a proper Bill about it with a couple of proper sections that set out the strategy and enshrine the principles so that we can all have a proper look at them.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000003"></a>This is also a skeletal Bill, and the regulations that flow from it will therefore be difficult to track. They will deal with pilots which last for up to three years, which is another change that has been made. Pilots used to only be for one year. Indeed, in the Jobseekers Act 1995, pilots were only possible when they assisted people. These pilots actually require people to do things. I notice that there was a little finessing of Section 29 of the 1995 Act that enabled the former pilots. That has been changed so that there is broader access to pilots&#151;or are they pathfinders? I do not know when a pathfinder is a pilot or vice versa; it is difficult to make sense of where the legal authority for pathfinders comes from.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000004"></a>I make the general opening point that we are all going to struggle. I will struggle in a minute, with a little flexibility from colleagues. We need to identify the key areas of the principle of this new policy and find ways of discussing them in spite of the actual sections of the Bill in front of us. Having got that off my chest, I perfectly well understand where we are: this is a new employment programme. Actually, it does not need much legislation because employment programmes, such as new deals and things, have been done in the past using administrative procedures.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000005"></a>Clause 1 is about &#147;work for your benefit&#148; schemes. I also object&#151;I will stop being angry in a minute&#151;to the use of inverted commas to do violence to the English language. As other colleagues have noticed, work, which I understand to be paid employment&#151;a contract between an employer and an employee&#151;is nowhere near this clause. The fees of the parliamentary draftsman who came up with the ingenuity of using inverted commas to make the English language mean something that it does not really say should be deducted. Something should happen to him or her; conditionality should be applied.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000006"></a>I have this in my mind as stage 5 of the Flexible New Deal, where people have been in public service for 12 months and getting assistance, and then go to a provider for specialist provision. They have therefore been out of work for two years and are then considered for &#147;work for your benefit&#148;. There are other routes into it, but that is where we are. We are therefore only dealing with the real jobseeker&#146;s allowance&#151;that of people who really need to seek jobs as well as claim the allowance. I understand that.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000007"></a>I use that context as a proxy for a debate about a much wider, fundamentally important essence of welfare to work. I know this because I have looked at schemes internationally. Indeed, the Gregg review refers, interestingly, to some of the Scandinavian schemes, and particularly those of the Netherlands, where it is a given that universal childcare is available. There is no question about that. Around every corner and in every precinct and community, families have ready access to childcare that is not just about looking after your  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>children&#151;all the things in the amendment&#151;but guaranteed. There are entitlements to childcare in these countries. There is predictable access: the parents know exactly where they are in terms of when they have to deliver and can collect children. It is good quality because it is monitored by the state. It is affordable, and it is flexible. All these elements need to be guaranteed before you can seriously begin to deliver what Professor Gregg is trying to do with his new policy.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000008"></a>As has been referred to earlier, we all know the difficulties that that system brings in a United Kingdom context. There are four nation states in the United Kingdom. Of course, Professor Gregg&#146;s remit in his report was to look at the situation in England. The English situation is clear and is set out on page 92. I think the 10-year childcare strategy has been developed since he wrote his report. It talks about universal schooling. There is a three and four year-old part which is not there yet but is to be in place by 2010. How safe will it be to fund? I do not have experience of the English education system but the third bullet point in the report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609102000020"></a>&#147;By 2010 all parents with children aged 5-11 will be offered affordable, school based childcare on weekdays between the hours of 8 am and 6 pm all year round&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609102000018"></a>I shall believe that when I see it.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000009"></a>Professor Gregg carried out this piece of work before the credit crunch really matured. We are now a nation facing a public sector borrowing requirement of &#163;175 billion. That is the foundation of this policy. If it is not in place, the policy will not work. It goes on to talk about every community having easy access to a Sure Start children's centre by 2010. Some of these provisions have a pie-in-the-sky element to them. This 2008 report was probably written in 2007 and things have moved on.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000010"></a>It is not safe for this Grand Committee to allow the Bill to pass without absolutely cast-iron guarantees and assurances in cold print that what is in Professor Gregg's submission for his policy initiative, written in 2008, will be delivered. This policy will not be implemented unless it is delivered. It is as important as that. I do not think Scotland will be in that position by 2010, so we are in danger of disadvantaging people who live north of the border. There are precedents for delaying important parts of social policy because of the different backup support in other parts of the United Kingdom. The Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 was delayed by four years in Scotland simply because the backup support and aftercare was not available there. The Government were big enough to recognise that and so it took an extra four years to bring that piece of legislation safely into being north of the border. For all I know, that might well be the case in Northern Ireland and in Wales.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000011"></a>This subject is that important to the successful deployment of this policy. We really need assurances because people are frightened about this policy and I am not surprised because the past experience of conditionality and so on has been dire. Bearing in mind that this will not all be delivered by Jobcentre Plus professional staff, the Government&#146;s response to Gregg said that there will be 9,000 personal advisers. It will be delivered by people like the Wise Group and,  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC59"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>like everything else in life, there are good providers and less good providers. If Professor Gregg is saying that co-ownership is the core of this policy, what will be the relationship between the personal adviser and the parents who say, &#147;If I take this advice because of the deployment of this policy, it will prejudice my family&#146;s and my children's development&#148;? Where will the balance lie? Who will make the final decision? What examples are there of what the Government have considered would be a reasonable decision?</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000012"></a>Professor Gregg is right. On the next amendment I may surprise people by supporting the Government more than they might imagine from the position I am taking now, but the key thing about Gregg is that he gives the claimant the voice, whereas the Bill gives the personal adviser the decision. He is making a decision about children's development in relation to childcare. There should be a balanced negotiation involving some guarantee of control in any decision about whether jobseeking conditions should continue to apply, but it has been left to a personal adviser who may be on a contract. The situation remains opaque, and is set against a background of where this policy has been in the past. I am not surprised that people are really frightened about it.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000013"></a>Other colleagues have made the point about morality and transport and issues of that kind, which all compound the difficulty of providing childcare sensibly. If people cannot go the distance and find the necessary public transport, that is difficult. This is a crucial area. I do not know how the pilots or pathfinders will work around this. It would be interesting to know if you could find an area that had all the childcare provisions to which Professor Gregg aspires in 2010. You could try this in an area such as that and then try it in a much more challenged area such as rural Wales in the valleys, where transport is difficult, and compare and contrast them. For all I know, these pilots will last for three years.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090609102000014"></a>There is another point that colleagues need to remember. I understand perfectly well about the lack of jobs but Professor Gregg is talking about this policy continuing for 20 years after this recession is over. That is where he is starting and that is the vision that his document contains, if he is to be believed. It will take a long time to get this right, but we cannot safely introduce this policy at all unless childcare is guaranteed. I, for one, am not convinced that that will be the case in 2010, when this legislation is enacted. I beg to move.</p>

I see many things as I go around the country. The other day I visited a children's centre, which shall be nameless, and it was excellent. I asked people there, &#147;How many children do you manage in this nursery school?&#148; They answered that 29 was their maximum. I then embarrassed them by asking how many children of an appropriate age there were in the area that it served. After a certain amount of thought they came up with a figure of 700. I admit that there were two other children&#146;s centres in that area, but I regret to say to the Minister that I think that he is

I do not believe that a lot of it is the case in terms of the availability of childcare in this country today, nor the quality of it. What I hear is that, because of the important conditions that the Government are laying down for childcare to ensure quality, quite a lot of child carers are dropping out of the system. We must also recognise that we are in a fluid situation. If we get our facts wrong on this point, we will do something very bad for the children of this country.</p>

It might have been better if they had all come up together. I support the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, because, as other noble Lords have said, the availability of childcare is a major issue. I am unsure about the capacity of personal advisers to make these decisions about what childcare facilities should be accepted by the parent. The parent should have the final decision about whether or not childcare is satisfactory. There are major issues around childcare and I simply wanted to log my support for the concerns already expressed. I will return to these issues later.</p>

So many Bills that overlap to a certain extent are currently going through, and this issue also comes up under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill. Reading the debates in the other place clearly indicates that there is concern about proper use and involvement of the voluntary sector, which for so many years was the only provider of childcare. Because it is relevant to this and the many other Bills that we will no doubt be dashing from one Committee Room to another to try and take part in, I would like to know exactly what the Government think the pool of childcare is, and whether it involves a proper use of those facilities. I personally know that many are closing down as a result of the centres understandably wanting to concentrate their activities in this one area. I would be grateful if the Minister could take that point on board.</p>

The question is how you deal with it.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000005"></a>In moving the amendment, the noble Lord made an impassioned plea for considering the importance of childcare. This obviously ties in with our opening debate on school-age children when I pointed out the obvious: parents will understandably be reluctant to get involved with any scheme that they might consider to adversely impact upon their children. Many of your Lordships agreed with me, including the noble Countess, Lady Mar; I was listening.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000006"></a>For those parents with children over school age and therefore subject to the new proposals, the availability of childcare is a vital consideration in helping them make decisions about what they feel that they are able to do for themselves: preparing for work, being in work and so on. I may have misunderstood the problem, but I was informed that it was a particular concern in Scotland, where the Childcare Act 2006, which put a duty only on councils in England and Wales to provide sufficient childcare for working parents, does not apply; I am sure that the noble Lord would be the first to comment on whether I am right or wrong. This Bill covers Scotland as well.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000007"></a>I expect that childcare will form a major part of the agreement reached between the adviser and the parent seeking work. Perhaps the Minister will be able to develop this point for us when he responds. What will happen to those parents who need childcare but cannot find any suitable? The Minister has already said this afternoon that, in that case, there will be no need for lone parents to be subject to the rigours of Clause 2. Indeed, that comment was made both in Committee and, I think, on Report in another place.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000008"></a>The important thing is for us to discover how flexible the new provisions will be when taking childcare into account. The Liberal Democrat amendments raise the question of predictable access to childcare. The wording of the amendments is perhaps a little problematic, but I shall come to that in a minute. I am interested to hear the Minister explain how the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; schemes can be applied satisfactorily in cases where access to childcare is available&#151;but they may well change.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000009"></a>For example, a programme which is agreed with a parent may take account of there being childcare available after school hours from 3 pm to 5 pm&#151;the noble Lord said 6 pm, but it does not really matter. What if, two months down the line, when school breaks up for its first holiday, it turns out only then that the necessary childcare is not available? Will there be sufficient flexibility built into the system to cope with that? The problem I see with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, important as it is, is that it is very difficult to legislate explicitly for predictability. Having childcare available when it is needed is, of course, highly desirable; in fact, it is more than highly desirable, it is essential. However, it is rather more difficult to guarantee it. Rather, we need to make sure  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the scheme is sufficiently tailored to allow maximum flexibility, so that, instead of fixing events into a back-to-work plan, the plan is adaptable enough to react to events. I hope that the Minister will agree that this would be the right approach, rather than trying to put words into legislation.</p>

<p><a name="090609114000010"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090609114000029"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Amendment 3 would mean that claimants could be required to participate in &#147;work for your benefit&#148; programmes only where there is a guaranteed and predicable source of good quality, affordable and flexible childcare available to them that meets the needs of the parents and the child or children in the claimant&#146;s household. That is the thrust of the point which the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, expanded on. When he introduced his amendment, he ranged more widely and perhaps I may comment on a couple of his points.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000011"></a>He talked about the structure of the Bill being a framework Bill. That is not unusual; as the noble Lord will well know, social security Bills and welfare benefit Bills are structured on that basis, partly because piloting or pathfinders are embedded within them, and there is a need for flexibility on some of the detail in due course.</p>

<p><a name="090609114000012"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="090609114000030"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Will the Minister accept that this has been a growing phenomenon over the period of this Government? There have been an awful lot of framework Bills, especially in the work and pensions area, which are supplemented by secondary legislation. It has always been extremely difficult to cut through the framework of the Bill to understand exactly what will happen. This is why so many amendments that have been tabled would be described by the officials behind him as &#147;niggling&#148;. They are not niggling at all.</p>

<p><a name="090609114000013"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090609114000031"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I accept that any amendment has a proper purpose behind it. I do not mind how many there are, as long as we have the time to get through them all. I would not accept without detailed evidence the proposition that the use of a framework approach to legislation has become worse or grown under this Government. It certainly existed under the previous Government.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000014"></a>Amendment 49 would make similar provision with respect to work-related activity under Clause 2. I fully understand why the noble Lord and the noble Baroness have tabled this amendment but I hope I can reassure Members of the Committee that it is not necessary. Parents who are mandated to &#147;work for your benefit&#148; schemes need reassurance that their children will be cared for in a safe and secure environment while they participate. This is less likely to be an issue for parents undertaking work-related activities under Clause 2 because it should be possible, for the most part, to build these activities around their caring responsibilities. However, there will be instances where participation may require the use of childcare. Some parents may be able to call on informal sources of care, such as grandparents, to meet their needs. This is the choice made by many working parents. Others may require formal, paid childcare.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000015"></a>The first reassurance that I can give noble Lords is that, when setting up their jobseeker&#146;s agreement, parents can agree certain restrictions on their availability for

A lone parent may, for example, agree with their adviser that their caring responsibilities mean that they have to restrict their job search to employment of 20 hours a week. In this instance, they would not be required to participate in a &#147;work for your benefit&#148; scheme for more than 20 hours a week.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000016"></a>I also reassure noble Lords that, for those who choose to use formal childcare, affordability should not be an issue. Parents who necessarily incur childcare costs when participating in &#147;work for your benefit&#148; programmes or work-focused activities will have all reasonable costs met. This will ensure that childcare is affordable and that customers on employment programmes are not worse off by virtue of the requirement to participate.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000017"></a>Of course, the availability of suitable provision may be as significant an issue for parents as affordability, and these amendments seek to ensure that a person could be required to participate in such a scheme only where there is guaranteed and predictable access to good-quality, affordable and flexible childcare.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090609114000018"></a>I have to point out there can be no absolute guarantee that a parent will be able to access exactly the childcare that they need.</p>

One might conceive of circumstances in which, perhaps in extremis, an individual was restrictive and rejected what was available locally.

I am a little confused now. If it is to be the parent who decides but there is a view that they may be being unreasonable, what is the process then? What will the penalties be? We need to understand this as the Bill goes through.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000002"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="090609152000181"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The process will clearly be an engagement between the Jobcentre Plus adviser and the individual. I envisage information being provided to the parent about what is available locally and what could be accessible. One cannot be certain about all these things, but I guess we can all envisage circumstances in which a lone parent might use childcare issues to avoid their obligations. A judgment might be made at some point. Given all the information, all the provision that is out there and the fact that the costs of it will be met in appropriate circumstances by Jobcentre Plus, if a lone parent still refuses to access childcare, the provisions for sanctions and conditionality will kick in. That is a different situation from a Jobcentre Plus adviser saying on a routine basis, &#147;You must place your child in this provision&#148;. That is not what is envisaged. Ultimately, it has to be the choice of the parent. Nobody is going to force a parent to place a child in any particular provision but, in extremis, we could all conceive of circumstances where failure to do that would not be a good cause under the provisions.</p>

Following a decision by the local adviser, it would go to a decision maker who is an EO, or even an HEO, and, if necessary, beyond that. If the lone parent felt there was good cause, then I am confident that even if, for some reason, an unreasonable decision had been made by the local job adviser, there is plenty of opportunity to review it and, I hope, correct it.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000004"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="090609152000183"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My noble friend is exactly right. Sanctions are appealable and before that stage there is an opportunity to revisit the conditionality imposed on someone.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000005"></a>There can be no absolute guarantee that parents will be able to access exactly the childcare they need at the point they need it, and a judgment about predictability of service is almost impossible to make. Therefore, while I entirely sympathise with the amendment, its effect would be completely to neutralise the new provisions in the case of those with children. Rather than deal with the issues as the amendment proposes, we will use regulation-making powers to introduce provision that mirrors that which we introduced to support the new lone parent obligations introduced last November.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000006"></a>These regulations deal with decisions on good cause, as I just outlined, for any act or omission on behalf of the claimant in relation to certain jobseeking obligations, such as non-compliance with a jobseekers direction or failure to take up a suitable offer of employment.

This will ensure that JSA claimants who are parents, including lone parents, will not be sanctioned if they fail to participate in &#147;work for your benefit&#148; or work-related activities because they cannot secure appropriate childcare. The availability of childcare is an important consideration for many of our clients who are seeking a return to work, not just those required to participate in schemes under Clauses 1 and 2. We understand that, and we will ensure that the safeguards already in place will be replicated for these new programmes.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000007"></a>Amendment 5 requires jobseekers to participate in &#147;work for your benefit&#148; schemes with a view to improving their prospects of obtaining employment,</p>
<ul><a name="090609152000169"></a>&#147;with guaranteed and predictable access to high quality, flexible and affordable childcare acceptable to the parent and child&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090609152000144"></a>The principle that we will adopt here, as we do in other areas of welfare-to-work provision, is to allow parents to source from the childcare market the provision that suits their particular needs. In some cases, this childcare is provided by employers, for example, through workplace crches, but in the vast majority of cases it is not. We will continue to adopt the principle of allowing parents to source appropriate provision as this offers them the widest possible choice. This will, of course, be underpinned by the safeguards I have just outlined relating to good cause for failure to participate, ultimately through an appeals route, as my noble friend said.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000008"></a>I shall pick up some of the individual points. We will not make people work for their benefit if there is no childcare to support them. Safeguards exist so that customers will not be sanctioned if lack of appropriate childcare prevents them participating in &#147;work for your benefit&#148;. I want to make that absolutely clear. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked why we do not wait until we have completed the wraparound childcare and it is in place. According to our information, the availability of childcare places has more than doubled since 1997. The Childcare Act 2006 places a duty on local authorities in England and Wales, and we believe that the Scottish Government&#146;s published objective to support access to employment and training through the provision of flexible, accessible, affordable childcare will continue to improve coverage over time. If that belief is misplaced, which is the thrust of some of the comments that have been made, there cannot be consequences for the lone parent in terms of conditionality, directions or, ultimately, sanctions, to be imposed upon them.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000009"></a>A number of noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Kirkwood, referred to the Childcare Act not applying in Scotland. Of course, we have yet to decide where the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; pilots will be. However, the Scottish Government recently published a document entitled <I>The Early Years Framework</I>, which includes a key objective of ensuring that parents in Scotland are supported in accessing employment and training to help to reduce the risks of child poverty, including through the provision of flexible, accessible and affordable childcare.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000010"></a>A number of comments were made about the current extent of provision in the UK. My data say that we have over 3,000 children centres in England and are on target for 3,500 next year. I have visited some as well&#151;I do not remember how many we have in Luton, but about three of them. There is a robust plan to have a couple of dozen, maybe more, and these are fantastic facilities that are really making a difference to people&#146;s lives. Seventeen per cent of primary schools and 79 per cent of secondary schools are already offering a core extended service for childcare and support.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000011"></a>On contracted-out provision, our contract specifications will make clear that decisions on the type of support and work experience undertaken must be taken in consultation with the client and not in spite of them. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, talked about the balance of power in the relationships. We want the Gregg vision of co-ownership, and directions backed up by sanctions are for hard cases. All the evidence we have shows that they are necessary. However, I can guarantee that there will be no conditionality where there is no childcare acceptable to the parent.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000012"></a>On the quantity of provision available, for August 2008, taking into account turnover, over 664,000 new Ofsted-registered childcare places, net, have been created since 1997. At that date, the stock of registered childcare stood at over 1.3 million places&#151;more than double the 1997 level. Registered places are being delivered by 89,000 childcare providers, including around 64,000 child-minders. In 1997, there was a registered childcare place for one in eight children under eight, whereas now there is a registered place for one in four. There are 12,000 out-of-school clubs. There is extensive provision&#151;</p>

I understand that the average cost is below the maximum that is provided under the tax credit rules.

The extent of the pathfinders has not yet been determined and until they have been structured and identified, the extent that there may need to be childcare support cannot be calculated.</p>

I think I am right in saying that in the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; pathfinders, the provision is &#163;20 million. Obviously, that figure covers all the components.

How that sum is deployed will depend upon how the pathfinders are designed, which areas they are in, what the level of provision will be, what the cost of provision will be and what bids will come from providers in terms of their costs. Until we have gone through that, I cannot split that figure down in further detail. We are right at the start of the process of designing these pathfinders along with stakeholders. Doubtless, as these things develop, we will be better able to give some specifics on the point the noble Lord is probing.</p>

In other words, I did not want to know that &#163;1 million of the &#163;20 million on the original pathfinders was likely to be spent on childcare. I was asking whether the &#163;20 million includes an amount, let us call it X, for childcare. That was what I was trying to pin down.</p>

I think that only until I think about it a little more. It seems to me that if what he said is true, it takes away my complaint about the prospective inadequacy of the services come 2010. Is he saying that the provisions we are putting into legislation allow that when the facts of the individual case are established in relation to childcare and the parent is acting reasonably, parents have the ability to say no to jobseeker&#146;s directions or any element of their jobseeker&#146;s action plan for the foreseeable future? Is the Minister saying that the power is in the Bill and it is in the Government's mind that that should be the normal run of the mill? There are always exceptions because there are infinite varieties of family circumstances and they change all the time. Is the Minister saying that the power resides with the parent to say that the facts are agreed and it is not in the family&#146;s best interests and that the parent will be allowed to leave aside any further activity provided for under jobseeker&#146;s allowance? If that is what he said, that is massively helpful. I am not trying to be clever here; I am just trying to understand. If that is not right, perhaps he will write to us because people will be watching this very carefully. If that assurance that I have just tried to describe as accurately as I can stands, we can move on because the situation becomes a lot clearer and an awful lot better.</p>

If there is not appropriate and affordable childcare, that should be reflected in the jobseeker&#146;s agreement. If there were to be any suggestion of sanctions that flowed from directions, in looking at good cause, no sanctions could be levied on the individual if there was no appropriate and affordable childcare or appropriate transport. That is the clear intent. I think that the noble Lord was trying to press me a little further. Notwithstanding the fact that there may be a range of good quality, affordable childcare, if a parent says, &#147;I do not want to avail myself of any of that. I do not think that that is something I want to do&#148;, would that lead an individual to the same position? The answer is that it probably would not. We should hang on to the point that you could see circumstances where someone would simply point-blank refuse access to any decent, available provision and thereby escape the regime. We do not intend that to happen.</p>

If there is childcare across the road and a parent says, &#147;I don&#146;t care. I am going nowhere&#148;, that would be acting unreasonably. I was very careful about that. It comes down to what is the provision and who agrees whether or not it is fair. This is a really important point: it is the parent who judges the reasonableness. It is the parent who says prima facie, &#147;That is unreasonable for me. It is my child and my future&#148;. If they are acting unreasonably, that is understood and no one would want to give them a blanket exemption just by pleading inadequate childcare, flying in the face of the circumstances that obtain at the time.</p>

Are we still eliding the distinction between progress to work and employment? Where we are dealing with employment, we are dealing with children whose youngest age is seven. Therefore, they would fall within the school day. It may well be that the child is tired and does not want to stay on for an elongated day and so on. That seems to be very different from issues about childminders et cetera. Where you are talking about progress to work and a child aged between three and seven, we know that at the age of three the child is able to go into part-time nursery school. I know of no parents who refuse that offer. They are delighted that their child is making that step.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000035"></a>We might need assurance from my noble friend that the regime of progress to work and the amount of activity it engenders is such that it can be perfectly reasonably done within that sort of part-time care provided by nursery schools, kindergartens and so on from the age of three, of which every parent I know is delighted to take advantage. It becomes oppressive or unreasonable only when you have to find additional care beyond that, with which the parent is uncomfortable because they feel that it is inappropriate for their child. That does not seem to be necessarily the situation with progress to work.</p>

I disagree for the reasons in the Gregg report. Gregg says that the categories, or the arbitrary ages of seven, 10, two or three, do not matter. It is about the family circumstances. Through my work with the Wise Group, I have seen parents who, having given birth, want to go straight back to work. In their circumstances, it is right for them. There is an idea that you should categorise people and set up circumstances depending on what kind of client group they are in or what box they tick. We should be moving towards, which we will come to in the next amendment, a system so professionally supported that people will want it. The noble Baroness made the point about giving bonuses. It is about all of that.</p>

I think the noble Lord would accept that. From my experience, every lone parent who is anxious to go back to work, as has been said and as Gregg would encourage&#151;I absolutely agree with that&#151;has nearly always got their childcare sorted, or, if not, they are up to the last point of getting it. Once you have got to that point, it really is easy.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000039"></a>The problem is those parents who, often because of misdiagnosed ill-health, moderate depression, lack of skills, lack of self-confidence, feeling battered or low self-esteem, cannot even get the energy going to get into the progress-to-work activity. That, over and beyond poverty, overshadows, very often to awful effect, the quality of life of their children. That is why I asked my noble friend much earlier on for examples of what this would look like. This progress-to-work activity must be a comfortable fit for what the parent with care for fairly small children can manage in the hours during which the child is likely to go to school. Beyond that, it becomes oppressive. A lot of the Gregg report is not terribly relevant because the Bill has gone beyond that; it has gone in different directions from that.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000040"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090609152000206"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I will pick up on a couple of points that have been made. My noble friend is absolutely right to draw a distinction between the progress-to-work group of provisions and the nature and length of engagement that they are likely to require at any point. The expectation is that that could generally, as I think I said earlier, be accomplished under the arrangements that a parent already had. There is a distinction to be drawn between them and the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; group of provisions in Clause 1 because there is typically a requirement to engage for possibly 40 hours a week, 10 of which are focused on job search and employment support, although if someone&#146;s jobseeker&#146;s agreement has already established that they should not be available for work or seek to work for more than, say, 20 hours, that would be carried through into the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; rules.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000041"></a>I shall now get back to the very reasonable point on which the noble Lord pressed me earlier. The best way in which to approach it is to say that the parent is in the driving seat and will decide what is suitable for their child. Ultimately, however, when it comes to deciding whether a direction was reasonable or whether a person had good cause not to follow it, clearly the decision-makers in Jobcentre Plus have to take a view on what was reasonable in those circumstances. Nothing in all this requires parents to be directed to place their child with any particular provision, although consequences may flow from that. I hope that that helps. I have forgotten where we are and whose amendment this is.</p>

There is a rate for one child and a rate for two or more children. That is the rate that we would use. If there is more than one child, they are not necessarily at the same school, so again issues such as the timing of the arrangements and transport costs would have to reflect the circumstances of the family as a whole.</p>

It flows from what the noble Countess has just said. If the cost of childcare for four children plus transport is more than the net amount which will be derived from the employment, can a parent still be forced to take that option?</p>

<p><a name="090609152000047"></a>I do not care how we get there, but this policy is dependent on the decision made between the parent and the personal adviser. If the Minister is saying that the parent is in the driving seat, I am prepared to settle for that. I do not think that the wording of the policy in cold print makes that clear and I do not know whether there is any scope for trying to clarify it. It might be difficult. People may think I am nave, but I am reassured by what I have been told. Later we shall be able to look at this very carefully on other amendments tabled by colleagues which will give us time to reflect, which I will appreciate. I believe that the Minister is trying to get to the right place, but I am not sure we are there yet. The question is what is reasonable about the circumstances applying factually in each case? I shall settle for what I have, regroup and get ready to fight another day, unless further inspiration is appearing over the Minister's left shoulder.</p>

You can see what is written at the moment and how it is employed in practice. Perhaps I can ensure I have this absolutely right. For the progression-to-work group, Jobcentre Plus will pay for childcare and not the tax credit system. The tax credit system sets the parameters of the amount and we are tapping into those limits. I hope that is sufficient comfort, although I accept that the noble Lord will wish to reflect on the matter.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000153"></a>&#147;Regulations may make provision for or in connection with imposing on claimants in prescribed circumstances a requirement to participate in schemes of any prescribed description that are personally tailored to assist them to obtain employment&#148;.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000051"></a>The purpose of the amendment is simple. It is to ensure that claimants would be required only to undertake &#147;work for your benefit&#148; schemes that were personally tailored to assist them to obtain employment, and would not be expected to take part in any old scheme, however unsuitable. The Minister will, I am sure, say that the word &#147;designed&#148; does the same thing, but it is in reality a long way from &#147;personally tailored&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000052"></a>In the other place, the then Minister&#151;various Ministers have gone in the other place&#151;stated that appropriate safeguards would be incorporated, presumably in regulations, to ensure that the work experience offered was suitable and relevant to an individual&#146;s circumstances. In which case, why not put this undertaking in the Bill to allay the fears of many people that claimants will be placed in inappropriate, one-size-fits-all &#147;work for your benefit&#148; schemes? If we are to have this approach, we need to make sure that it will really help someone find a suitable job, and is not going to be looked on as some kind of punishment. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000054"></a>The noble Baroness has tabled an amendment which could have sparked off a very large debate, but the amendment seems to be more of a probe. I expect that this is a theme to which we will return more than once in our deliberations. The amendment seeks to ensure that claimants would be required only to undertake &#147;work for your benefit&#148; schemes that are personally tailored to their needs, rather than, as the noble Baroness said, one-size-fits-all schemes, which may not be suitable or effective. She is concerned that the Government&#146;s claims for providing high-quality, personally tailored employment and skills to support claimants is not backed up by any precise wording in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000055"></a>The noble Baroness is worried that, as currently worded, the Bill would allow for claimants to be required to participate in &#147;work for your benefit&#148; schemes that are simply &#147;designed&#148;, but not apparently designed for anything much in particular. This raises

Can the Minister be any more specific about the design of the scheme? We know from our bumper information pack that personal advisers will be on hand to offer, we are told, carefully tailored advice and support to participants. This is, of course, subject to all sorts of questions which I and other noble Lords will raise in our debates. I am thinking not least of the training which will be given to Jobcentre Plus staff for providing a personally tailored service.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000056"></a>I expect that the Minister will have full responses to all our concerns, as and when they are raised in the coming days. It will be through careful examination of all the Government&#146;s proposals, rather than hearing a warm assurance of good intentions from the Minister&#151;welcome though that may be&#151;that Members of the Committee will be able to determine whether the service that has been &#147;designed&#148; really has been personally tailored.</p>

We need to have a cost-benefit analysis of tailoring. How much does it cost to prepare a home-based woman from a minority, who is not familiar with the English language, and who has not had an English education to become available for work? What kind of work does she get that would pay for the care of two or three children? Unless and until we have sensitivity to different cultures and minorities we will be unable to cope with this problem in, for example, Bradford. Unfortunately, with the notable exception of this House, I have not seen Muslim women in positions of decision-making in sufficient numbers. I am interested in finding out how much it costs to train culturally sensitive people who are not on the scene now as far as we can see, and what the cost benefits would be in getting a woman who is providing good care of her children to become a lowly paid charlady and then paying for her children to be cared for. I am sure that it would be very good for her children, but what would it do for the family and for the woman?</p>

In those days, we had designed benefits. Everything was two pounds and 10 shillings a week. We only had five benefits and we did not deal with unemployment benefit. The progress that has been made since then is admirable, but we need to take care with how we deal with the people for whom we are trying to find employment. Every individual is different and they all have different needs. I am thinking of people who may not be very well but who want to work just the same. I am thinking of people who do not have the language but want to work just the same. We need staff who are trained to be able to cope with those sorts of things. The difficulty again arises with how we can split those staff, because different people

We return to the cost benefit of this and I am concerned that it has not been thought through completely.</p>

It goes to the heart of whether the department is in a position to get this significant change of policy across. In the 2009 staff survey, which enjoyed the attention of 73,000 people in the department who responded, only a minority of the staff think that the department is well managed and that its executive team has a clear vision for the future. There are a lot of interesting statistics here, one or two of which I will offer the Committee for consideration because they feed into the capacity and morale of the department that will take forward the rollout of this programme.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000061"></a>Only 28 per cent agreed with the statement:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000154"></a>&#147;I believe the DWP Executive Team has a clear vision for the future of DWP&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000145"></a>The survey went on to talk about resources, with 43 per cent of respondents agreeing that there are usually sufficient people in their units, so there are some staff capacity issues there. Finally&#151;and this is only one of a selection with which I could entertain the Committee with song and dance for some time&#151;33 per cent of staff disagreed or strongly disagreed that their part of the DWP is committed to delivering a quality customer service and less than half agreed that it acted on feedback received from customers.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000062"></a>That is a very comprehensive survey and I selected those statistics rather carefully, but I wanted to add to what has been said. Unless the department is really up to the mark, and professional training, resources, capacity and morale are clearly in place for 2010, we risk this policy failing. The Government have a lot of work to do in trying to make sure that this can be delivered properly and with confidence.</p>

I find it difficult to understand the line of the Conservative Bench, because they do not seem to be in favour of the amendment, which describes entirely what we are trying to achieve and puts it very clearly. I am taking no account of those criticisms which were produced by a spy, apparently, in the department. This is a sensible way of outlining the care that will be needed in working out these plans, which I would have thought the whole Bill was trying to achieve. I support the amendment.</p>

Jobcentre Plus in particular is under enormous pressure, given the volumes that it copes with, and in my view is doing fantastically well. It is still meeting the targets that were set for its operations in an environment that was much more

As we debated in the Budget this year and the PBR last year, considerable additional resources were made available to Jobcentre Plus so that it could address the issues and programmes for which it was put in place. I know that the noble Lord goes on visits around the country, but in my visits to Jobcentre Plus I have seen the incredible dedication and commitment of the staff who have been involved in changes to the processes around JSA in particular. They have avidly awaited those coming on stream so that they could give more support and help more quickly to their customers. I found it truly impressive. Snapshots of staff surveys have a role, but I suggest that we need to see the wider context.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000065"></a>The amendment seeks to enshrine in legislation that the support offered by &#147;work for your benefit&#148; must be &#147;personally tailored&#148;. I agree that this is the type of support that we want providers to offer customers, but I do not think it appropriate to specify that in primary legislation in the way that the noble Baroness suggests. All welfare-to-work programmes are designed to help people obtain work, irrespective of their personal circumstances. I readily accept the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, that some individuals&#146; circumstances are very challenging and a lot of support should quite properly go to meet their needs. It is the nature of the support offered that is personally tailored to an individual, not the principle of the programme. What should be tailored is the personal support to an individual, whereas the programme itself may in some circumstances be a more general programme.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000066"></a>As drafted, the amendment would require us to design separate programmes for each customer, rather than provide tailored support in a single programme. In &#147;work for your benefit&#148; we plan to have an overarching design that specifies the broad level of work experience required of customers and the level of employment support we expect them to receive. We will then ask providers to source individually tailored work experience placements and deliver additional support that is specific to each jobseeker&#146;s barriers to work. The procurement approach we will take will be similar to that taken with the Flexible New Deal where we specified that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000155"></a>&#147;Suppliers will deliver work-focused support, tailored to each individual&#146;s needs and consistent with local labour market requirements&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000146"></a>Crucially:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000156"></a>&#147;Every customer, including those with more substantial needs, will receive a level of support appropriate to their level of need&#148;.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000067"></a>Using contracting rather than the legislative approach gives us the flexibility we require to respond to changing market and economic conditions without resorting to further primary legislation. I hope the noble Baroness will be convinced that that is the right approach and one that we have used successfully up to now.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000068"></a>In terms of resources and capacity, before we undertake any new programme, the department examines its operational readiness to implement it and we plan to pilot the programme to see if it is successful in helping people find work. Through our evaluation, we will also be able to ascertain the experience of Jobcentre Plus in referring customers to the programme. The noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, asked whether it would cost too much to support some people as they need to  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC76"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be supported. Providers&#146; costs will be balanced. Some people will cost more to support and some will cost less, but we are clear that providers must address each individual&#146;s barriers, whatever they are.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000069"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0006.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="090609152000223"></a>Baroness Afshar:</b> It was earlier stated that for every &#163;1 spent, &#163;1.50 is saved. Adding all those 50-pences together hardly pays for even one person to be trained. I am therefore a little worried about the optimism that it will be possible.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000070"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0006.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="090609152000224"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I think that the ratio of &#163;1 invested to &#163;1.50 returned is saying that you can recover all your costs and, in a sense, be in profit, although I do not like to use that terminology in this context. That is a broad issue around the spectrum of our programmes.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000071"></a>Perhaps I may deal with a couple of other points. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, said that &#147;work for your benefit&#148; schemes should not be seen as a punishment. It is not about punishment but about ensuring that the long-term unemployed have opportunities to develop work habits and experience that will stand them in good stead as they move closer to work.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000072"></a>The noble Countess, Lady Mar, referred to the cost-benefit of helping the harder to help. I stress that we do not want to write anyone off, and it would be wrong to tell someone that they cannot participate because their circumstances are deemed to be too difficult. That is an absolutely fundamental part of our approach.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000073"></a>I hope the noble Baroness will accept that framing the amendment in this way is not particularly appropriate, although I do not think that we are apart on what we want to achieve, which is an individually supported approach.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000074"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0006.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="090609152000225"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> I suppose that there are limits to the analogy of tailoring, but I can see circumstances in which someone&#146;s situation is sufficiently of a regular fit for there to be an off-the-peg solution to their problem. There are dangers in that, however. I am thinking of the Paul Whitehouse character in the television programme who convinces the person in the ill-fitting suit that it &#147;Suits you, sir&#148;. I hope the Minister will understand that while it is understandable that there will be patterns that are capable of being resolved by reciprocal patterns, there are also individual cases that are extremely complex and will require considerable focus and invention to get the right solution for that individual. I hope that nothing that the noble Lord is proposing in this legislation removes that from the facility that will be available for people.</p>

Imagine a ladder, if you like. The person who is anxious to get back into work is on, say, step nine of a 10-rung ladder. Some people are only on step one or two, and in no cost-benefit analysis can it ever be worth us investing in them to get back to work.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000076"></a>However, the alternative is to write them off, as my noble friend said. That is also unacceptable. I suggest, and I hope, that this would come home clearly if we could see what some of the progress-to-work patterns would look like, because at the end of progress-to-work I am quite sure that there will be a minority&#151;I hope a tiny minority&#151;who will never engage, as we would understand it, in the wage labour market. The process of engagement, possibly by doing some voluntary work, by being encouraged to settle and sort out their housing situation, and by getting some of their debt under control, means that none the less they will be better parents and that they and the child will enjoy a better quality of life, and a richer one, even if the final outcome is not what we would want. We may have to accept that for all sorts of reasons, including poor mental health, some people may remain a long way from the labour market. Investment in them and their personal skills will surely have repercussions over and beyond a narrower version of a cost-benefit analysis of a return to work.</p>

I want to be clear about the definition of &#147;work for your benefit&#148;. They are people who are work-ready, but as my noble friend Lady Hollis has said, &#147;work-ready&#148; might mean they still have quite a long way to go. We probably need to distinguish them from people who have limited capability for work and who would access employment and support allowance where progression-to-work might apply but not &#147;work for your benefit&#148;.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000078"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said that we cannot have an off-the-peg solution for everyone. That is absolutely right, but there is a distinction between having a programme that might apply to several people and ensuring that the support is specifically focused on an individual&#146;s needs rather than analysing the needs of that individual and always tailoring a specific programme to meet those needs. I do not think that is necessarily required. That is the distinction we are trying to reach.</p>

I must warn the Committee that I have another amendment that is exactly the same; it is about claimants of ESA and income support and partners of claimants of those on JSA and ESA.

I have five small, probing amendments. As the Minister will remember me saying, and as is my wont, if I do not understand the Bill, how on earth will we get to Report stage with any degree of alacrity?</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000083"></a>The amendment is the first of many, but it has a double purpose, one of which is to do something which the Minister is sometimes resistant to: that is, being pinned down, as he explained in an outburst half an hour or so ago. New Section 17A(2) to the Jobseekers Act 1995 is the second of 387 references to regulations in the Bill. The purpose of these regulations is to require participants to undertake certain activities in order to improve their prospects of getting a job. That covers an initial interview, at which it is decided what would comprise the steps needed to meet that objective.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000084"></a>My second amendment would require the lone parent to undertake certain activities to improve their prospects of getting a job. This would cover an initial interview at which it was decided what would comprise the steps that were needed. This amendment to line 16 of page 1 seeks to discover exactly why and where work comes into the whole scheme of things. I understand that it is absolutely essential to have this progression and the work-related activity to get there, but surely work in itself is work-related. Therefore, why do we need the word &#147;work&#148; in this subsection?</p>

<p><a name="090609152000085"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="090609152000233"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> We agree that blurring work and work-related activity is very confusing. I think this was the noble Lord&#146;s point. &#147;Work for your benefit&#148; is a tough slogan, whereas &#147;work-related activity for your benefit&#148; does not work nearly so well. If this is what is meant, we should know this. In the Peers&#146; information pack about the Bill, we see the sentence:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000158"></a>&#147;Customers will be required to take part in full-time activity for up to 6 months&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000147"></a>Full-time activity is a new phrase. It would be nice to know what it means.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000086"></a>It might be the right time to bring up another matter. Will the Minister answer a question that I asked at Second Reading? Will he say whether a claimant could be required to work full-time for six months at the JSA rate? I did not receive an answer from him at that point, but it would be useful to know whether that could happen or was very unlikely to

While we are on this subject, the Peers&#146; information pack raises another matter: personal advisers are to be allowed the flexibility to refer claimants earlier than at the two-year point if they feel that this would be beneficial for the claimant. I assume that these claimants will be in the pilot areas only. Will this be by mutual agreement, or will the adviser be able to issue a direction? The department seems to be moving the goal-posts at will, which makes scrutiny rather difficult.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000087"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="090609152000234"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Clause 1 is specifically about making provision for &#147;work for your benefit&#148;. &#147;Work for your benefit&#148; will be a significant increase in the support that we offer and the activity that we require long-term jobseekers to undertake; namely, up to six months of full-time work experience. This clause is designed to ensure that there is no doubt about our ability to require this of jobseekers.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000088"></a>The amendment would, on the other hand, leave considerable room for misunderstanding about the scope of the powers in this clause: for example, whether full-time work experience is actually work-related activity or work. That kind of ambiguity cannot be good for anyone. It is certainly not good for what we seek to achieve here. However, given the nervousness about the use of &#147;work&#148;, it might be useful to put on the record exactly what we intend for &#147;work for your benefit&#148;. I hope that this will offer some reassurance.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000089"></a>Participants will be expected to do full-time work experience&#151;that is, up to 30 hours a week&#151;but it could be less if the claimant has caring responsibilities, for example. This will be backed up with up to 10 additional hours per week of wider employment support to help claimants to capitalise on the experiences that they are gaining. The work experience will not be one-size-fits-all. Placements will be sourced by providers on an individual basis based on the needs of the claimant and we will expect providers to support claimants in those placements. We will not specify what type of work experience the claimant must do, nor will it need to be in any particular sector. It will depend entirely on the aspirations of the claimant and their barriers to work. This does not provide any easy answers when people ask what type of work people will be doing, but it is entirely the right approach.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000090"></a>In this clause we could specify to our hearts content what we expect of participants, but in the end it would do nothing more than restrict the innovation and creativity of providers and guarantee that someone, somewhere would be unable to do the kind of work experience they need to. I hope that this gives some reassurance that there is no need for this amendment. In using the word &#147;work&#148;, the text is intended to make clear that participants will be required to undertake work-related activity that is different or more intensive from that in which they have previously participated; namely, full-time work experience over a period of up to six months.</p>

It would not all have to be work experience in terms of a placement at a particular operation.

One of the big differences between how the programme is applied in the US and what we envisage here is that the work experience needs to be accompanied by support for actively seeking employment and employment support along the way. It is not at all about dumping someone on an employer and not having these other components. Research from international programmes has shown that if you do not have those other components, you are much less likely to be successful. I hope that that will satisfy the noble Countess. So it is 30 hours work experience plus 10 hours for job search. I hope that that has helped the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I take the point that the Minister has just made about the split between the 30 hours and 10 hours in his illustration. None the less, I am not quite clear how this works.

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000097"></a>Some time ago, I received some correspondence that caused me to ponder the subject of part-time work vis- -vis the Bill. A letter I received is particularly telling and went something like this:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000160"></a>&#147;I have obsessive-compulsive disorder in the form of a washing obsession. This is a disorder that affects one in 100 people and is listed among the 10 most debilitating illnesses in terms of loss of income by the World Health Organisation.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000161"></a>I have an illness which means that I cannot work nine to five. I am unable to work set hours and days every week, even part time. I tried and failed. My only option is to find freelance work that allows me to fit work around my washing and other obsessions.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000162"></a>However, the Government&#146;s reforms involve rolling out a programme called Pathways to Work, a programme that, in practice, regardless of what they say, is only for people who can work a set amount of hours per week on a permanent basis. I have already been sent on this programme and turned away because my illness does not fit this box.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000163"></a>There is no help and no advice available at my Jobcentre Plus for people looking to do freelance work. There is literally zero advice available on the topic or support for coming off benefits while attempting to do freelance work. The Government says that you can get the support and advice from Pathways, but I have found that this is not the case in practice. They are paid for each person they get into employment, and as it would take several months of quite intensive support to help me, it is not worth their while, I suppose.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000164"></a>In addition, permitted working hours/amounts make it impossible to try to get freelance work. They state you can&#146;t earn more than &#163;20 a week. Actually, it took over a year to discover it&#146;s possible to average out weekly earnings over a period of time, but nobody volunteers this information or supports you to do this work. The permitted work earnings of &#163;92 a week do not apply unless you are doing that every week for 52 weeks, which I wouldn&#146;t be because I would have to be finding and building up work slowly. However, if I did briefly go over the &#163;20 limit, I would automatically fall into the &#163;92 a week group, and so, after 52 weeks, be forced to give up all benefits or give up work.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090609152000165"></a>Supported permitted work rules (that also allow &#163;92 a week) don&#146;t apply either because my mental health team don&#146;t want me to do paid work, only voluntary work, and won&#146;t support me to do freelance work. The rules don&#146;t seem to apply to freelance work, and you have little say in recovery&#148;.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000098"></a>What a horrendous tale of bad operation in Pathways to Work from a person who is trying desperately to get into work through the part-time or freelance avenue and does not appear to be allowed to do so at the moment. What do the Government intend to do within the context of the Bill to help people like this? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000099"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0007.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="090609152000242"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I listened to the example given by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. It is difficult to respond in detail without having the chance to review the facts, but I am happy to take the specifics back to the department. From what he said, it seems that the Pathways to Work programme was involved. It is part of the employment and support allowance for incapacity benefit, not part of the JSA route, and therefore Clause 1 provisions about &#147;work for your benefit&#148; would not apply in those circumstances. Clause 1 is before us and is the subject of the amendment. Whether the individual is correctly based on ESA or not depends, as we have discussed on the Welfare Reform Bill, on the work capability assessment and  


<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC82"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column GC82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what flows from that. If the noble Lord would kindly send me the details of the case, I will have it looked at by officials, if he wishes. However, I suggest it is a separate issue from what Clause 1 focuses on, which is people who are subject to full conditionality under the JSA regime and the proposed amendment to that, which I shall address briefly in my response.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000100"></a>The amendment would remove an important aspect of the definition of work-related activity as it applies in Clause 1. As currently drafted, work-related activity can mean activity that is designed to get people back to work, but also activity that is designed to improve someone's overall employability. It could, for example, be activity that would bring someone closer to the labour market or improve their chances of retaining employment over the longer term. It could also mean activity designed to allow someone to progress in work when they have found a job. The effects may not be immediate.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000101"></a>&#147;Work for your benefit&#148; in particular is primarily about work experience, the positive effects of which will grow with time. For example, we expect that &#147;work for your benefit&#148; will allow customers to develop work habits, experience routine and gain knowledge of work environments in ways in which they may not have done for some time, if ever. All of those things may be appropriate for any given claimant at different times. The amendment would therefore restrict the range of support that we may require a claimant to participate in and that is something we resist.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000102"></a>The definition of work-related activity used in Clause 1 is the same as we are currently using in the Welfare Reform Act 2007 and as we use in Clause 2 of the Bill. Accepting the amendment would result in a number of different definitions being used in legislation, which can only confuse the matter. I hope that, with the offer of help on the specific case raised by the noble Lord, he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

They are intended to apply when someone has been away from the labour market for a long time. Typically, in relation to Flexible New Deal, it would be someone who has been through the first year of the Jobcentre Plus stages and then had a year with the New Deal and has still not accessed employment. Those are particularly the people we are seeking to support with this arrangement. However, we are trying to focus this on 40 hours per week, some of which will be work experience and some of which could be a job search and other employment support. An individual who was on JSA prior to entering this programme may, under their job seeker&#146;s agreement, have restricted hours when they have to be available and that would carry through, so a part-time engagement could be what &#147;work for your benefit&#148; produces for them.</p>

It is a framework but we need to ensure that the sorts of regulations which we would want to develop are going to be as supportive as we want for people. We need to ensure that the legislative framework for that is clear. That phrase is there for that reason.</p>

I assume that that will take place at the original interview when the sort of work-related activity will be proposed and, in theory, at least, be agreed. What happens if it is not agreed? A sanction can hardly operate here unless the participant is being unreasonable. It could well be that the personal adviser is promoting a quite inappropriate course of action or it might be that the personal adviser simply does not click with the participant. What does the Minister envisage happening then? Will there be an opportunity to find another personal adviser?</p>

<a name="90609-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000113"></a>Irrespective of those questions, new subsection (5)(b) makes provision within the regulations for a case where a person is not&#151;that is the important word&#151;required to participate in a scheme. Can the Minister give us an example? The subsection goes on to say that there are occasions when the participant is not required to meet certain conditions. Again, I am not quite sure what might occasion that. I hope that the Minister can explain it to us. I beg to move.</p>

People may be required to do up to 40 hours of activity a week for up to six months. We think that that intensive support will be invaluable to people who are long-term unemployed but may, on occasion, make it difficult for some people to fully meet the technical requirements of entitlement to JSA. For example, jobseekers are required to be available to take up employment within 24 hours if necessary. This may be difficult if a participant has to rearrange childcare or transport arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000115"></a>The ability to waive some areas of the entitlement conditions will allow us to take some of these things into account and ensure that the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; programme is not hamstrung by bureaucracy. We would not want to create a situation where a claimant was not able to meet their conditions of entitlement because of something we required them to do. That would be not only absurd, but also deeply unfair. The amendment would remove our ability to make these easements and could result in just such a situation. I can reassure noble Lords that we do not intend to remove all requirements to look for work or to take up employment, which would clearly be counterproductive. This provision is not about excluding people from &#147;work for your benefit&#148;; it is just easing the other job-seeking conditions.</p>

If the individual goes back to Jobcentre Plus, they would go back to stage 3 of the process. There are three stages; the first three months is a self-managed job search, the next three months is a directed job search, and six months after that there is a supported job search. It is stage 3, the supported job search, to which people would go back. That regime involves a range of things, including the jobseeker&#146;s agreement to being reviewed, mandatory referral to skills support for jobseekers who have extra barriers to work, six weeks of weekly signing, and then back to fortnightly signing. Alternatively, they may go back to the Flexible New Deal programme involving external providers. I hope that that puts more flesh on the bones.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000149"></a>I should like an explanation of this, if the Minister could provide it. If the jobseeker&#146;s agreement is suspended, what happens to the jobseeker? I am not talking about going back at the end of the six months to the beginning of stage 3, but a rather different situation. Is he now unemployed again, or is he deemed still to be in his agreement, pending reinstatement? How will this be recorded?

I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="090609152000179"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="090609152000123"></a><b><a name="90609-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="090609152000262"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Lord for this amendment, and indeed for the series of amendments. If it can help to clarify things for the record, it is time well spent. However, the amendment would remove our ability to suspend a jobseeker&#146;s agreement while a jobseeker takes part in &#147;work for your benefit&#148;, which could have a number of peculiar consequences. As noble Lords may know, complying with a jobseeker&#146;s agreement is part of the entitlement conditions for jobseeker&#146;s allowance: that is, if you fail to comply with it, you will no longer be able to claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000124"></a>The jobseeker&#146;s agreement contains not only information on the kind of work that a jobseeker should look for and the hours for which they must be available for work but information on the steps that they must take to get back into work. These can be small steps such as searching the internet every week, or larger ones such as attending the jobcentre daily to look through vacancies. However, given that the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; programme is full-time, it may be unreasonable or actually impossible for jobseekers to undertake these steps in addition to the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; programme.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000125"></a>Indeed, it would be perverse of us to penalise customers for not complying with their jobseeker&#146;s agreement when they cannot comply simply because they are participating in a mandatory employment programme. Therefore, we may in some circumstances wish to suspend the jobseeker&#146;s agreement to avoid this. It does not mean that we will not expect jobseekers to continue to search for work. That is a fundamental part of the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; programme. Nor does it mean that we will not take account of any restrictions in the jobseeker&#146;s agreement on the types of work or availability that have been agreed with Jobcentre Plus. We will honour those agreements, which will be carried into the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; programme.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000126"></a>I hope that that explains to the noble Lord why we need that provision. To be absolutely clear, its suspension would not affect the claimant or ILO unemployment data. It is nothing to do with seeking to manage the statistics, which never enters our head.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000128"></a>The problem with finding an amendment on which to hang a hook for a particular lot of questions is that the Minister falls into the temptation every time of explaining what it would mean if the particular word that I have singled out in the amendment was left out of the Bill. That has nothing to do with this case at all. That is bad luck. I want to know why the word is there.</p>

<p><a name="090609152000129"></a>I did not hear the Minister respond to my question about what will happen during the suspension. I may have missed that answer. If I have, I will get it from <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow.</p>

It depends on someone&#146;s journey into the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; regime, but that will be provided by an external provider, so there will be a point at which the individual moves from a Flexible New Deal programme to the external provider. That will be the relationship. It will be the external provider&#146;s role to work with the individual to organise the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; scheme and everything that flows from it, but the individual will still be entitled, as I said, to claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance. They are still in the claimant count. Nothing changes there. The jobseeker&#146;s agreement is a crucial part of the process, because compliance with that agreement is a condition of being able to claim the benefit.</p>

But&#151;to my mind it is a big &#147;but&#148;&#151;is this not a repetition of paragraph (e)? Paragraph (e) makes it clear that the regulations will contain those matters which are, and which are not, sanctionable. That paragraph explains what constitutes &#147;good cause&#148; to fail,</p>
<ul><a name="090609152000172"></a>&#147;to comply with the regulations&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="090609152000135"></a>But why is it necessary to have to paragraph (f)?

To my mind that is tautology. I hope that the Minister will be able to straighten me out. I beg to move.</p>

This amendment would, in practice, cast doubt on the Secretary of State&#146;s power to prescribe circumstances in which a customer automatically has, or does not have, good cause for failing in their responsibility to take part in the &#147;work for your benefit&#148; scheme. I know that this is a probing amendment. In the area of sanctions, where a claimant could lose their benefit, it is essential that we ensure there is consistency in decision making. To do otherwise would risk unfairness and inequality. Therefore, the ability to make these regulations is essential. However, it may be helpful if I take this opportunity to set out in a little detail the principle of good cause and how we propose it will operate with regard to &#147;work for your benefit&#148;.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000137"></a>Benefit sanctions are designed to provide incentives for jobseekers to engage with the back-to-work support we offer, although there are some perfectly good reasons why claimants may not be able to meet certain requirements at particular times. In these circumstances, customers are deemed to have good cause for not complying with regulations. This is a safeguard built into the system to avoid customers being unfairly sanctioned. In &#147;work for your benefit&#148;, we plan to adopt the same approach to good cause as existing employment programmes. This ensures that flexibility within the system to deal with individual circumstances exists. Using secondary legislation to prescribe certain circumstances will give us the right level of consistency, but also flexibility to ensure each customer&#146;s case is considered on its merits. In &#147;work for your benefit&#148;, as with other employment programmes, Jobcentre Plus decision-makers will always assess all available evidence when making good-cause decisions.</p>

<a name="90609-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090609152000138"></a>I trust that that gives the detail the noble Lord seeks on why we need that provision. The noble Lord was particularly probing the difference between paragraphs (e) and (f). Paragraph (e) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="090609152000173"></a>&#147;prescribing matters which are, or are not, to be taken into account&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="090609152000151"></a>and paragraph (f) refers to &#147;prescribing circumstances&#148;. The difference is that &#147;matters&#148; relates to the extraneous events that affect the ability to take part. We see &#147;circumstances&#148; as being more personal to the claimant&#151;for example, their health. This distinction is found elsewhere in social security legislation. I hope that that reassures the noble Lord on why we need each of those provisions.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="09061012000007"></a><b><a name="90609-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09061012000033"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Gerry Sutcliffe) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90609-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09061012000008"></a>I have had a number of discussions with the gambling industry in which they have now assured me that they will provide &#163;5 million each year as a minimum commitment over the next three years to fund gambling research, education and treatment. The chair and trustees of the industry fundraising body (the Responsibility in Gambling Trust&#151;RIGT) working with Business in Sport and Leisure (BISL) and the other trade bodies are publicly committed to over-achieving the minimum sum of &#163;15 million over three years and have set out credible plans to do so. They have secured significant corporate backing already.</p>

<a name="90609-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09061012000009"></a>The trustees of the new commissioning body&#151;the Responsible Gambling Fund (RGF)&#151;are satisfied that the assurances given to them by the trustees of RIGT are sufficiently robust to allow them to develop three year funding programmes. This will enable RGF and service providers in the field to plan sensibly. I also saw a successful transition to the new structures for underpinning the strengthened voluntary arrangements as critical. I am pleased that there has been an appropriate transfer of undertakings to the new commissioning body and agreement by the fund&#146;s trustees to a shared executive to support both the Strategy Board and the RGF. It is my and the Strategy Board&#146;s firm expectation that the new shared chief executive role will be advertised shortly and the post filled by the autumn.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS30"></a><b>9 Jun 2009 : Column WS30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90609-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09061012000010"></a>This is not a decision that we have come to lightly. However, on the basis of the assurances provided by the industry and on the funding agreement that has been reached between RIGT and RGF, I have decided to announce that we will not need to introduce a statutory levy.</p>

<a name="90609-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09061012000011"></a>With all three elements in place, the Strategy Board, under the expert chairmanship of Baroness Julia Neuberger, will have the industry commitment and resources to be able to do the job that it was set up to do. I look forward to the board&#146;s initial report in the autumn on what the strategy and priorities should be.</p>

<a name="90609-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09061012000012"></a>We recently completed a consultation on how a statutory levy would be implemented. That consultation made it clear that any levy would take full account of any voluntary payments made up to the point of introduction. I make that point to reassure those who have committed themselves to making the voluntary system work that, if they are let down by less public spirited competitors and I am forced to resurrect the idea of a levy, those who have contributed will benefit from their contributions&#151;not the reverse.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09061012000014"></a>I have today placed copies of the final report of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland on the effectiveness of the Section 75 equality duty in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<a name="90609-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09061012000015"></a>The duty under Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 is an important mechanism for encouraging public authorities to place equality considerations at the heart of policy-making. This report highlights the positive impact that Section 75 has had over the past decade, and offers a helpful reflection on how effectiveness could be developed to encourage greater equality of opportunity for all in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90609-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09061012000025"></a>A key element of the franchise is the delivery of a number of major infrastructure projects including platform lengthening, East London Line and Thameslink. The franchise is drafted in such a way to facilitate the delivery of these projects.</p>

<a name="90609-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09061012000030"></a>New gatelines will be installed at an additional 22 stations on top of the 14 south London stations being gated prior to the franchise commencement with these staffed for longer to increase security and reduce ticketless travel.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_58"></a><a name="09060974000075"></a>In working through the detail for this response, we have identified an element of miscoding whereby other travel costs have been charged to the private car hire expenditure code. The costs in the previous response were therefore overstated by &#163;120,000. This has been adjusted in the figures below.</p>
