<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Mackay of Clashfern): </B>  My Lords, before the commencement of business, I take the opportunity to inform the House that, with the approval of Her Majesty the Queen, I am to visit Sweden at the invitation of the Swedish Speaker between the dates of Friday 8th and Monday 11th December. Accordingly, I trust that the House will agree to grant me leave of absence on Monday 11th December.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Gryfe </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-01_para0"></a>What is their future policy on forestry in view of the failure to achieve new planting targets in both private and public forestry and the planned further disposal of publicly owned woodlands.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office   (The Earl of Lindsay): </B>  My Lords, the two main aims of our policy on forestry continue to be the sustainable management of our existing woods and forests and a steady expansion of tree cover to increase the many diverse benefits that forests provide.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Gryfe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. However, can he give me further assurance regarding the future of the Forestry Commission? Is he aware that the Forestry Commission has now sold off 200,000 hectares of land to private owners? Is he also aware that in very few of those cases are there access agreements, which means that ramblers, hill walkers and others who enjoy the countryside will no longer be able to enjoy the countryside? Secondly, does the reduction in the planting programme of the Forestry Commission in the past five years, from 5,000 hectares per annum to the recent figure of 586 hectares per annum, indicate an intention on the part of the Government to privatise by the back door?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord well knows, the Forestry Commission owns well over a million hectares of ground in the UK. In Scotland, it still controls over 45 per cent. of all woodlands. In respect of those 1 million hectares of ground there is a disposals programme which will last only until the end of the century and which comprises only 1 per cent. of the total estate of the Forestry Commission per annum. Any <P>


<a name="column_882"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 882</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>business of such extraordinary proportions can well do with continuing review and rationalisation. That is all that is happening.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-01_para1"></a>The Government fully appreciate the value of our forests for recreation and access. Therefore we have taken steps to strengthen the arrangements which either maintain or create access when disposals take place. We have a presumption against the sale of any Forestry Commission plots where there are high levels of public access. We encourage local authorities to enter into agreements, and we fund the legal costs of local authorities in meeting those agreements. Woodland access is probably increasing in this country for the first time ever. What is more, it is increasing where it is most needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-01_para2"></a>In relation to planting figures, the noble Lord paints an unnecessarily gloomy picture. The UK leads the way worldwide in increasing forestry cover. We are planting more than 70 million trees per annum. We have met the total planting figure of 33,000 hectares, which comprises new planting and replanting. Since 1979 we have done a great deal to expand the forest cover of Britain.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, in view of the enormous investment which has taken place in the forestry processing industry, is my noble friend worried that the swing to hardwood will result in there not being enough softwood to supply those firms with timber in the years to come?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend raises a good point. The commercial production of timber will remain a fundamental element of government policy. To that end the grants for new conifer planting were increased by nearly 30 per cent. last year where planting takes place on better ground. We expect that increased incentive for coniferous planting to feed through as a major boost to the processing sector. In the past 10 years &#163;1 billion has been invested in the forestry processing sector. That provides many jobs in rural areas. It is important that we protect that investment; we intend to do so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, the Minister referred to legal costs of management access agreements. They are only a small proportion of the costs to the local authorities of the agreements. Are there any guidelines, or is there any way, in which the costs can be controlled? It is apparent from some of the agreements made that the price exacted for access to the forest is out of all proportion to the possible value of that access.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I looked into the question previously in response to a point put to me by the noble Baroness at the time. I continue to believe that in most cases costs for public access in disposed Forestry Commission sites are cheap. They may involve as little as a gate and the maintenance of the safety of a footpath through natural cover. There are 28 access agreements already in place in disposed Forestry Commission woodlands. Another 44 on Forestry Commission properties are due to go to the market. The local authority response has been tremendous regarding our offer of local public access agreements. We shall <P>


<a name="column_883"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 883</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>certainly continue to work with local authorities to consider the best way of ensuring future public access where Forestry Commission sites are being put on the market.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Earl agree that forestry in this country is important in terms of employment, notably in rural areas? Will he say how many people are employed in forestry, both in the public and private sector, compared with 10 years ago?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I shall write to the noble Lord with the exact figures. However, I can underline the fact that some 20,000 people in Scotland alone are employed in forestry. A similar number of jobs depend on the downstream activities which forestry generates. We are acutely conscious that the planting, management, felling and all other stages of forestry create jobs in rural and remote areas. If you maintain families in those areas, you maintain post offices, schools, buses and so forth. Therefore the Government place a very high priority on forestry as an employment creator.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl mentioned sustainable management of woodlands. Can he possibly define "sustainable management" in this instance?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lady for that question. Sustainability involves the wise use of a resource which meets, as far as possible, our own needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. As regards forestry, we want to plant the right types of trees in the right places. I believe that 10 years ago the preoccupation regarding forestry was in terms of quantity and whether we could achieve a specific planting target. Now we know that we must produce quality at the same time. We must not plant the wrong trees on the wrong ground and therefore close off options for future generations.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that preliminary figures from the forestry authority show a significant decline in levels of restocking this year? In the light of that, will he reconsider the 50 per cent. cut in restocking grants?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, the reduction in the restocking grant announced in September last year did not apply to any applications for a restocking grant which had been received previously. Therefore many restocking operations are still taking place at the original rate.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-01_para3"></a>Since most of the storm damaged areas in England resulting from the 1987 hurricane have now been replanted, less replanting is going on for that reason. In Wales, restocking has increased. The fundamental point about restocking is that there is only a finite level of public moneys available to forestry. Given the level of resources that we have, we must ensure that we derive the maximum possible benefit. At the old rate, <P>


<a name="column_884"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 884</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>restocking grants were not seen to be delivering the value for money that was possible through redeployment to planting grants.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for mentioning Wales. Is he aware that forestry is as important in Wales as in Scotland? As a Minister in the Scottish Office, he is replying for the Forestry Commission and others because the Forestry Commission is based in Edinburgh. What arrangements do the Government propose to ensure that the Welsh interest is properly preserved rather than having to write to Edinburgh every time we want something?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew13"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, it is very simple. One of the forestry ministers is the Secretary of State for Wales.

<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Dubs </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What discussions have taken place with the Cyprus Government regarding the proposed demilitarisation of the island as a basis for reaching a settlement.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, the subject of demilitarisation arises regularly in our talks with both communities in Cyprus. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary discussed it with the Cypriot Foreign Minister, Mr. Michaelides, when he was in London on 1st November. Moves to reduce deployment of troops and levels of military equipment on the island can only help to improve the climate for a settlement.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo951205/text/51205-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his Answer. Does he agree that the proposal to demilitarise the island, involving both a significant reduction in armed forces in the area of the republic and also that occupied by the Turkish Army, is the best way forward for reaching a settlement and ending 21 years of military occupation of northern Cyprus by the Turkish army?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, I certainly agree that demilitarisation from both sides will have considerable advantage in the discussions in trying to get the two sides together.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Vivian: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that it has been reported that the Greek Cypriots have recently spent many millions of pounds, representing a large part of their GDP, on new and highly technical weapons systems?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, we are aware of that report. We do not believe that any form of re-arming can be helpful in this situation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, at a time when 60,000 NATO troops are being put into Bosnia--where there are many parallels with Cyprus--in order to prevent people of different religious affiliations from killing one another, would it not be the height of folly to withdraw troops from Cyprus before a political settlement is reached? The certain consequence would be fighting <P>


<a name="column_885"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 885</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>between Greek civilians attempting to repossess their properties in the north after 21 years and the present Turkish occupants who would undoubtedly resist them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, when we talk about demilitarisation, it is demilitarisation on both the Turkish and the Greek Cypriot sides. We are not talking about demilitarisation of UN troops, which hold the sides apart.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Stallard: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister care to enlarge on the constructive proposals for demilitarisation recently put forward by President Clerides of the republic? Can he tell us the response from the occupied part in the north?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, discussions are taking place which are confidential at the moment. We trust that they will be successful, but I should hate to prejudice that by answering the question at this stage.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, as my noble friend said, it is 21 years since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. The island is still divided and occupied. Can the Minister tell the House whether, as one of the guarantor powers, the Government are happy with the progress which has been made on the matter? Perhaps the involvement of the United States will help. Can the Minister also tell the House what the Government expect to be the outcome of the visit by the US presidential envoy this week to Cyprus?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, we work closely with the US to establish a channel for confidential dialogue between the two communities. So far the talks have not been as productive as we would hope. We are doing everything we can and pushing like mad to come to some settlement. As to the results of the meeting this week, we shall have to wait for it to take place.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mowbray and Stourton: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend agree that, despite the blandishments of the noble Baroness and other noble Lords, 21 years ago the Turks suffered a lot of hassle on the part of the Government of Cyprus? I agree that it was an invasion but it was not totally without provocation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that there is anything to be gained from blaming one side or the other. A just, peaceful and lasting settlement requires the free consent of both communities. That cannot be achieved by bullying.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What was the total cost to public funds of successful challenges by judicial review of decisions made by the Home Secretary in the 1994-95 Session of Parliament.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  My Lords, it is only possible to estimate the total cost to the Home Office of all judicial review <P>


<a name="column_886"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 886</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>applications made in the past year. The total cost, which includes Treasury Solicitor's charges, counsel's fees and the time of Home Office lawyers, is thought to be about &#163;2 million. It is not possible to say what proportion of the cost related to successful challenges by judicial review, but the vast majority of applications are judged to be without foundation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, that figure is absolutely scandalous. Is the Minister aware that, despite all the legal advice the Home Secretary is bound to receive from his own legally qualified officials and despite repeated warnings from noble and learned Lords in all parts of your Lordships' House, the Home Secretary gets his head down and bulldozes ahead with legislation which is subsequently overturned in the courts? Is the Minister aware that if the Home Secretary were a local councillor he would be surcharged? What arrangements are being made to surcharge him? He has become an expensive luxury which the taxpayer simply cannot afford.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, so long as it is the right of individuals to challenge the Home Secretary by using the judicial review process, it is important that they should be afforded that right. When they challenge the Home Secretary, it is important that he gives account of himself in the process. The &#163;2 million which I mentioned in my original Answer covers all judicial challenges to my right honourable friend. Over 90 per cent. of the cases are found in his favour. Only 10 cases involving important decisions have resulted in adverse findings since my right honourable friend became Home Secretary.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Rawlinson of Ewell: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that some of the decisions that have been made caused considerable surprise? One, in particular, was the decision to overrule the Home Secretary's refusal to allow Mr. Moon into this country. His organisation was examined by a jury of this country and found to be a political organisation. Is the Minister therefore aware that some people are surprised at certain decisions recently made by judges?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend is absolutely right. I trust that noble Lords believe, as I and millions of others do, that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary was right to exclude the Reverend Moon from the United Kingdom. Indeed, the judge himself declined to find my right honourable friend's decision irrational. However, the judge found him wanting in that an opportunity to make representations had not been given to Mr. Moon.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-02_para0"></a>To continue the point made by my noble and learned friend, it is also worth noting that the judges themselves are not always in agreement. To take the case of criminal injuries compensation, it is noteworthy that of the 10 judges who considered the case, five found in favour of my right honourable friend and five against. The two judges in the Divisional Court found for him, as did one of the three judges in the Court of Appeal <P>


<a name="column_887"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 887</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and two of the five judges in the House of Lords. It is not only the Home Secretary who is challenged: sometimes the judges themselves do not agree.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe: </B>   My Lords, in view of the legal profession's growing awareness of the problem of its fees, will the Minister agree that this is a suitable case where both solicitors and barristers might be encouraged to give their services free?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I believe that that is a question for our friends in the judiciary.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister agree that whether or not we are surprised is fairly irrelevant? What matters is that the separation of powers under the unwritten constitution between the independent judiciary and the Executive should always be maintained. The cost of the percentage of successful challenges affords no cause for legitimate concern.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely right. It is important to put on record that my right honourable friend only uses those powers which are given to him by a sovereign Parliament.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, would it not be good if Her Majesty's Government devoted as much care and detailed attention to the drafting of legislation as Her Majesty's judges do in reviewing some of its consequences?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, that is an important point. Recent changes have made it easier for Parliament to consider legislation; for example, the work of the scrutiny committee which takes place before Bills go into Committee. So the point is important. However, at the end of the day it is for Parliament to decide and for Home Secretaries to use the powers given to them by a sovereign Parliament.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, the Court of Appeal has today allowed the Home Secretary's appeal in the case of John David Pierson. It set aside the decision of the Divisional Court which had quashed the Home Secretary's tariff and accepted that the Home Secretary had been entitled to increase the tariff. How many cases does the Home Secretary win that we never hear about? What is the percentage?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-02_spnew23"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it is welcome news that my right honourable friend was found to be entirely lawful in using his powers, both to set the tariff and to increase it. My right honourable friend wins over 90 per cent. of applications; therefore the cases that he loses are few. Two cases last week were very good examples, among so many, of findings in favour of the Home Secretary. We have heard very little about them. There was enormous publicity and media outcry when Mr. Justice Dyson held the detention of certain asylum seekers to be unlawful but hardly a whisper when the Appeal Court comprehensively overturned that judgment. The truth <P>


<a name="column_888"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 888</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is that when the Home Secretary loses, there is a great wave of publicity. Of the 90 per cent. of cases he wins, there is hardly a whisper.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister agree that the very limited figures she gave--the Treasury Solicitor's charges and so on--are dwarfed by the enormous costs to the taxpayer of the Home Secretary being overturned in his attempt to supplant the criminal injuries compensation scheme agreed by Parliament? What is her estimate of that cost to the taxpayer? Surely it must be tens or even hundreds of millions of pounds.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it is always unfortunate if people suffer such consequences. However, a judicial review system is in place. The Home Secretary gave an account of himself; the judges were not all in agreement about the right of the Home Secretary to act in the way he did; and that was a consequence of it. It is always unfortunate. I gave figures of the occasions--about 10 only--in which this Home Secretary has been found wanting. Over 90 per cent. of challenges to the Home Secretary are unsuccessful.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of National Heritage   (Lord Inglewood): </B>  My Lords, expenditure on museums and galleries funded directly by the Department of National Heritage is planned to be &#163;205.6 million in 1996-97 and &#163;200.5 million in the next two years, compared with the previous planning figure for 1996-97 of &#163;211.6 million.

<A NAME="51205-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, I declare a non-financial interest as a trustee of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Is the Minister aware that I am the first to recognise the need at times to control public expenditure, having done a fair bit of that for over five years? Is he also aware that what may be modest cuts by Treasury standards are catastrophic to the museums and galleries, not least to the Victoria and Albert Museum? The cut in the museum's grant is almost 3 per cent. for 1996-97 and 3.4 per cent. in later years. While the Minister's right honourable friend the Secretary of State says that we should seek not to erode core activities, is he aware that the Victoria and Albert has already taken all the necessary steps, as I imagine have other museums, to get maximum value for money by making appropriate savings? If we were to go beyond that in order to meet the Minister's criteria we should be in very serious difficulties. In those circumstances is it too late to ask <P>

<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful that the noble Lord recognises and agrees a need to keep public expenditure under control. At the risk of stating the obvious, it was with no pleasure that these cuts were imposed. The noble Lord described their context. We recognise the steps taken in the past by the trustees of various national institutions and the resourcefulness they have displayed in meeting the difficulties that face them. We appreciate that.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para0"></a>In ensuring that the core activities of the institutions are properly carried out, the important focus is on safeguarding the managing of collections, continuing to promote access to those collections and delivering improved value for money. Bearing in mind the traditional resourcefulness and record of the trustees in this regard, we believe that it will be possible to ensure that appropriate activities are carried on in the museums. It is the case that forward spending plans are determined by the corporate plans of the institutions, which are reviewed every year. If any national institution wishes to discuss the matter with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State, that option is open.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that many of us are very glad to see the Government exercising strong pressure to cut expenditure?

<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, how do the Government reconcile these reductions with the undertakings that they gave, not once but on several occasions, in both Houses of Parliament when the lottery Bill was going through; namely, as a result of lottery money there would be no reduction in the arts budget?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, it is important to be clear. What was said was that there would be no reduction in respect of the lottery. The particular reductions to which the noble Lord refers arose as the result of cuts in public expenditure. There is no direct nexus between the existence of the lottery and the cuts that we are discussing this afternoon.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </B>   My Lords, would my noble friend care to remind the House of what has been a decline in real terms in the purchasing grants; namely, grants for new acquisitions for the nation's major museums? I speak as a trustee of the British Museum. Will my noble friend concede the very sad circumstance that significant purchases from these grants are simply no longer possible for the great museums and the Tate Gallery?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, my understanding is that the specific hypothecated purchasing grant that applied a few years ago no longer applies. It was a general grant to each of the museums. It is up to the <P>


<a name="column_890"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 890</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>trustees and management of the museums to allocate resources in the manner best appropriate to the circumstances in which they find themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para1"></a>It is the case, as we have seen occur frequently, that appeals, and indeed successful applications, are made to the lottery fund in order to help museums acquire new items.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware--I am sure he is--that these damaging cuts of many millions will in reality result in museums and galleries having to reduce the number of hours per day and days per year during which they can open to the public owing to the enormous cost of security for their treasures? How do the Government reconcile that with the department's declared public policy of increasing the access of the British public to their cultural institutions and cultural life?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord draws from cuts conclusions that I do not believe are justified according to logic. As I said to a supplementary question from the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State emphasised that the important core activities for the museums are to safeguard and manage the collections; to continue to promote access to them; and to deliver improved value for money. We believe that that approach will achieve the kind of results that we all hope to see.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Mowbray and Stourton: </B>   My Lords, would not the museum authorities gain more credit if certain among them--not the main museums to which my noble friend and other noble Lords referred--do not support prizes to people who produce cows' and sheep's intestines? That does not help the art world in its search for help for more important matters.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, in the context of an aesthetic debate, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. My noble friend expresses his personal opinion; other noble Lords may hold different views.

<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para5"></a>At the outset, I pay a very warm tribute to our Clerk, Andrew Makower, whose dedication, expertise and drafting skills were in every way exceptional. Since he moved on to pastures new, the flag of Sub-Committee I has been ably carried by Philippa Tudor.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para6"></a>The United Kingdom is among the world's leaders in biomedical research and UK scientists are at the forefront of rapid developments in diagnosis and treatment. In 1988, the Science and Technology Committee of this House reported that the NHS was too passive in its partnership with research, in that it neither set a research agendum nor was successful in getting research findings into practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para7"></a>In 1991, the Government responded by appointing a director of research and development for the NHS in England, Professor Michael Peckham, now Sir Michael Peckham. He launched the NHS R&D strategy, the first of its kind in the world. The NHS then began to identify its research needs, to commission research to meet them, to disseminate the findings and get them into practice; and, importantly, to improve its own research practice by training staff, including groups not traditionally thought of as research leaders, such as nurses, therapists and managers.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para8"></a>The strategy aims to foster a knowledge-based service as well as evidence-based medical practice. Similar developments have been launched in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Happily, in recent years, through this initiative and through the efforts of the Medical Research Council, health services research and operational research, which analyse the nation's health needs and the means of delivering health services, have expanded. Research and development are neither luxuries nor optional extras. They constitute a fundamental and crucial component of our health services, upon which the lifeblood of medical and social advance depend. That research is backed by substantial resources provided by the research councils, the pharmaceutical industry, the taxpayer, the universities and the medical charities and is crucially dependent upon the NHS for access to patients and data. In return, it offers NHS patients the benefit of the latest advances and of care by leading practitioners. As I have often said, today's development in basic medical science brings tomorrow's practical development in patient care.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para9"></a>In 1992 and 1993 concern began to grow that medical and dental research was under threat from the NHS reforms. Market forces were applying pressure upon staff time and the resources needed to conduct research and research training. The principle of uncosted mutual support--Knock-for-knock--which formerly governed <P>


<a name="column_892"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 892</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>relationships between medical and dental schools on the one hand and the NHS on the other was breaking down, and devolved decision-making was hampering multi-centre research and the strategic planning of training. Hence, while it was clear that the initiatives of Sir Michael Peckham and his colleagues were succeeding, there was much anxiety about the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para10"></a>The Government responded appropriately by setting up the NHS R&D task force under Professor Culyer, a health economist from York. The Culyer Report was published in September 1994 and recommended a unified NHS budget for research and its support, controlled by Professor Peckham and funded by a levy on purchasers (health authorities and GP fund holders), through which research would be supported explicitly and accountably. The Government accepted those recommendations and they are being implemented. The new system should begin operation from 1st April 1997.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para11"></a>The report of your Lordships' Select Committee, based upon the sub-committee inquiry which I was privileged to chair, was published on 15th June. I and my colleagues are grateful to the Government for their response, published in September. We are glad that the fundamental principles set out in our report and recommendations have been generally endorsed and accepted. Time will not allow me to detail all the important points that we made; but perhaps I may highlight some of the most vital.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para12"></a>First, we are glad that the Government have agreed to stand by their wish to see 1.5 per cent. of the total NHS budget devoted to R&D. In their document published last month, guidance is given to health authorities and trusts about the means by which NHS activity and costs associated with research and development will be identified so that the levy will come into force from April 1997. The R&D strategy relies crucially on the regional directors of R&D, who act as bridge-builders between researchers and NHS purchasers and providers. We are glad that the Government accept the need for a mechanism to bring together researchers and NHS managers to discuss requirements, opportunities and conflicts of interests, and a means of connecting the research community with GP fund holders, whose role as purchasers is of growing significance. We look forward to learning more about the studies that are now being undertaken by various working parties and implementation groups, through whose work these and other proposed developments should become a reality. We are glad too that the Government accept our advice about getting research into practice. We welcome the Effectiveness Bulletins produced by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination in York, as well as the work of the Cochrane Centre in Oxford. But those activities must be accompanied by continuing professional education; and the informed and innovative practitioner must remain free to override evidence if it is either incomplete in the context of the case or out of date.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para13"></a>In our report we deplored the wall of accounting which had begun to divide healthcare from research. The cost of separating the scientist from the clinician is likely to be increasingly high, both in transaction costs <P>


<a name="column_893"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 893</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and in the creative interactions which will not take place at all because busy people will find it difficult to tolerate the artificiality of costing and accounting for them.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para14"></a>We are glad that the Culyer task force produced a set of principles commanding general assent in order to overcome those difficulties. It is indeed crucial that a stream of research facilities funding be identified from the levy to support NHS institutions with a major commitment to research, including all university-related centres of healthcare delivery. That will replace the research element of SIFT(R) (the service increment for teaching (and research)) which in the past has supported very largely teaching hospitals. Also it will replace non-SIFT(R), which supports research in some non-teaching hospitals) as well as the central support formerly enjoyed by the eight postgraduate hospitals in London. Research facilities funding will in due course be allocated selectively through a research assessment exercise. We are glad that the Government agree that that must be integrated as closely as possible with the similar exercise regularly undertaken by the higher education funding councils, thus avoiding costly duplication of effort. The R&D stream will clearly require a component to fund activities planned centrally by the director of R&D and his regional directors. It is equally clear that funds must be made available to the regional directors to operate schemes of responsive funding for research projects at local level, like the old locally operated research schemes, which often helped young doctors, scientists and others to take their first research steps.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para15"></a>Plainly too a separate funding stream must be identified to underpin research in primary care, general practice and community settings and be available also to support research and development undertaken by nurses and other healthcare professionals. Clearly, however, the most substantial component of R&D money will provide the excess service support and the infrastructure needed in our hospitals to create the environment in which biomedical research, which is so important and vital a feature of our NHS, can continue to flourish and indeed develop.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para16"></a>We have suggested that some such funding or alternatively special new regional reserves may be used to fund tertiary referrals to centres of excellence. Those have declined sharply under the internal market, which has applied pressure to purchasers not to refer, thus hampering major research projects in both rare and common diseases and often meaning that patients have received less expert treatment. We are glad that the Government accept the need to educate purchasers about how research nurtures developments in patient care and about the importance of patient flows to research. Major academic centres must be permitted to use facilities funds to set competitive prices so as to attract referrals.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para17"></a>The Government's R&D initiative proved very successful, not least in relation to the programmes of health services research and operational research which have been introduced, some nationally and some led from individual regions. The Medical Research Council also supported much excellent health services research. When our report expressed potential concern about mission drift by the MRC, that was construed by some <P>


<a name="column_894"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 894</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as suggesting that the committee felt that the MRC should no longer be involved in health services research. Nothing is further from the truth.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para18"></a>Our intention was to indicate that further expansion of MRC programmes in this field would carry the potential risk of duplicating work being done through the NHS R&D initiative. The committee was concerned that a higher proportion of MRC funds might in future be devoted to that field at a time when many excellent biomedical research projects simply cannot be funded, despite being highly rated by the MRC on scientific grounds. However, I must stress that we regard health services research as being of fundamental importance to the future of the NHS. We learnt with some dismay that some central initiatives, established under the NHS R&D programme, may be under threat and we trust that that fear proves unfounded.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para19"></a>While much detail remains to be clarified by the bodies established by government to implement the Culyer recommendations and those of the Select Committee, we are confident that the research programmes now emerging and those envisaged for the future, both nationally and locally, will do much to nurture improvements in clinical care and ensure that the United Kingdom remains in the forefront of better health services research and biomedical research. Without the appropriate infrastructure, the latter would wither and die.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para20"></a>Our one major recommendation which the Government did not feel able to accept was our wish to see a major inquiry undertaken into the future of academic clinical medicine, which we believe is in crisis. From all parts of the United Kingdom we learn of falling morale and diminished recruitment. The figures published in the Government's response were, frankly, puzzling, as all clinical academic departments in the United Kingdom seem to have suffered from freezing of vacancies and disestablishment of posts. While the NHS has come to the rescue by funding many important academic appointments, a development which is to be greatly welcomed, we gave the reasons--which we thought compelling--why we believe that clinical academic medicine is under serious threat.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para21"></a>Among the many problems of which we have been made aware is the fact that holders of clinical academic posts who have always been closely involved in patient care and in the provision of NHS services, are under increasing pressure from managers to accept an enhanced clinical load. Only two weeks ago the Senate of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons in the UK expressed its concerns publicly, quoting examples of the many difficulties which now beset those seeking training for a career in academic surgery. It quoted many examples, such as the fact that two chairs of cardiothoracic surgery now established have failed to attract any suitable applicants. Only this morning I learnt from the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals that in early 1995, 54 established clinical chairs in universities with medical schools were vacant; 20 had been vacant for more than 12 months.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para22"></a>While Her Majesty's Government rejected our proposal that a major inquiry should be launched, I am glad to say that the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and <P>


<a name="column_895"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 895</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Principals is now setting up such an inquiry under the chairmanship of Sir Rex Richards, former vice-chancellor of Oxford University and with, I hope, funding from a charitable body. I and my colleagues on the committee are convinced that the problems facing clinical academic medicine bode ill for the future of clinical teaching and research and therefore for the future of medicine.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para23"></a>Finally, while I am commenting upon the crucial role of the universities in this regard, perhaps I may inquire as to why regulations relating to the appointment of university nominees to the new health authorities promised in March have not yet emerged? What effect will reductions in capital spending, announced in last month's Budget, have upon the proposed reorganisation of London and other medical schools and their associated hospitals? How will the much needed expansion in medical student numbers be financed?
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para24"></a>Those points are all vitally important to academic medicine. We trust that the CVCP inquiry will proceed with all reasonable speed. we trust also that when that body reports, the Government may then accept that such an investigation was much needed and will be prepared to take account of its findings. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para25"></a>Moved, That this House takes note of the report of the Science and Technology Committee on Medical Research and the NHS Reforms [3rd Report, 1994-95, H.L. Paper 12].--(Lord Walton of Detchant.)

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Prys-Davies: </B>   My Lords, I thank the committee, especially its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, for its labour and report. Together with the two volumes of evidence, it is a substantive report. I am also grateful to the noble Lord for his affirmative and positive opening speech this afternoon. Clearly I speak as a layman. Nevertheless, I believe that research work needs the support of lay people in the United Kingdom. Speaking as a layman, it is appropriate that I give the House an assurance that I shall be brief; I give that promise.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para26"></a>I wish to raise two points of detail which are not unrelated to the main thrust of the report. First, I want to add words of support for the recommendations in paragraphs 4.52 and 5.29 of the report. Those are recommendations that the attractions and appeal of academic posts should be enhanced. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, spoke of that towards the end of his speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para27"></a>When I read the report I strongly supported the setting up of an immediate inquiry to find ways and means of enhancing the prospects of clinical careers in medical schools. I am sure that many noble Lords will be aware of bright young doctors who have much to offer to clinical teaching and research. But as the committee points out, they are understandably attracted away from the medical schools by the greater financial rewards of consultancy posts in the NHS combined with the possibility of the fees to be gained from private practice.
<P>


<a name="column_896"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 896</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para28"></a>It seems to me, and to those with whom I consulted, that the existing salary arrangements act as a disincentive to work in medical schools. If the brightest people desert medical education, the consequences over time must be serious. Indeed, the evidence received by the committee suggests that that is already a serious problem. That too was underlined by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, this afternoon. I am sorry, therefore, that the Government did not respond positively to the call for an immediate inquiry. But I am gratified to learn that the inquiry is in hand.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para29"></a>I turn to my second point and trust that the House will bear with me. I want to ask about the research undertaken in Wales. I am glad to see that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gwydir, a former Secretary of State responsible for health matters in Wales, is in his place. Having served in the Welsh hospital service many years ago, I have maintained a special interest in medical research being undertaken in regions generally and in Wales in particular. I wish to make two comments on that aspect. I accept, of course, that research is no respecter of boundaries.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para30"></a>Nevertheless, I believe it is important that medical and health service research should be undertaken in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as in London and the regions of England. Of course I accept that the areas of the research need to be defined, mapped out and resourced in conjunction with the programmes of other institutions further afield; otherwise there could be a waste of valuable resources. I am glad that the need for regional or local research, as it was called, was underlined by a number of witnesses when they appeared before the committee. Indeed, it has been underlined this afternoon by the chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Walton.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para31"></a>Nothing that I say today about the position in Wales detracts in any way from my appreciation of the contribution of the University of Wales College of Medicine, the only medical school in Wales, and the research work which it is undertaking. I am also well aware of the work which has been undertaken by the Medical Research Council in Wales. I am also conscious of the contribution of the Welsh medical charity, Tenovus. Nevertheless, regrettably, it seems to me that the Welsh Office did not submit any evidence to the Select Committee, and that omission in itself may be evidence that there are problems. I am afraid that there is reason for thinking that medical and health service research paid for out of the public purse is not supported as it ought to be by the Welsh Office. Indeed, there is evidence in the report and in the two volumes of evidence for that apprehension.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para32"></a>First, it appears in the evidence of Dr. Evered of the MRC, printed on page 61 of volume 1, that the amount of research and development work in England and Scotland,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is much greater than in Wales and in Northern Ireland". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Indeed, that inadequacy is amply illustrated by comparing the brief and barren Appendix 12 printed in the report which relates to Wales with the fulsome Appendix 11 relating to Scotland and the <P>


<a name="column_897"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 897</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information-laden Appendix 8 relating to research activity in England. One has to ask what R&D programmes are being undertaken in Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para33"></a>The written evidence of the Department of Health is almost silent on the issue except that it offers this pretty bland sentence, to be found on page 6 of volume 1. I quote:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"NHS Wales has allocated funds to support research and development directed towards better health, better services and choice, and better value for money". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Not much light there, my Lords. The statement goes on to add:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Research and Development Forum has identified an initial series of research priorities". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
But that leads to the question: what are those priorities? So far as I can see, from reading the report and the volumes of evidence, they are not identified in the department's evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para34"></a>Moreover, the disquiet and the frustration which are felt among researchers in Wales emerge in a sad letter from Professor Borysiewicz of the University College of Medicine, which is printed on page 478 of the second volume. The professor writes:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Among researchers in Wales there are numerous areas of disquiet pertaining to the organisation, commitment and continuity of NHS R&D but clearly these are not going to be resolved until a new director is in post". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para35"></a>Secondly, there has been this inordinate delay on the part of the Welsh Office in appointing the R&D director. Indeed, this was a cause of anxiety to the Select Committee itself. I am glad that the committee has drawn our attention to this state of affairs. It has done so in paragraph 4.53 and in recommendation 5.30 of the report.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para36"></a>As the report was published seven months ago, I should like to be assured that the Welsh Office has by now sorted out the various problems and that it is on course to create the right environment in Wales for medical and health service researchers. Nevertheless, I have to say that the delay in making an appointment accords ill with professed support for research.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para37"></a>Thirdly, and finally, there may be another point of some anxiety. This derives from a sentence in Appendix 12 of the report which reads,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"according to press reports, the Secretary of State for Wales took a personal interest in the selection of projects". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
"Personal interest" is not exactly a term of art. What is the meaning and implication of that term in the context of Appendix 12? Does it mean that the Secretary of State as a layman, and not in his capacity as Secretary of State, sought to influence the choice? I recognise that the Government must have an effective say in this area as in other areas of policy involving public expenditure. On the other hand, I am sure it would be agreed that research priorities should not be influenced by the personal preferences of the Secretary of State as a layman. Therefore, I want to ask for clarification of the meaning of the sentence which I have quoted and which is to be found in Appendix 12.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para38"></a>The Welsh Office and the research selection procedures must leave no doubt in the public mind as to whether choices of research priorities are decided on the <P>


<a name="column_898"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 898</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>merits of the case. I should add that the evidence does not reveal whether the personal interest of the Secretary of State in the end prevailed. I am wondering whether it did.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para39"></a>All I have sought to do on this issue is briefly to draw attention to that part of the evidence submitted to the Select Committee which suggests that the Welsh Office has fallen short, possibly far short, of giving satisfaction in this area. I shall listen with great care to whatever information the Minister can give the House when she comes to reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Perry of Walton: </B>   My Lords, as a member of the committee I start by paying tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, who was a splendid chairman. The noble Lord, Lord Flowers, and I were both very privileged to be members not only of this committee but of the original committee in 1988 which produced the report on priorities in medical research. I should like to give two small quotations from that report. Paragraph 9.10 said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Science-led research should be dominant. The main focus of public policy in medical research should be the creation of a strong infrastructure for research and the supply of a strongly motivated and well-trained research community". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Paragraph 9.14 said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The funding of applied research in medicine is unsatisfactory, and the key lies in the NHS". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para40"></a>In all my recollection of the meetings of that first committee in 1988 I cannot remember one single occasion when we did not talk of the NHS needs which we spelt out at great length and which were very important. We said that they should be complementary to the basic biomedical research to which the noble Lord, Lord Walton, has already referred. We were naturally delighted in 1989 when the Government accepted virtually all the recommendations of the 1988 report and when in 1991 the new NHS research and development strategy was published. It was a new culture in the service. It was a knowledge-based service and it was to be a culture of evaluation. That was an absolutely splendid decision that everybody welcomed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para41"></a>The one recommendation that we made in 1988, which was not accepted by government, was that the new strategy should be supported by a special allocation of funds. The Government rejected that on the grounds that it would not be compatible with the science budget. It seemed to me then, and it still seems to me now, that that was wrong because the NHS R&D strategy is not a part of the science base. It is NHS expenditure and not a science expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para42"></a>In 1988 there was no internal market in the NHS, but the introduction of the internal market led to another new culture in the service based on value for money. Whether one agrees with that culture or not, it is certainly compatible with the NHS R&D strategy, which is a knowledge-based and evaluation culture, but it is not compatible with science-driven research, which is not always cost-effective. Many things which are started do not succeed; only some of them do, but they are very important.

<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para43"></a>The introduction of the market ignored the needs of the new strategy for research and development. That was natural enough because it is only 1 per cent. of the expenditure of the NHS; 99 per cent. of it is for looking after patients. As the noble Lord, Lord Walton, mentioned, that led to the creation of the Culyer task force to produce a report on how to deal with research problems. It came up with the idea of a single stream of NHS funding which was actually divided into three streams. One fund was for research promoted by the NHS itself; the second was to cover the service costs of projects in NHS institutions, with many of them being externally funded; and the third was to provide research facilities in those NHS institutions, mainly the teaching hospitals, which were centres of high quality research.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para44"></a>These were sensible principles and they were generally welcomed, but they mixed up funding for NHS R&D strategy with funding for the support services that I mentioned, which are really services for the science base itself. The Culyer task force principles did not go into detail as to how they were to be implemented. In May 1995 an implementation plan was published but there were no details. I regret to say that that plan only created six more implementation sub-groups, and we await to hear their results.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para45"></a>Our report in May of that year suggested in our many recommendations ways in which some of these matters could be implemented. But in September, in the Government's response to our report, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton, said, they gave general endorsement to these proposals but not any details as to how they were to be implemented. They said that our suggestions were under consideration by the various implementation sub-groups, but we still do not have any details as to how they are to be implemented.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para46"></a>The NHS R&D strategy is controlled by the central research and development committee which reports to and advises the director of research and development, who in turn is a member of the NHS Executive and advises it. It controls the money bags. When the central research and development committee was set up, it very rightly, following the recommendations of the 1988 committee, adopted an approach that was problem-led and not science-driven. But the Culyer recommendations for a single stream of research includes, as I said, part of the service support of a science base. I believe that that has led to the root cause of the natural academic fear that the central research and development committee and the NHS Executive will in time come to favour problem-led projects; despite the assurances that have been given by Ministers and others, the trend will always tend to be in that direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para47"></a>That is not in any way to say that it is not important to cover all these NHS problem-led matters. All the many institutions of the NHS such as general practice, nursing and so on all need problem-led research. Perhaps I may give one example from our current report which appears in Chapter 5, paragraph 13:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We welcome the creation of a stream of 'research facilities funding' to support the additional infrastructure needed in NHS settings which support clinical research to a significant extent. The <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 900</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>central research and development committee must resist the temptation progressively to shift the balance away from essential core funding in favour of project funding". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That brought a response from the Government which was not very reassuring: they said that they accepted the need for stability in institutions doing high quality research. My conclusion was that, without guaranteed separate stream funding for academic research, I could see no way to remove long-term academic fears. These fears already affect adversely our medical schools. I beg the Government to act soon in producing details of how they are going to solve the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para48"></a>I now come to paragraph 5.29 of the report where we said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We note the combined effect on clinically qualified academics of uncertainty engendered by the NHS reforms (including the problems noted above in relation to referrals, hospital rationalisation, local pay and the continuing capacity of the NHS to fund academic posts); the shortage of career-grade academic posts; the increasing loads of service provision, administration and teaching; the consequences of the unified training grade; and the proposed changes to the system of Distinction Awards. We consider that the disincentives to a clinical academic career are now so great as to warrant an immediate enquiry in their own right". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
 The Government's response to that recommendation was that the evidence we had for our recommendation was anecdotal and there was no firm basis for it that they knew of. But in the past few days I have received from the BMA a report completely endorsing the recommendations in Chapter 5, paragraph 29. As the noble Lord, Lord Walton, mentioned, a report came from the CVCP, which has acted unilaterally on that very recommendation.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para49"></a>I should like to go a little further in quoting the CVCP which stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Difficulties exist in recruiting and retaining clinical staff in academic posts in some fields ... Problems are caused by: </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>a lack of confidence in the NHS as a provider of resources for teaching and research </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>a perception that career progression is more secure and rapid in non academic medicine </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>an apparent disregard by the NHS of the universities' interests adds to the uncertainty </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>distinction awards at the 'C' award level are to be made locally. Academics believe that they will find it difficult to compete for these awards which represents a further disincentive to take up or stay with an academic career". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The CVCP then stated that it was taking steps to set up an independent inquiry.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para50"></a>It is clear that worries are widespread in academic medicine. Another cause of those worries, apart from those mentioned by the CVCP, is that an increased clinical load continues to fall on the clinical academics employed by the universities, with the result that they have much less time for research.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para51"></a>Finally, I should like to call attention to the communication that I have received from the BMA which tells me that jobs in clinical departments at some medical schools are already being filled by non-medical scientists. That gives me a sense of dejo vu because, when I went to Edinburgh in 1958 as professor of pharmacology, nearly all of the pre-clinical Chairs and senior posts in pharmacology were held by medically qualified doctors. There was an enormous differential in <P>


<a name="column_901"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 901</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>salaries between those for pre-clinical senior staff and those for clinical senior staff, not only in terms of the university salary but also because the clinical staff were eligible for distinction awards. The result is that nowadays there is hardly a medically qualified man holding a senior appointment in a pre-clinical department in our medical schools. That represents a real loss for the training for medical undergraduates because such people, able as they are as scientists, have no understanding or experience of patient care in medical science. We must not let that happen in clinical departments.

<A NAME="51205-03_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Butterfield: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for this opportunity to express my appreciation of the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Walton. He did us the honour of sending the text of what he was going to say to those of us who served on the committee. As I read it, I realised that, as has often happened to me before in relation to the noble Lord and medical affairs, it was hard to see what I should be able to add to the complete case that he had set out. Indeed, on many occasions in your Lordships' House I have heard noble Lords say, "Previous speakers have said most or all of what I wanted to say, and I can only say how much I agree with them".
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para52"></a>It is in the spirit of trying to widen your Lordships' view of the remarkable development that has occurred for the NHS in this country under Professor Michael Peckham that I should like to add a few small pieces of extra information. Perhaps I may first tell your Lordships about Michael Peckham. All of your Lordships will know that intellectual activities have an artistic and creative quality and content. I was absolutely delighted when I met Michael Peckham for the first time in his office because he showed me on the walls pictures which he himself had painted. That is not very common among professors of clinical subjects. Some of us have daughters or sons who paint, but do not do so ourselves, so I was most impressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para53"></a>I should like to pay tribute to the way in which Michael Peckham has dealt with this incredibly complex national problem. I agree with the feelings that reign in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland about the importance of carrying the message to those parts of our United Kingdom. Michael Peckham took a complicated and complex subject and worked it out. The lovely thing about Michael Peckham is that he has a very clear mind and an extremely good way of expressing himself at meetings and in committees. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Walton, will nod his agreement to the fact that when Professor Peckham appeared before us, he spoke straightforwardly about the problems. I think that we all realised that usually he had the great advantage of talking about the problems as he knew them at that moment, whereas we were talking of what we had heard perhaps a week or two before.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para54"></a>Michael Peckham has one other great asset in his work, Mrs. Peckham. She is medically qualified. She is what we call an epidemiologist. She looks at problems in the round, out there, outside the laboratory. I once <P>


<a name="column_902"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 902</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>had a Scottish master, a Fellow of the Royal Society, Ronald Grant, who told me when I went to work for him that he was worried by the fact that I had recently married because it was his very strong impression that the best research was carried out by misogynists who could think of nothing but research. Well, Michael Peckham had the enormous advantage of being able to talk about research at home all the time and he will probably have got very good advice from a lady we all recognise as highly intelligent and very knowledgable. If Professor Peckham is here--he may be--I hope that he will accept that, in saying that, I do not wish to detract from his own achievements.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para55"></a>Having said that, perhaps I may say how very much I agree with the comments that have been made about our Clerk. In addition, our earlier committee owed a great deal to Professor Walter Holland of St. Thomas' Hospital who way back in 1988 perceived how important it would be to stir up and infuse the NHS with practical science and health services research as well as fundamental medical ideas.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para56"></a>During the past five years Michael Peckham has seen a revolution come about: we now talk about knowledge-based medicine. By that, I hope that we mean medicine which is based on what is known (from recent research) about the best way to do this, that or the other. We should not be talking about computers and saying, "This person has had this test; push the button and give them that". Whatever happens, knowledge-based medicine must be put to the patients with understanding, with an understanding of human beings. The importance of that aspect of medicine is referred to in our report.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para57"></a>It is important to look at what has happened during the past five years while Peckham has been at the helm. It is important to realise that it was launched, miraculously, without exciting an enormous amount of irritation and jealousy in the Medical Research Council and among the academic professors and others who might easily have taken a serious view of an organisation which could get into top gear with the promise presently of 1.5 per cent. of the costs of the NHS. In round numbers, we are talking about 1.5 per cent. of &#163;30 billion. If you were a chemist working for the great German firm Hoechst, you would think that 1.5 per cent. spent on R&D was not a high proportion. However, for those of us in medical research, it is a very high figure.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para58"></a>While preparing for this afternoon's debate, I have been delving around trying to find out about that 1.5 per cent. in terms of the allocation of funds. As a benchmark, the MRC spends about &#163;300 million a year on medical research, and the charities roughly the same figure. In a recent press release, the Secretary of State for Health indicated that he has increased the resources for the R&D strategy to &#163;436 million in the coming year. That is a very large sum of money. It will not be quite the bonanza that some people think, because all of us in the research corridors of non-power are aware that when one talks about the price of the research strategy in the NHS that will include all the calculations of what the noble Lord, Lord Walton, referred to as the knock-for-knock principle.
<P>


<a name="column_903"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 903</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para59"></a>We never did any accounting on what it cost to have the tests done for my diabetes. It is probably a good thing that we did not. Nor did other people have the costs of the beds they used for their research put against their accounts. That was all part and parcel of the knock-for-knock: we took care of the patients; they paid for our excess costs. I suspect that much of that &#163;436 million may have to be accounted for in the modern NHS as money needed to support research: money that the research will cost.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para60"></a>All of us on the committee felt strongly that it was important that the regional directors--the people whom Sir Michael chose to support him--should have funds with which they could support young people starting out in research. There are two wonderful phrases. One is an old phrase--"pre-protocol research"--which meant that one was doing research that was so early that one could not work out exactly what one was going to do. One was going to make some exploratory observations--pre-protocol. There is another new, wonderful phrase that I found in a document sent to me by my friends on the MRC. It is called "response mode support"; in other words, it is responding to a suggestion that something is tried and undertaken.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para61"></a>It would be important to all of us on the committee to hear, if the Minister can tell us, whether any part of that &#163;436 million will be allocated to regional directors of R&D for them to spend on the local medical schools and on encouraging young people to start. That same man--R. T. Grant--who was a little upset that when I joined him I had recently married, would be very concerned were there to be no means for young people to start research. I was called obstreperous. That was why I was put into research. "We have got to get rid of him off the ward. Put him in a research lab. He is too obstreperous". There must be a means by which young people can get their start. My plea is that we ensure, through clever and lighthanded management centrally, that money is made available to the regional directors of research, all of whom we know and of whom we think the world. They are very good men.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para62"></a>Finally, I strongly support the anxieties that were expressed in the committee and have been expressed this afternoon about morale in the academic medical departments. I see the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, on the opposite Benches. She will remember when we were talking about the newly organised health service and how I, and I believe the noble Lord, Lord Walton, were keen to have a uniform salary. We made the point from the academics' view that, if we did not have a uniform salary structure, there were real risks that people would not be able to do what we would think of as the good things.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para63"></a>In fact, there is no uniform salary structure. Understandably, authority has been given down the line to hospitals to have their own salaries within the NHS. We cannot do that yet academically within the ordinary organisation of university posts. Perhaps we will have to do that to reignite the morale of the young doctors who are in the teaching departments. Meanwhile, Minister, if you can indicate that there will be money for regional directors of R&D that they can use to <P>

<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew21"></A><B> The Earl of Selborne: </B>   My Lords, it will be already evident to noble Lords that there was much highly expert advice available within the committee. There were many people serving on the committee who knew a great deal about the subject. The noble Lords, Lord Perry of Walton and Lord Flowers, had served on the 1988 committee. Above all, we were lucky enough to have the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, as our chairman. Although it is a formality sometimes to congratulate the chairman, as the first layman on the committee to speak I have to say that we relied heavily upon his knowledge and experience, despite all the other expertise that was available to us.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para64"></a>The subject, as has been said, was being revisited for the second time, the committee in 1988 having produced what must be termed a seminal report. We have heard of the great work of Professor Michael Peckham and of the change of culture--it can only be described as that--within the NHS now that there is an R&D strategy and all that flows from it. There is no doubt that the 1988 committee report was highly instrumental and influential in bringing about that change of culture.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para65"></a>I pay tribute to the late Lord Nelson of Stafford who chaired that committee and who was able to serve as a co-opted member of the committee for a while until ill health forced his retirement. That demonstrates how the Select Committee procedure enables continuity of expertise which has proved highly valuable in this instance. Having done so much in 1989--the Government took a year and three-quarters to respond, but respond they did and very effectively--it appeared by 1993 that much of that great progress was at risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para66"></a>This Select Committee inquiry would have been established earlier in 1993 had not the then Secretary of State set up the Culyer task force. The fears which were clearly apparent at that time arose from the changes in fundholding, concern about the long-term future of clinical research, and concern as to whether the hard-won changes in the culture could survive. The terms of reference of the Culyer task force were appropriate. When we saw that it was to report within a relatively short period--it was briefed to report by April 1994--I am sure that we were right to step back, report on Culyer, if necessary, and take note as well of the development of the R&D strategy led by Professor Peckham. That is precisely what the report in the event proved to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para67"></a>There was no great difficulty determining that the Culyer recommendations dealt with the major central issue from which all the uncertainty and concern arose, which was the funding stream. Clearly, changes in administration and fund holding cause all sorts of alarm bells to ring. From the Culyer Report came the single funding stream and the 1.5 per cent. about which noble Lords have heard. Everything else pales into insignificance. The next issue is how one determines the apportionment of that funding stream. A stream is a <P>


<a name="column_905"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 905</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>slightly misleading metaphor; it is more like a delta. It starts as a fund: what is important is how it is distributed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para68"></a>The Culyer Report makes it clear that there are three branches to the delta: first, projects and programmes, to which one must add supporting functions which would include information strategy and the development of research capacity; secondly, service support; and thirdly, research facilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para69"></a>As a layman on the committee I was perhaps a little cynical as time after time we heard special pleading from all sorts of sectors as to how important it was that that particular sector should be the beneficiary of the funding streams. People were capable of rubbishing the expertise and talents of other sectors. The academics would point out, for example, that there was little research culture within the area of general practitioners or nursing and how dangerous it was therefore to divert too much funding there. It is important to discount special pleading and to take a clear-sighted view at regional level as to where funding should go.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para70"></a>Of the three streams, the first, which concerns projects and is supported by the information strategy, is an extremely important development of the research and development strategy itself. It is almost inconceivable that way back in 1992 there was no clear record of the research that was going on in the National Health Service. There was no central data bank. Therefore, the project register system was started in 1993. It is a network of registers of research projects with guidance from a central co-ordinating unit. The intention is to produce a national database of medical research projects. It is essential to know what research is being carried out in the National Health Service and helpful to have that linked adequately with the Medical Research Council, the work of medical charities and the work funded or undertaken by industry. I hope that we shall be able to move towards a totally comprehensive register system which will be widely available to anyone who has any right to access. At the moment there appears to be little access outside regional research and development directorates. There are, however, funding implications. A register of this nature must be kept up to date and properly resourced.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para71"></a>A second component of the information strategy is the Cochrane Centre and latterly the York Centre. The Cochrane Centre is part of the international Cochrane Collaboration. The report makes several statements about that exciting concept. Perhaps I may explain the rationale of the Cochrane Centre to those of your Lordships who are not familiar with it. Since resources are finite it is important that they are used efficiently both as regards the delivery of care and research. Information about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions must be readily available and used by decision-makers in the National Health Service. The planning of new research must be based on clear information of what is required, what is not already available and what is already being done in research programmes.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para72"></a>The Cochrane centres are conducting reviews of the work in progress and are determining best practice. There are pitfalls, made clear to the committee and <P>


<a name="column_906"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 906</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mentioned at paragraph 2.17; for example, using techniques beyond their proper limits. There is clearly a need to make information available in a user-friendly way to the practitioner but there is clearly a danger of overload. However, there is overload already from perhaps more traditional methods of imparting information. One of the merits of current developments in information systems is that much complicated, highly specialist review information can be made available to the practitioner or to the manager in a way that should be user friendly. While recognising the constraints from which these techniques suffer, I greatly welcome the initiative. It is a highly important part of the information strategy.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para73"></a>Finally, perhaps I may comment on the role of the regional directors of research. It is the key level at which the competing pressures for funds, to which I referred earlier, must ultimately be decided. We have heard today that academic medicine should not be discouraged from undertaking its proper role of contributing towards education, training, research, design and much else. But there is also need for research in prevention and care in the National Health Service. Perhaps that is something of a Cinderella area and not always of great interest to the clinical research community educated in biochemistry and physiology.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para74"></a>We have heard that the academic community has many concerns about possible threats to the research programmes. Perhaps I may make a plea that, having recognised that, we also recognise the research opportunities and contributions that can be made by general practitioners, the nursing community and non-medical health professionals. All have a perfectly valid role to play in research. If they do not have the research culture so historically and firmly behind them, that is all the more reason why the research culture needs to be developed in those areas. I am sure that the present research and development strategy is correctly designed in order to obtain wider research funding.

<A NAME="51205-03_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness McFarlane of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, I with the noble Lords, Lord Perry and Lord Flowers, had the great privilege of serving on both the Committee on Priorities in Medical Research, chaired by the late Lord Nelson of Stafford, which reported in 1988 and on the present Committee on Medical Research and the NHS Reforms, so ably chaired by my noble friend Lord Walton. The Government response to the 1988 report was very positive and led to the appointment of Professor Michael Peckham, whose praises we have already heard sung today. I am sure that we would all wish to join in congratulating him on all that he achieved in a short space of time. Within three months he announced a new research and development strategy with the objective of delivering health service care which is knowledge-based and has a culture of evaluation. That can be made possible only through high-quality research.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para75"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, gave the House a commendable introduction to the background of the present committee, the concerns of the medical <P>


<a name="column_907"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 907</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>profession and the concern that the amount of health service research could lead to detraction from clinical medical research. It is right, therefore, that the major focus of our report should take that as its main point; that is, hospital-based clinical research and its vital relationship with academic medicine. Those are of immense importance to all those engaged in healthcare. It is only by pushing back the boundaries of medical knowledge that advances in treatment can be made. In that respect, it is in the interest of the patient that there is a seamless robe between the practice of clinical medicine and academic research.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para76"></a>I wish to dwell a little more on a point to which the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, has already alluded. I wish to open up the debate into the area of the other disciplines involved in health service research. Only brief references were made at various points in our report, principally in the paragraph related to research outside the major university hospitals and in paragraphs 1.18, 3.16 to 3.18 and 5.8. It is my view that despite the dominance and accepted importance of medical research, a number of the older professions, such as my own of nursing and midwifery, have only recently had access to higher education and to research thinking and research facilities. Furthermore, a number of newer professions in the health service need to research their practice. If the delivery of healthcare in the NHS is to be informed and knowledge-based with a culture of evaluation, the research and development of all professions needs to be cultivated. That is why I was particularly grateful for the reference in the Government response to our report at paragraph 16 which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We recognise that all professional staff have an important contribution to make. However their contribution will depend upon support and professional development. The implementation of evidence-based practice will be greatly facilitated by the participation of nurses and members of other professions allied to medicine who spend most of their time in direct patient care. This is a priority for RDRDs and their NHS networks". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para77"></a>The Culyer Report, to which reference has been made, suggested that all NHS settings should compete for R&D funding on equal terms. Our report expresses the concern that some disproportionate amount of research resource could be diverted from the needs of medical research. To me, that seems a rather defensive position, but we need to identify a distinct stream of funds within the R&D levy to underpin research in primary care, general practice and community settings.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para78"></a>We state categorically that while hospital-based research is of vital importance:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it must increasingly share resources with research in primary care settings, and research in what Professor Culyer calls the 'Cinderella disciplines': general practice, nursing, midwifery and health visiting and the professions allied to medicine". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para79"></a>Six months on from the report, I have come to dislike the description of my own profession among others as a Cinderella discipline. I should prefer to talk about under-resourced disciplines. I believe that now is the time to redress the balance in the interests of patient care between those disciplines and what is being devoted to medical research.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para80"></a>It is useful to look at what the NHS R&D strategy has done for some of those professions. Most of the nurses with whom I have spoken were happy with the outcomes of the recommendations arising from the 1988 report Priorities in Medical Research and the strategy that arose from that. In particular, they are in favour of a multi-disciplinary approach to health service research. That has resulted in a far greater involvement of nurses in research teams and a better allocation of resources to the development of academic disciplines.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para81"></a>That is a positive outcome with which I go along pragmatically. But there may be some negative outcomes in concentrating on multi-disciplinary research. First, the distinctive nursing contribution may not be identified and nursing, within multi-disciplinary research, may become invisible. Secondly, the knowledge base for nursing practice, which we would hope would emanate from research, would not be identified specifically. Lastly, the research models and methodologies developed for other disciplines may not always be suitable for investigating questions of nursing practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para82"></a>Of course, there are some who take a simplistic view that the only respectable and universally applicable research method is the randomised controlled trial, and they hold that nothing else can be dignified with the name of research. There are many professions which would question that thesis. Some nursing questions lend themselves to randomised controlled trials; others are far more susceptible to, for example, the social sciences.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para83"></a>In 1992, the Director of Research and Development and the Chief Nursing Officer set up a task force on research in nursing, midwifery and health visiting which was chaired by Professor Adrian Webb who is now vice-chancellor of the University of Glamorgan. The task force was asked to consider the nature of nursing research; how to set priorities; conduct research; train researchers; and get research translated into practice. It reported in 1993 and in my view, that report complements wonderfully the report which we have before us today.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para84"></a>It saw nursing research as a branch of health services research, embracing nursing practice, nursing services and their delivery, the nursing professions and their workforces and their training and deployment, health promotion, and service systems alongside other professions--a very wide range of interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para85"></a>And so I believe that that report is a useful indicator for nursing. It recommended that nursing research should have a full and equal partnership in the NHS R&D strategy and observed that neither the managerial culture nor the nursing practice culture has been sufficiently supportive. The task force made a number of other recommendations in respect of targeting and enriching research, targeting and enriching funding education for research and the need for an information strategy.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para86"></a>Besides the Webb Report, I believe that the situation in nursing research, as an example of a profession other than the medical profession, has been highlighted in the research assessment exercise carried out by the Higher Education Funding Council in 1992. That demonstrated <P>


<a name="column_909"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 909</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the need for the enrichment of nursing research and education in nursing research very prominently. Both Alison Tierney from the University of Edinburgh and Jane Robinson from the University of Nottingham analysed the results. They appear pretty catastrophic for academic nursing. Twenty-nine nursing departments participated. Nursing ranked at the bottom of the league table of academic disciplines. It came 72nd out of 72 academic cost centres.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para87"></a>That may call into question the whole future of nursing as an academic subject and the allocation of research resources. However, a more detailed analysis of those reports reveals some of the contributing factors. Of the 29 departments assessed, 58 per cent. received the lowest possible rating and a further 24 per cent. were given a two rating, making 82.7 per cent. of the departments having a below average rating. Only five departments rated as average and above: two were given a rating of three; and three departments received a rating of four on a scale of five. No department received a five rating.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para88"></a>But if one analyses the results further, one sees that all the higher grades were in the older universities with longer-established units. All the departments in the new universities--the ex-polytechnics--received a rating of one, with the exception of one that was rated a two. Clearly, the rating may reflect something of the history of those institutions but the returns also illustrate that the length of time for which a department has been established is indicative. That suggests that a discipline such as nursing has a steep learning curve on which to catch up in terms of knowledge and expertise in nursing. I must reflect that the department of the University of Manchester, which I headed until my retirement, achieved departmental status only in 1973; and some progress has been made in 20 years. When we look at some of those older professions which now have a status in higher education--and some of the newer ones--we are considering professions which need a tremendous amount of help in the learning curve which is entailed in taking up a research function.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para89"></a>The Royal College of Nursing has commented on our report and accepts many of its recommendations. The college sees the need for an infrastructure funding for research and development, and calls for central monitoring of the deployment in that respect. Its monitoring of the implementation of the Webb Report revealed that it was very patchy. The college endorses the need for a director of research and development in both Wales and Northern Ireland, and has major reservations about our recommendation in paragraph 3.18 that the development of the research workforce capacity should be managed and distributed at local level. In that respect, the college sees a possibility of the disciplines becoming further marginalised. Therefore, that, along with other comments, come from the Royal College of Nursing.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para90"></a>I have attempted to use my own profession as an example to try to illustrate some of the problems of professions moving into higher education, especially as regards their funding for research.

<A NAME="51205-03_spnew23"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I must apologise to the House for arriving late for today's debate. I had so much wanted to hear the noble Lord opening the debate. I welcome the marvellous report that he has produced. However, I was delayed on my way here and, no matter how fast I ran up the stairs, I did not manage to get here on time. Therefore, I hope that I do not repeat any of the earlier comments made. I shall certainly read the noble Lord's opening speech with great interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para91"></a>I have the greatest respect and admiration for those involved in erudite, academic research. But as vice-chairman of North East Thames Regional Health Authority, I also have a very specific interest in how research relates to the every-day delivery of patient care and the needs of the National Health Service, both locally and nationally. When we had to appoint a regional research director for North East Thames, I was fortunate to chair the panel. One of those on the appointment panel with me was Professor--but not then Sir--Michael Peckham. At the end of the interviews, when we had had the choice of many good candidates and, indeed, two quite outstanding ones, we had to weigh up which to choose. One of the questions that I put to the professor was, "How many people with direct general practice experience do you have as directors of research?". The answer was that this person would be the first. It was for that reason that we appointed Professor Andrew Haines, whose appointment I believe has been a great success. It is important that we bear in mind the relevance of research to the treatment of patients.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para92"></a>As I am now chairman of the Royal Free Hospital Trust, I am very aware of how "patient driven"--which I suppose is the expression that I would use--are our research and interest. I say that because we are a most academic hospital; indeed, we are the largest single-site undergraduate teaching hospital in London. The trust and the academic unit are so closely allied that you cannot even differentiate as to which is which within the hospital building. We occupy the same building and are completely intertwined. I believe that that is most desirable. We are not only teaching undergraduates; we are also undertaking marvellous research.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para93"></a>As I listened to the debate, I could not recognise the scenario put forward earlier in the afternoon that academics are feeling a little depressed and not valued enough; indeed, perhaps a little unappreciated. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Perry, made those points. I do not find that at all. Our research people are full of enthusiasm and do all sorts of amazing things that the rest of us can do nothing but marvel at. So many of those initiatives have a practical application to the patients in our care.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para94"></a>I also believe that it is most important that those centres of excellence should continue. I have in mind the very synergy of so many academics under the one roof, all of whom have independent thoughts and views; indeed, one stimulates the other with ideas. It is a situation where they gain from having other people bringing forward ideas and thoughts. Something which <P>


<a name="column_911"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 911</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appealed to me very much in the report was the section on pre-protocol research. I believe that that is to be found at page 28. It is most important.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para95"></a>On page 26 of the report we come across something which is most essential--the R&D levy and the core infrastructure. That is terribly important. There is no way that we could have that quantity of very specialised research duplicated everywhere. In order for people to try out their ideas and develop their interests, they must have the fantastic X-ray machines available. They must have the very latest equipment. There is no way that any country in the world could afford to have such marvellous pieces of modern equipment available in every location. It is much better to have it in the centres of excellence where the people with the brains to use it can be found. That is the way to produce good results for all of us.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para96"></a>I believe that the R&D levy is a most important feature. I say that because the core structure--the infrastructure--could take up almost 80 per cent. of the R&D money. It is a very expensive part of the procedure. But without it research could not continue as it is now.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para97"></a>However, the pre-protocol issue is different. It is about curiosity-driven research. I believe that that is an aspect which we must never underestimate. There will always be carefully designed and thought-out research programmes. Indeed, they are well listed in the report. But if we think back through history to Marie Curie's discovery of radium and Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, we can see that they were findings which came about as much through curiosity as anything else. Yet the whole world has benefited from such marvellous research which would never have happened if we had been tying our researchers and our thinkers purely to matters which had been set down in advance.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para98"></a>I believe that the recommendations for the pre-protocol research in the document are excellent. They will encourage enthusiasts to continue to look at new ideas and new discoveries which will be for the benefit of us all. The report is a marvellous document. I have not had time to read all of it, but what I have read has very much impressed me. Clearly there will be enough reading to keep me going over Christmas.

<A NAME="51205-03_spnew24"></A><B> Lord Nathan: </B>   My Lords, it has been a privilege to sit as a layman under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Walton, who guided us through the intricacies of medical research and the National Health Service with consummate skill and clarity. Indeed, it was an education for me. I propose to confine my brief remarks to research in relation to the patient outside hospital. Therefore, I shall concentrate on the implications of one sentence in the report which appears at paragraph 3.18 and refers to the need for,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"research into the implementation of care in the community, and into the integration of primary services, taking into full account the concerns of the patient". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
There are many well-known reasons for the shift from primary to secondary care. There have been welcome initiatives in pursuing research on R&D priorities in <P>


<a name="column_912"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 912</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>relation to the interface between primary and secondary care. The subjects, numbering 21, identified in the report of a group under the chairmanship of Professor Roger Jones, published in 1994, certainly require investigation. They include the transfer of information across the interface between healthcare professionals and other agencies; the impact on referrals and discharge of including patients and carers in decision-making; and aftercare, rehabilitation and community care for priority groups. They are but examples drawn from the long list. They impinge on the subjects of special concern to me.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para99"></a>It seems to me that urgent consideration needs to be given to ensuring that in the primary care sector the patient knows who is in charge of his care, that that person will be responsible for managing the team and organising the treatment and care by the appropriate member of the team, and that the person in charge is available to be consulted. The exchange of information between those involved is of first importance in the interests of the patient. That requirement is, of course, additional to the wider need for exchange of information between all involved in healthcare, to which Professor Jones's report relates.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para100"></a>I suggest that this area deserves a research study on its own so that the guidelines for action will be clear. They need not be the same in every situation. Such a study will inevitably be interdisciplinary, involving those in the voluntary sector, social services, nursing and other professions allied to medicine, as well as the medical profession itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para101"></a>This leads me to wonder whether there would be advantage in the development of some new medical school incorporating a patient-centred curriculum, with students meeting patients from the first year onward and experiencing a range of practice settings; community-oriented clinical training with experience across the whole spectrum of health services, including their interface with the support services and experience of multi-disciplinary care; and consideration of socio-economic factors in health. Such elements would involve so radical a departure from the curriculum of existing medical schools that it seems that they might most easily be implemented in a new institution.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para102"></a>The Culyer Report devotes considerable space to care in the community, which I much welcome. It is a subject of great public concern. I shall be grateful if the Minister will indicate the priority the Government intend to give that area of research.

<A NAME="51205-03_spnew25"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I should like to follow all noble Lords who have spoken in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, and his committee on this excellent and extremely timely report. I was personally disappointed that I had to stand down as a member of the sub-committee. Reading the evidence taken by the committee and the full report has made me even more aware what a valuable and fascinating inquiry I have missed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para103"></a>The report is as interesting in the indirect light that it throws on the general state of the NHS four years after the so-called reforms were introduced as in its analysis <P>


<a name="column_913"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 913</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the state of medical research, the prime subject of the inquiry. As has already been mentioned, the NHS R&D programme spent its early years in the shadow of health services reorganisation. Given the findings of the report, it is unfortunate that we were not able to discuss it earlier in the year. Six months ago, when the report was first published, your Lordships' House was still considering the Health Authorities Bill, and much of what the noble Lord, Lord Walton, says in his report--and indeed what he proposed in his amendments to that Bill--would have been given extra force if we had considered the Health Authorities Bill and the report at the same time.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para104"></a>The report and all noble Lords who have spoken have rightly paid substantial tribute to the NHS R&D initiative, and particularly to its first director, Professor Sir Michael Peckham. Here I must declare an interest as an original member of the central research and development committee under his chairmanship from 1991 until last December, and I still act as chairman of the North Thames Regional Advisory Committee on Research and Development, where I have the pleasure of working with Professor Andy Haines, who has already been mentioned, and I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, for making his appointment to that position.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para105"></a>My close observation of the programmes as a very lay, lay person has made me a great admirer of their success and, particularly, of the political skill of the directorate in bringing research and development to the top of the NHS agenda. Few people would have predicted when Professor Peckham took up his post five years ago that by now the concept of "evidence based medicine" would have become almost a cliche in research institutions, and at least some NHS management offices, all over the country. As the report says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The strategy receives endorsement from across the spectrum of health care and research". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
However, as the report also emphasises, the energy and enthusiasm of the programme itself and of the academic researchers on whom it crucially depends have often been frustrated by the overall funding and organisational environment in which the programme tries to flower. And--to continue the metaphor--the reforms have provided a pretty unfriendly and stony soil for the new plant to root and develop.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para106"></a>The problems created specifically by the reforms seem to fall into three areas: problems of appropriate research funding and organisation by local trusts and purchasing agencies which are the decision makers in the new NHS; the impact of this fragmentation on getting research into practice--or, as it is known, the GRIPP initiative; and the problems of attracting bright young doctors to academic medical careers when they regard their future as being uncertain. I should like briefly to look at all three.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, has this afternoon described the now accepted proposals of Professor Culyer's Committee on single stream research funding and the hopes that this will give secure financial underpinning for national research. The Culyer scheme is of course, as many speakers have said, designed to <P>


<a name="column_914"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 914</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>counteract the effects of the internal market and its sometimes short-term approach to the contractual basis of healthcare. I join the noble Lord, Lord Walton, in welcoming the creation of a compulsory research levy on all purchasing authorities. However, I remain a little sceptical about the willingness or the capacity of every local agency to fulfill the spirit of the research and development strategy. There still seems to be substantial scope for foot-dragging about both research and development.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para108"></a>I was interested to read the comments of John James, who is himself an NHS chief executive and also a member of the Culyer Committee and the new central research and development committee, who wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of London, referring to his Culyer group,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"all of us were convinced that up and down the country there were macho-purchasers, both districts and fundholders, who blatantly disregarded anything except the most short term considerations. But of course none of us accepted this as a description of ourselves...But no purchaser, however much he or she wants to be on the side of the angels, really knows what impact his or her actions have on activities within a Trust". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para109"></a>It is these hands-off, indirect relationships in the new NHS which raise questions about the long-term, successful implementation of the broad implications of Culyer. I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Walton, reserved the right to revisit this vital issue. The new funding arrangements will need careful monitoring and evaluation. I hope that the Department of Health will play a formal role in that process.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para110"></a>Overall, my main concerns about the continuing success of the R&D programmes are based in my anxieties about that fragmentation of the NHS--the breakdown into several hundred small businesses. Those concerns are made explicit in the report and summarised on page 12, where the committee quotes the Office of Science and Technology in saying:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The importance of the NHS as a test-bed for medical research is vital. By virtue of its national coverage, the NHS is able to provide a broad, well-documented database of patient information and a wide range of patients". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
But the committee goes on to note:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as the NHS R&D Strategy began to take shape, concerns began to be expressed that the NHS reforms...were threatening to break up this vital test-bed. These concerns...echo through our evidence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Those concerns may echo through the evidence, but the committee does not seem to have found anything convincing to dispel them.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para111"></a>The committee has made the important recommendation, already referred to by several noble Lords, that regional research and development directors should have special funds to enable them to cut across local short term market fluctuations in the interest of clinical trials and other research. In the same paragraph, the committee lays stress on the need to take positive steps to educate purchasers, managers and, importantly, lay members of health authorities about the significance of research to developments in patient care. I hope that the Government will take active steps to support those recommendations.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para112"></a>There is, however, a problem about the mechanisms to achieve those and other recommendations in the fragmented health service. The noble Lords, Lord <P>


<a name="column_915"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 915</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Walton and Lord Perry of Walton, specifically referred to those. We on these Benches argued during the passage of the Health Authorities Bill that the abolition of the regional health authorities would substantially weaken the structural links between the NHS and academic medicine. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, proposed amendments to ensure that postgraduate deans would be formally integrated into the regional offices which will succeed the RHAs next April. The Government rejected the amendments and there are now only informal exhortations to executive outposts to keep close to local academics.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para113"></a>The future status of the regional research and development directors, who have been crucial--as was emphasised this afternoon--in building the foundations of the new programmes, is still unclear in the new offices which will be staffed by civil servants.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para114"></a>I note the recommendation at paragraph 4.33. It calls for the establishment of a policy and strategy committee in each region. Members of the committee noted that the strategy committee should be,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"chaired by Regional Chairmen, including within their membership the Postgraduate Dean, the RDRD, the Regional Director of Public Health, and nominees of relevant universities". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I welcome the Government's response: that they want to see such an organisation in place; and the reference in the report to the statement of the Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, at Report stage in your Lordships' House of the Health Authorities Bill that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is nothing to stop regional chairmen within their regions building any mechanisms they wish in order to strengthen those links".--[Official Report, 24/4/95; col. 751.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
However, we need more than permission; we need active involvement in order to get those important mechanisms going. In the absence of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, can give us some insight into the Government's current position on that recommendation.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para115"></a>Several other noble Lords have asked what is happening under the new legislation regarding the proposed regulation that the new health authorities will have a university member where there is a medical school in the area. I understand that although categoric assurances were given during the passage of the Bill, those regulations have neither been consulted on nor published. That is very disturbing.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para116"></a>If a strategic regional committee existed, as the report suggests, and if there were proper medical school representation on the new health authorities, we could be slightly more confident that mechanisms exist not only to oversee and, it is to be hoped, to steer regional programmes, but also to get research into practice and purchasing and to nurture the careers of academic researchers.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para117"></a>Current threats to the careers of academic researchers are given considerable critical attention by the report. They have been given considerable critical attention by noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. As the noble Lord, Lord Walton, said, his committee felt the present situation to be sufficiently serious for it to warrant an immediate separate inquiry. The report <P>


<a name="column_916"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 916</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>speaks of the "uncertainty engendered by the NHS reforms". There are specific concerns about the market system impeding adequate patient flows for research. They are well illustrated by a series of alarming examples on page 34 of the report.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para118"></a>There are concerns about the impact of locally determined pay on academic doctors who may not benefit from that system. Those concerns are echoed by organisations like the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals and the British Medical Association. No wonder, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton, said, the report concludes in this section that the strong disincentives to the bright young doctors of today bode ill for the future of clinical teaching and research and therefore for the future of medicine.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para119"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Walton, I too am glad that the CVCP has set up an independent inquiry in that area but, frankly, regard it almost as a dereliction of duty that the Government have chosen to ignore that recommendation.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para120"></a>Other issues which have been raised this afternoon are equally important. I refer to the balance between biomedical and the health services research; and the distinction between the NHS funded programme and other important sources of finances such as the MRC and the medical charities. My noble friend spoke of the specific problems of Wales. I echo his hope that the research and development director for Wales and for Northern Ireland will be appointed as soon as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para121"></a>In conclusion, I should like once again to thank the noble Lord, Lord Walton, and other Members of your Lordships' House who served on the committee with him. They have provided us with an enormously important document which not only analyses the role and direction of medical research but also gives us the first systematic appraisal of the impact of the NHS reforms on a crucial element in the successful development of our healthcare system.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para122"></a>At the International Conference on the Scientific Basis of Healthcare arranged by Professor Peckham in London this autumn, Mr. Dorrell said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The R&D programme has the potential to make the single biggest contribution to patient care in this country as we approach the next century". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is probably true, but it will only be true if government health policies facilitate rather than impede research and development.

I know that she would have wished to have been here to have heard this excellent debate. I only hope that I can do it justice in her place.

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 917</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interesting debate today but also for his efforts in chairing the committee which produced this valuable report, Medical Research and the NHS Reforms. The Government welcomed the constructive spirit of the report. It congratulated them on the success of the NHS R&D strategy; and the debate today in raising awareness of this strategy has provided its own contribution to one of the key recommendations of the report--namely, that the work of the NHS R&D strategy should be more widely known.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para124"></a>The report covers a wide and complex field and it raises many research and educational issues central to the future delivery of national health services and to the quality of patient care. The Government are quite clear on the importance of this point. We have repeatedly emphasised that research and development is vital to the NHS if the service is to continue to prosper into the new millennium.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para125"></a>This is because R&D provides a crucial link between advances in science and the day-to-day practice of medicine and healthcare. The effectiveness of the service depends on a smooth flow of information, which in turn will help ensure that appropriate, soundly-based decisions are taken throughout the NHS. This role will become even more important as the pace of scientific discovery quickens and the service faces a host of new technologies and procedures.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para126"></a>I am not sure that I understood the point that the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, made with regard to the central initiatives under threat. There is an ambitious programme of centrally funded research which covers all important priority areas--for example, mental health, cancer, primary care and so on. But I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Selborne for his magnanimous comments on the wide-ranging content of the NHS R&D programmes and the supporting information strategy.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para127"></a>We have been reminded today by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, that it was an earlier report from the same committee of this House which acted as the catalyst for government action in this area. It was the recommendations of the report, Priorities in Medical Research (1988), and the exertions of its chairman, the late Lord Nelson of Stafford, which paved the way for the establishment of the NHS R&D strategy and resulted in the appointment of Professor Sir Michael Peckham as the first director of R&D at the Department of Health. My noble friend Lord Selborne paid tribute to Lord Nelson, and we would like to add our tribute to him.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para128"></a>The current report confirms the achievements of the strategy so far, and these have been endorsed across the entire field of healthcare and research, including primary and community care, about which the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, was worried. The centrally funded priority research programmes include primary and community care subjects, and Professor Haines, who was mentioned by my noble friend Lady Gardner, leads the national programme on primary care research. That is a vital recognition of the support that has been won for this relatively new initiative inside and outside the health service. Building on that support will be an essential <P>


<a name="column_918"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 918</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>task in developing the strategy in the years ahead. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, is happy with my response.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para129"></a>The report also paid a generous tribute to Sir Michael Peckham, as did the noble Lords, Lord Walton and Lord Butterfield, and the noble Baroness, Lady Jay. We would also like to pay our tribute to him. After five stirring years, Sir Michael leaves his post in the department at the end of this month. Much has been achieved and the Government and the NHS owe him a great deal, as the findings of the report testify. We were all pleased to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Butterfield, had to say in that respect about Sir Michael. I hope that someone will send him a copy of Hansard so that Lady Peckham may see it.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para130"></a>One sign of his achievement was the great interest shown in the NHS R&D strategy by all the delegates who attended the department's Scientific Basis of Health Services Conference held recently in London. Over 1,100 people from 40 different countries came together over three days to learn and share developments in translating advances in science and research into the best professional practice. The level and enthusiasm of the delegates underlined just how much progress has been made in the past five years. In opening the conference, the Secretary of State took the opportunity to reaffirm the key importance of R&D developments to the NHS both now and in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para131"></a>The Government have actively promoted this recognition of R&D. We are determined that the new NHS should provide the best possible environment in which R&D can flourish. We recognise that an effective R&D strategy is crucial to the new, modern, evidence-based NHS in delivering good and effective care to its patients. We also realise that robust new mechanisms will be needed to provide a strong and durable basis for organising and supporting research within the new NHS. That was why a task force was established under the chairmanship of Professor Anthony Culyer of York University to address those issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para132"></a>Your Lordships' report commended the Government for acknowledging the difficulties for R&D caused by the introduction of the new NHS and for setting up the task force. It also welcomed the task force recommendations and again emphasised the general support of the health service and research communities for the principles underpinning those recommendations. New arrangements for supporting R&D based on those recommendations are now being set in place. They will harness progress in science and address health service issues. In particular, they will provide a sound basis for separately supporting research and patient care while promoting synergy between them. Those plans are of international interest and concern.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para133"></a>As long ago as last April we announced a three-phase plan to implement the report's recommendations and create a single funding stream from an NHS R&D levy on purchasers. Substantial progress has been made since then. The first phase will come into effect next April through the introduction of an interim R&D levy based on existing budgets. In the second phase the initial levy <P>


<a name="column_919"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 919</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be adjusted in April 1997 to reflect the true costs of R&D. Last month guidance was issued to assist NHS hospitals and community health service providers to identify and cost their current R&D programmes as part of a nationwide exercise. Plans for the third phase, the full operation of the arrangements, are on schedule for April 1998.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para134"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Perry of Walton, asked the Government to act soon to allay fears that funding may shift under the new arrangements from support for the science base to needs-led projects. I am pleased to reassure the noble Lord that the new arrangements will include mechanisms for ensuring the correct balance between NHS support for the science base and support for the needs-led work, to which the 1988 report of your Lordships' committee drew attention. The new national forum will play a crucial role in advising them.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para135"></a>I can also reassure the noble Lord, Lord Butterfield, that the new funding arrangements will preserve the current powers of regional directors of research and development to disburse funds for the purposes which he so eloquently described. Regional directors are at present in control of in excess of &#163;35 million.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para136"></a>I should also like to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Walton, in his concern about the schemes in London. As happens elsewhere in the country, those schemes will be able to test for private finance. We expect them to be successful. In the unlikely event of a scheme not attracting a private sector partner, it may still apply for public sector funding, which will continue to be available for priority schemes. I am also grateful to my noble friend Lady Gardner for reminding us of the importance of pre-protocol research. The Government's response to the committee's report confirmed that the new funding arrangements will address that.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para137"></a>I can also reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, that the Government will monitor carefully all three phases of implementation. Regional offices already have teams in place to support and track progress. Evaluating and making the best use of research evidence is central to the aims of the R&D strategy. As with the other programmes, the health technology assessment programme seeks to identify NHS priorities and then to evaluate the effectiveness of current technologies and procedures. The information gained is then shared with the health service.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para138"></a>The Cochrane Centre and the York Centre for reviews and dissemination also play a key role in spreading the word about the state of research knowledge across a range of disciplines. The centres produce information in a form which is relevant and usable, both as an aid to practice and as a way of avoiding unnecessary duplication of research.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para139"></a>Equally, the department's R&D initiative seeks to increase the knowledge base about effectiveness, to make it available to decision makers and to encourage its use to change practice and monitor the results. In health, as in so many other fields, the march of technology gathers pace all the time. Busy clinicians (which of course includes nurses) need to know the results of research in ways which suit their busy <P>


<a name="column_920"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 920</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>schedules and are relevant to the fields in which they practise. I am pleased to tell the noble Baroness, Lady McFarlane of Llandaff, that we have emphasised the important role which general practitioners, nursing staff and professions allied to medicine must play in the development of NHS research. We are developing a research capacity strategy for the NHS which will build on current schemes for research training in the nursing, therapy and pharmacy professions. We will publish a first statement on this strategy at the end of the month. We are very grateful for the views of the noble Baroness, which will help us as we consider future arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para140"></a>Recognising the reservations expressed in the report, we nevertheless take the view that clinical guidelines are one important way of helping to bridge the gap between research and practice. Together with other major initiatives such as clinical audit and education and training, they can help ensure that clinical practice is sufficiently responsive to changing evidence of best practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para141"></a>As the report points out, close links between the NHS and the universities are an important aspect of this development. At the Department of Health, the Steering Group on Undergraduate Medical and Dental Education and Research (SGUMDER) has provided a valuable national forum for identifying and considering such issues, including research. SGUMDER has already produced three reports, including the 10 key principles for effective joint planning and liaison between the universities and the NHS, and a fourth report is imminent.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para142"></a>Partnership and collaboration with other funders of health and medical research are a vital part of our work. Advances in science and technology and the need for health care to adapt to change call for new ways to provide co-operative working between these different funders. This is to avoid the unnecessary duplication of limited resources. This partnership is pursued through the concordats the health departments have concluded with the research councils and through our links with charities and with industry. The newly established national forum chaired by the director of research and development is proof of our commitment to such an approach. I am pleased to tell the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, that the Welsh Office health department expects to announce the appointment of a new director of research and development later this month. We look forward to the new director actively developing and carrying forward the NHS R&D strategy for Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para143"></a>Several noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, referred to the recommendation in the report for an independent review of factors affecting clinical academic recruitment. I had intended to say that I was very pleased to tell the House that the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, after much consideration and informal consultation, has agreed to establish such an inquiry. However, the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, beat me to it. I am sure that all noble Lords were pleased to hear that piece of news.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para144"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, mentioned academic pay. Although it is true that the present mechanism does not enable medical academic pay to be <P>


<a name="column_921"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 921</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increased at the same time as the review body on doctors' and dentists' pay recommendations for National Health Service medical salaries are published, nevertheless, the Government remain committed to the principle of linkage. I hope that that will also reassure the noble Lord, Lord Butterfield.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para145"></a>The CVCP, which will be entirely independent of government, will be chaired by Sir Rex Richards, the former vice-chancellor of Oxford University. The committee hopes to announce the details early in the new year, but in the meantime may I just say that we welcome this development; we regard it as an acceptable way forward and will await the report with interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para146"></a>We welcome the opportunity this debate has given us to consider this report, Medical Research and the NHS Reforms, and to explore the achievements of the NHS R&D strategy and related developments in the Health and Education Departments. The issues raised will be crucial in shaping the agenda for building a stronger NHS underpinned by R&D.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para147"></a>We look forward to building on the partnerships we have already established and to working with others who want to see, and who stand to gain from, the continuing development of R&D within the NHS across the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para148"></a>The Government acknowledge that the rapid advances in basic science and health services research make this an exciting time for researchers and a time of opportunity for government to adapt to the widening scope of modern medicine and develop a health service fit to face the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para149"></a>I thank everyone who contributed to this debate. I am aware that, with the exception of the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, my noble friend Lady Gardner and myself, all noble Lords served on the health committee, as indeed did the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, even if not for the whole time. It is therefore possible that I have not answered in detail all the questions of such high calibre that were put to me. I will read the debate with great care and write to noble Lords, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, with whose points I did not have time to deal at the very end.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-03_spnew27"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, I am deeply grateful to all noble Lords who contributed to the debate. To have chaired this sub-committee of the Committee on Science and Technology of this House was a very rewarding and challenging experience. I am grateful for all the remarks made about my personal contribution to the work of the committee. I also wish to reiterate what I said about the outstanding contribution made by our Clerk and our specialist adviser, Sir Keith Peters, regis Professor of Physics at Cambridge, whose wise and cogent advice throughout the inquiry was so helpful to the committee as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para150"></a>It would, I am sure, be a mistake at this hour to go into detail about the remarks made by so many noble Lords in this challenging and fascinating debate. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Perry of Walton, and to the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, for the way in which they <P>


<a name="column_922"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 922</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>drew attention to the 1988 committee inquiry, so ably chaired by the late Lord Nelson of Stafford, which initiated the very welcome and effective development of research and similar work in the National Health Service. I echo all that was said in congratulating Sir Michael Peckham and his regional directors on their outstanding leadership.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para151"></a>In our report we stressed the crucial importance, as the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, said, of dividing the single stream of funding recommended by Culyer into three streams--the delta, as he referred to it--one of which will support R&D both centrally and regionally, including crucially important locally operated clinical research schemes to enable young doctors and nurses, and others in the community, to take their first steps in research. The second will be the important support for research--biomedical as well as health services research--in our major centres of academic excellence. I wholly agree with the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, on the crucial importance of their preservation and on how important it is to continue to support pre-protocol and curiosity driven research in our NHS. The third component will be support, as many noble Lords suggested, for research in primary care in the community undertaken by nurses and other healthcare professionals, not forgetting the very important contribution to developments and patient care made by scientists without medical qualifications in the NHS.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para152"></a>To respond to the very interesting proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, in my former medical school of Newcastle-upon-Tyne medical students are introduced to patients on their very first day. Every medical student in that school is taken out by a general practitioner in the first week and introduced to a family in the community whom he or she is expected to follow throughout the entire medical course, writing reports first on their social background and subsequently on their medical problems. Students do that while they are studying the basic medical sciences. So many of the ideas to which the noble Lord referred are already being implemented in a number of medical schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para153"></a>In a very cogent and detailed speech, the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, pointed out how important it is to maintain the close relationship between the universities and the NHS upon which so much of the work referred to in today's debate depends. I was delighted to hear the Minister state that this was the cornerstone of the Government's policy. We look forward to hearing more about the regulations relating to university membership of health authorities and to whether this government proposal, accepted in their response to our report, will allow regional committees of the type that we envisage in our report to be established. We shall be interested to hear whether it will be a firm government recommendation.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para154"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, said, the NHS is the test bed for medical research, a test bed which must be preserved. I was glad to hear that the levy will be in partial operation in April next year, will come into full operation in April 1997 and will be in absolutely final full operation in 1998. That is very good news. I have no doubt that the work of the implementation groups of <P>


<a name="column_923"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 923</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which we have heard will be monitored closely by your Lordships' Select Committee on Science and Technology under the leadership of the noble Earl, Lord Selborne. It is very important that that committee will continue to monitor the way in which the report is implemented by government. There is much more that we shall wish to learn over the coming months.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-03_para155"></a>The contribution to medical care of research and development and of clinical academics nationally and locally is incalculable and will always be so in the future of the NHS. This has been a most encouraging debate. Many other points could have been raised but I hope that note will have been taken of this matter. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, it is crucially important that the Government's welcome for work on its NHS R&D strategy should become more widely known, not just in the academic and NHS community but by the public at large.

<P>
<A NAME="51205-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Allen of Abbeydale </B>   rose to move to resolve, That this House calls on Her Majesty's Government, following the implementation of the Probation (Amendment) Rules 1995, to ensure that the proposed higher education element of the required training of probation officers will lead to a professional qualification which is of a high standard and is subject to external validation.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the probation service of England and Wales is quite small--there are roughly some 8,000 qualified staff in all--but it forms a crucial element in our criminal justice system. Its functions are wide-ranging, sensitive and sometimes dangerous. The Home Office fully recognises the need for training new recruits but the question is whether the arrangements which are being proposed to that end fall short of what is needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para1"></a>There are two preliminary points that I ought to make. The first is to emphasise that the terms of the Motion are so drawn as not to involve any challenge to the amending Probation Rules recently made by the Home Secretary. The second is that I am well aware that there is pending before the courts a judicial review of whether the Home Secretary was acting within his statutory powers when making those rules. I shall be careful not to comment on that aspect.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para2"></a>Although today I want to look to the future, I must say a few words to explain how we have reached our present predicament. In 1994 a Civil Service review of recruitment and qualifying training recognised the merits of the service and its success in recruiting mature people with a wide breadth of experience. Nonetheless, it recommended ending the requirement in the Probation Rules that an essential qualification was the two-year diploma in social work or its equivalent. The Home Secretary liked the look of that recommendation as a means of widening the field of recruitment and issued a <P>


<a name="column_924"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 924</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consultative document proposing that that diploma requirement should be scrapped and training put in the hands of the service itself. A slightly unusual feature was that the universities concerned were told at the beginning rather than the end of the consultation period that the sponsoring of new students was to cease.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para3"></a>It turned out that the vast majority of those consulted were against the proposal to rescind the requirement for a professional qualification. Nevertheless, the Government decided to go ahead. I simply record the fact, without comment, in view of what I said at the beginning, that the amending Probation Rules which came into force only yesterday delete the paragraph dealing with the diploma qualification.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para4"></a>Although the rules themselves, therefore, are now silent on the need for any qualification, it is only fair to say that the Home Office decision document underlines the need for training. It contemplates that it should be the responsibility of each authority and carried out mainly within the service; that an NVQ (National Vocational Qualification) should be worked up at the appropriate level--I understand that it is level 4; and, which is important, that training should be supplemented as necessary by:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"probation-specific learning modules provided by higher education institutions". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I am particularly proud of the way in which my old department is keeping up with modern events. We never wrote English like that in my time. I hope that it is not too uncharitable to describe all this as a kind of local pick-and-mix approach at A-level standard. There is a widely held view that all that is not enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para5"></a>At this stage it is perhaps fitting to recall some of the aspects of human behaviour with which probation officers have to cope. They provide pre-sentence reports to help the courts in the sentencing process and they would soon lose the confidence of the courts if those reports were not consistently of high quality. They supervise people on parole or supervision orders--180,000 of them this year. They help people released on bail. They staff probation centres and bail hostels. This year they have prepared some 35,000 family court welfare reports. The people they deal with can be children, drug takers, alcoholics, mentally ill, homeless and sometimes the victims themselves of crimes.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para6"></a>The idea that those responsibilities can best be discharged, after a comparatively short period of local training, by someone such as an ex-Army officer who is used to discipline and will not stand any nonsense--that has been implied in some of the press comments--takes a bit of swallowing. So far as I can gather, it is not a view which is shared by the probation officers who were themselves formerly in the services, the police or the prison service and found out how much they had to learn.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para7"></a>Probation officers not only have to know about legislation in the fields of criminal justice, children, mental health and so on; they have to cope with damaged individuals in a wide variety of circumstances. To that end they need to be schooled in the thinking and research into problems of human behaviour which take place at university level. As it happens, such thinking <P>


<a name="column_925"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 925</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and research is at a very high level in this country. It requires skill and knowledge, for example, to assess why an individual has got into trouble and what can best be planned for that person's future, or to advise on the right course for an offender suffering from mental illness.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para8"></a>As I said, the Home Office recognises that there might be a higher education element in training, possibly in most cases, but it is not obligatory. Although the decision paper is not altogether consistent in its various references to higher education, the Home Office seems to envisage it as, at best, playing only a comparatively minor part. Nor is it simply a matter of the content of a course of training. The considerations I outlined add up to a powerful case for a nationally accepted professional qualification, based on higher education, common to all members of the service and externally validated. An NVQ is simply not the answer. Without such a professional qualification I see a number of hazards.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para9"></a>First, this small service, this profession, would be fragmented with no common standards. One authority could well refuse to admit the qualifications accepted by its neighbour. Secondly, far from opening the door for the first time to able and suitable recruits, as the decision paper seems to imply, the likelihood is that the good entrant would be discouraged and would look for employment elsewhere in a post with a higher professional status.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para10"></a>Thirdly, the lowering of standards could hardly fail to increase the risk of something going wrong and thus put the public more at risk. At a time when other professions are seeking to enhance the status and qualifications of their members, the probation service would be seen to be going in exactly the opposite direction. That cannot be right.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para11"></a>There is much else that one could say about the probation service. And though the question contained in the Motion is simple and straightforward, it is nevertheless important. It asks the Government to say whether or not they agree in principle that there should be introduced a professional qualification for probation officers based on higher education and externally validated. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para12"></a>Moved to resolve, That this House calls on Her Majesty's Government, following the implementation of the Probation (Amendment) Rules 1995, to ensure that the proposed higher education element of the required training of probation officers will lead to a professional qualification which is of a high standard and is subject to external validation.--(Lord Allen of Abbeydale.)

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carr of Hadley: </B>   My Lords, I strongly support the Motion moved by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, and all the arguments he raised. For the sake of brevity, I shall not repeat his arguments but I strongly agree with the points that he made.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para13"></a>I wish to stress to the Minister that the Motion is narrow. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, also made that point. It does not attempt to open up the Home Secretary's recent basic changes in the probation <P>


<a name="column_926"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 926</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>service. It does not challenge the new principle that recruitment to the probation service in the future will not require any prior academic qualifications. It therefore does not challenge the concept that from now on probation officer training will take place after rather than before recruitment. We are therefore talking of a narrow, but immensely important point.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para14"></a>The Motion concentrates on one specific aspect of in-service training which is to be established. The Home Secretary's document, as the noble Lord, Lord Allen, mentioned, envisages the availability of some courses at higher education level. He expresses doubt, which I share, about the clarity of what already exists. But the Motion envisages higher education playing a part in training.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para15"></a>The Motion concerns two aspects. First, it says that the higher education element already proposed should be so structured and organised and of sufficient scale that it can lead to a high-standard professional qualification. We believe that that is right and necessary for the future standards and effectiveness of the probation service throughout the country. That is surely desirable also for the good morale of the probation service and for it to continue to be seen as an attractive career of high satisfaction to potential entrants of all ages.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para16"></a>We must not underestimate the influence of modern trends for more training--we should welcome them in this country--for people entering a profession, especially if they feel that they are entering a profession which is deprofessionalising qualifications at a time when most other areas of activity are upgrading them. This is of immense importance to the future recruitment to the service of people of all ages. I do not dissent from the Home Secretary's wish for the service to attract people of all ages so that people on second careers can join the service. That is presently happening, but the more it happens, the better.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para17"></a>Secondly, the Motion asks that the high standard of qualification of which I spoke should be subject to external validation and not simply be approved by the probation service employers. External validation provides the touchstone of professional status wherever we look in the area of employment. The emphasis on professional status is not just to boost the ego of the service, desirable though that may be; above all, it is to ensure that the service provides the competence, the depth of knowledge and the maturity of outlook needed if it is to fulfill its important role within our criminal justice system. The service must be equally strong throughout the country and not, as the noble Lord said, run into the danger of fragmentation and unevenness of quality from one part to another.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para18"></a>My final point concerns the fact that that view is held not just by the probation service and those who know a lot about it; it is held equally strongly by the employers. A note I received recently--as I suspect did other noble Lords--from the central probation council, stresses the need for a national professional qualification.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para19"></a>That is what the Motion seeks and it is an important request. I urge the Minister not to turn down that request this evening. I hope that the Government will accept it. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>However, if my noble friend has not had the chance to consider the matter with sufficient care today, I hope that she will leave the door wide open so that it can be considered with a view to trying to knock it into shape in order to maintain the high professional reputation and status of the probation service for the future. That is important not just for the well being of the probation service, but also for the well being of our whole criminal justice system so that the probation service can play the vital part that it needs to play--not all members of the public realise this--in protecting the public from the crimes from which we suffer at the moment.

<A NAME="51205-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Merlyn-Rees: </B>   My Lords, I learnt the value of the probation service principally, not as Home Secretary when I was responsible for it, but as a Member of Parliament for an inner city area in Leeds in Yorkshire. I know it also because for many years my wife was a magistrate in the London area and the chairman of the Bench for a long period. I learnt from her, when she talked at home about the cases that she had encountered that day, the value of the probation service.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para20"></a>I compliment the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, on allowing us to discuss this matter this evening. Time is of the essence and I shall therefore go directly to two points in the Motion. The first concerns the high standard of professional qualifications. The noble Lord, Lord Carr, raised the point of professional qualifications. The development of the professions over the years is vital. I know the argument that perhaps the professions do not know enough about grass-roots problems, but the two go together. Training and professional qualifications go together.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para21"></a>The Motion refers to a professional qualification which is of a high standard and which is subject to external validation. We may have spoken in vain against the Government on their original proposals, but measurements and tables are part of the life blood of government policy in other fields, so perhaps we may not be asking in vain when we ask for high standards in a professional qualification and external validation.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para22"></a> I thought that the best way I could approach the debate was to take the list which was provided by the Home Office of the main features of the new scheme. How do the main features of the new scheme measure up to the two criteria which are raised in the Motion? The list states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Prospective probation officers will be recruited as salaried trainees". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
How will that be done? How will a judgment be made that a young man or a young woman is suitable to be a probation officer? I understand that it is to be done regionally. How will it be done? I am thinking of the headquarters of the West Yorkshire Probation Service. Will it work with Lancashire? Will there be new regions? On what basis will the recruitment take place?
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para23"></a> The list also states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Individually assessed training will take place mainly in the service". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_928"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 928</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
How will it be correlated? Will people have an afternoon off a week? Sometimes when I go to a bank I see that the staff are having two hours off in the morning for training. Is that what will happen in the probation service? Will the probation office be shut in the morning while training takes place? Where will it take place? We are told that it will be technical learning with understanding of relevant procedures. That is straightforward. It is the kind of thing we used to do in the services--a trade test on how to dismantle a gun. If you did not get 95 out of 100 you were doing very badly. I often found that the cleverer ones who had university degrees were not as good at dismantling the gun as those who had left school at 14. But that is another matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para24"></a>We are told that there will be,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"training which will be supplemented, as necessary, by dedicated probation courses at higher education institutions". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Have the higher education institutions been asked about this? What do they say? Will they run courses on a yearly basis or on a term basis simply for probation officers, or will other social science candidates at the higher education institution come in to be taught as well? We are told that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"all such courses must meet an approved specification". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Who will draw up the specification? Will it be the colleges of higher education or the higher education institutions? Will it have a syllabus in the university book.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para25"></a> We are told:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Once appointed, probation officers should have access to a range of vocational or academic qualifications which are relevant to their work". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I find that fairly vague. Where do the standards come in? Where is the validation between one institute and another, or will we find that taking a course at one institution is easier than taking a course at another institution? There is no professional qualification. Will there be qualified, validating examiners? We are further told:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"All assessments will be quality controlled by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
which will have to have a department in its office to quality control the courses in different parts of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para26"></a>The list then refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"competence as a probation officer". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
This is the young man or young woman who goes around the backs of houses, knocks and wants to talk to Bill, Pete or Sarah. One cannot measure that qualification. What is important is how they get on with the people concerned. It is an art, not a science. It is not a very pleasant job. You have to do it in the evenings, often on a winter's night. Competence as a probation officer should be recognised not only by the reward of qualified probation officer status. One can imagine asking, "What are your qualifications?", and being told, "I am a QPOS".
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para27"></a>I went to the Library and photostatted a document which describes what goes on in the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, which was set up nine <P>


<a name="column_929"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 929</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>years ago by the Government following a White Paper on education and training. I know of the NCVQ because of the work it does in management, which is very good. The work it does for supervisory management is first class. I have come across it before. But it is an administrative body. The document states that it is,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"sponsored jointly by employment and education for Northern Ireland and for Wales and reports to the Secretary of State for Employment for administrative purposes". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It does not do so for professional purposes. How will it fit in with the Government's scheme? I am concerned not that we lost the last battle but that we can now influence the Government to think about standards, high qualifications and external validation. It is the most we are able to do. We have lost a major battle but perhaps we can win an important battle if we influence the Government today.

<A NAME="51205-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henniker: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Allen, for initiating this debate because it gives me a chance to pay tribute to the probation service. I have had a rather odd and motley career but at the end of it I have seen a lot of the probation service. I spent a whole decade of my life looking after and training members of the diplomatic service. I see, strangely enough, great resemblances between what the diplomatic service is asked to do and what the probation service is asked to do. They are asked to do a variety of things. In the diplomatic service one can one day be repatriating a drunken seaman and the next day negotiating a treaty. A probation officer looks after someone who is dangerous and has some malady which can hardly be diagnosed. He has to rely on his own wits. I wish to say how grateful I am to the probation service and how much I believe in what the noble Lord, Lord Allen, is asking us to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para28"></a>Over the past few years I have seen a lot of the probation service. I have worked with the Parole Board and I have worked in prisons. I was chairman of the Intermediate Treatment Fund by which we tried to devise demanding schemes in order to lead young people away from crime. I have become a local Suffolk man and I have also started various things with the probation service, which has its fingers in every pie. One of the things which most impresses me about the probation service is the young probation officer. I have seen a lot of them. They are deeply dedicated to what they do. In that they resemble young diplomats. They are deeply dedicated and deeply believing in the value of what they do.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para29"></a> When I first came out of the diplomatic service and went to work in charities in London I remember meeting a young probation officer in a sticky patch of London. I asked him why he was there. He had been an officer in what I consider is the best regiment in the British Army. He said that he had looked around very carefully to see what he could do as another job. He was just the kind of young man for whom I would imagine the Home Secretary is now looking. He said that he had looked around and that the probation service seemed to him to be top of the list. He was not disappointed.
<P>


<a name="column_930"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para30"></a>Probation officers have an enormous amount of responsibility. There is an element of danger in whatever they do. They take absolute responsibility for what they are given to do. Once they are trained they are given total responsibility for looking after their clients. That can lead anywhere. The probation officer has to be careful because if he makes a mistake it is not only obvious but sometimes disastrous.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para31"></a>Therefore, I suggest that we look very carefully at the pleas of the noble Lord, Lord Allen, and the noble Lord, Lord Carr, who is also now president of an organisation which I once served, the Rainer Foundation, the original founder of which is alleged to have been a founder of the probation service. That has also given me a stronger feeling of involvement in the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para32"></a>I commend what the noble Lord, Lord Allen, has said and thank him for doing so. I spoke about the young man whom I met in Peckham and who said how much he enjoyed the probation service. He said that he would not have come into the service unless it had had a high standard of professionalism. He certainly made that clear. I am sure that he will find, as I found when I was trying to train people at the Foreign Office, that people will not come unless they are given the chance to develop themselves in many ways which they may not have had the opportunity to do at school, perhaps even starting over again and getting further and higher training of an academic standard. I very much commend to your Lordships the pleas made by the noble Lords, Lord Allen and Lord Carr.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-04_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Runciman of Doxford: </B>   My Lords, I should like also to express my strong support of this Motion. I do so on the basis of only a little direct, but also some indirect, experience of the issues which are involved. As speakers have already brought out quite sufficiently, the importance of the work done by probation officers is not in dispute. Although the probation service did not come directly within the remit of the Royal Commission on criminal justice in England and Wales, my colleagues and I did see and hear enough of the work which probation officers do both inside and outside prisons, to be left in no doubt of its importance and value. It also seems to me no less obvious, as eloquently argued by the noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, that their qualification should be externally validated.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para33"></a>But the supporters of the Motion, need at least to acknowledge that there are two arguments which might be put on the other side, even if only to discard them. The first of these is the risk of what is sometimes called "credentialism" or, less euphemistically, the "creeping diploma disease". It does exist and it is not a purely imaginary ailment in educational and institutional life. It is possible that the self-perpetuating quest for increasingly high levels of formal qualification can lead to an effective debasement of the intellectual and professional currency. It can waste resources and can merely recreate in a new guise the basic problem of attracting, selecting and training for a profession those who will turn out to practise it best.
<P>


<a name="column_931"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 931</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para34"></a>The other argument, which should not be dismissed out of hand, is that for some occupations the best training is on the job. Nobody disputes that doctors, solicitors and architects need formal as well as practical training, but it is not perhaps equally self-evident that, for example, future heads of business corporations need diplomas in management studies or that future Ministers of the Crown or senior civil servants need degrees in political and social science. In that context, and very much in parenthesis, your Lordships might be mildly amused to learn that the Home Secretary, as an undergraduate and reading Part II of the economics tripos at the University of Cambridge, was sent to me by his supervisor to write two essays on sociological topics. I do not remember what topics I set, neither do I remember what I thought of his performance. In any case, I should like to disclaim any responsibility, whether for good or ill, for his subsequent career.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para35"></a>That is very much by the way, but having stated the only two arguments, which I believe can be put against the thinking which underlies this Motion, which I thoroughly support, I believe that they can both be dismissed because, as the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, brought out, a qualified probation officer needs to be well versed in a broad range of subjects and topics from the law and the criminal justice system itself through to the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness; the effects of both physical and emotional deprivation on patterns of offending behaviour; the psychology of recidivism and the impact of prison on family relationships.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para36"></a>If someone says in argument against that that these are matters not of exact science or scholarship and that one cannot teach budding probation officers about these things in the way that one can teach architects mathematics or engineering or material science, my answer is that that is true, but that is all the more reason why recruits to the probation service should have been taught--and they can only be taught formally--what is and also what is not precisely known in, for example, the field of current criminology; what can and what cannot be relied on about the statistics for drug and alcohol abuse and whether or not they license an inference to an established trend; what indeed is the present state of research on child development and adolescent behaviour; and what can and cannot be learnt in advance about interviewing techniques. As regards learning on the job, let us all remember that all too often that can be at the expense of the client who is on the receiving end.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para37"></a>I do not want to go so far as to lay down what ought to be in the ideal curriculum because I would not be competent to do so, and neither do I know whether it should be by way of a diploma or something else. But that there needs to be a diploma, degree or some equivalent qualification as much as for the grizzled second careerist from the armed services as for the starry-eyed young from school, seems to me to be wholly incontestable.

<A NAME="51205-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the Motion moved by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para38"></a>My noble friend Lady Blatch, for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration, generously gave me an hour of her time to explain the proposed new arrangements for probation training and recruitment. Alas, despite her very persuasive powers, on professional grounds I feel unable to accept them. I cannot agree with Her Majesty's Government as regards the recommended new format for training.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para39"></a>The questions to be asked, as many of your Lordships have done, are these: will the probation officers of the future have a professional qualification? Will not the probation service be out of line with other services with which it must work, notably the legal services and the social work services? Will not the new arrangements for the probation service be going in the opposite direction from that of the social work services with which it has to work so closely? Is it appreciated by the Home Office that in England and Northern Ireland there are 10 training courses for a degree in social work? Probation work includes the diploma in social work. Ten per cent. of the students training as social workers and probation officers are taking degree courses. There are already 1,000 students at any one time on a three or four-year course, and of these 300 are training as probation officers. Last year the Higher Education Council inspected 76 programmes in England and Northern Ireland, 16 of which had an excellent rating. Of those, there were 13 courses which had probation officer students.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para40"></a>The point in giving these figures is to indicate that social work training is moving in one direction--that is, towards the three-year degree course--while the probation service seems to be moving away from that.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para41"></a>The probation service is held in high regard in this country. It seems to many of us that it is now being downgraded. It is said that it would be possible to take a modular course at some university or other, and probably a university where officers would have trained on a full-time basis. When working at Oxford we arranged for a two-year course for people coming out of the services and for women whose children had grown up. They did a two-year course. They were 35 years of age and over. They were invaluable. They said that they were grateful to have had a two-year course at a university prior to taking up the work, which they were going to do, both in the probation service and in social work. I hope that we are not going to divide those who work in the same field but who are perhaps different ages.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para42"></a>The co-operation that exists between social workers and probation officers is invaluable to society. It is a great necessity. It would be a sad and sorry state of affairs if social workers are now to undertake a three-year degree course whereas probation officers will have only a modular course or perhaps even less than that.

<P>
<A NAME="51205-04_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My Lords, I begin by paying tribute to the probation officers I have known in the past 40 years. As a very young, naive police officer, it was the probation officers at Clerkenwell Court who taught me to see human beings as rather more complex than I thought that they were previously. Over the years since, I have been closely associated with probation officers both professionally and at conferences. I must have met many hundreds of probation officers on many occasions, all of whom I found knowledgeable about human behaviour, sophisticated, tough minded and with a balanced view of their work.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para43"></a>Therefore, I cannot understand why the Home Secretary intends to remove the necessary underpinning of knowledge which goes with their everyday experience of human behaviour. As the noble Lord, Lord Henniker, said, there seems to be an attempt to deprofessionalise probation officers. The excuse that not enough older recruits apply under the present system is clearly disproved by the fact that 30 per cent. of the current intake are over 30, with something like 23 per cent. being over 40.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para44"></a>Many enter the service from other careers and with wide experience of human behaviour. Clearly, they have opportunities to learn from day-to-day experience, but they also need knowledge which can be gained only at the highest levels in higher institutions. It is essential that they have a background in psychology and in the development of human behaviour. They need to know about the law, procedures and criminology. I speak as someone who has two degrees in psychology and two diplomas and I have found that, although those qualifications do not necessarily provide me with answers about why human beings behave as they do, they destroy false assumptions and provide breadth, balance and an understanding of statistics and trends. They destroy one's simple assumptions about human behaviour.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para45"></a>It seems to me that the Home Secretary must be operating from a very simple model of human behaviour. I sometimes wonder whether too much exposure to the law, which provides manmade rules, makes people assume certain things about human behaviour. They then seem to think that people can be dealt with on a black/white, yes/no model, with the view being taken that you simply press a button and they will behave in a certain way. That seems to be what is happening with the probation service. There seems to be the assumption that probation officers have a simple job to do which can be learnt from everyday experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para46"></a>What the Home Secretary is proposing is a system of training which used to be called "sitting by Nellie", which has been widely disproved as inappropriate because you learn from other people's bad behaviour just as much as from their good behaviour. You cannot guarantee that the Nellie you are sitting beside operates according to best practice. Therefore, it is essential to have a framework of professional knowledge, academic discipline and the subjects which I have already outlined.
<P>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 934</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para47"></a>The proposals represent a downgrading in the position of probation officers vis-o-vis other professions. A large proportion of police officers nowadays have degrees. Social workers have degrees or at least higher education diplomas. To downgrade probation officers in the way that is proposed would be extremely sad. It would be a disaster not only for the profession, but for the future prospects of the offenders with whom probation officers have to deal.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para48"></a>We live in an increasingly sophisticated world in which we all need more knowledge and better qualifications to underpin the jobs that we do. Probation officers in particular have extremely demanding jobs and, without the breadth and framework of academic knowledge to provide a balance about the world and human behaviour, I do not think that they can carry out their duties effectively.

<P>
<A NAME="51205-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bancroft: </B>   My Lords, it is always a daunting privilege to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, which seems to be my fate. I support the Motion and the powerful speeches which have been made in its favour, especially by my noble friend Lord Allen of Abbeydale. Like him, I am temperamentally inclined towards understatement, so it gives me no pleasure at all to say that for connoisseurs of effrontery this perverse operation to deskill and deprofessionalise the probation service wins a medal. It was a done deal from the start when the two junior Home Office officials were handed skewed terms of reference. It was a done deal to the end when the consultation process turned out to be a sham.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para49"></a>However, we must look on the bright side. As other noble Lords have said, there are elements in the Home Office paper which can be looked on constructively and with good faith and goodwill all round. We must not miss this opportunity to create a new and even more relevant diploma or equivalent, obtainable by a variety of different routes, based in higher education and externally validated. A scheme on those broad lines which we all know--and the Minister knows--is acceptable to all probation service employers could be drawn up in short order. There have been ample analyses of probation officer training and qualifications. Virtually all of the necessary building blocks are already in place. I look forward with confidence to the Minister's response, giving us, with her usual courtesy, an unequivocal undertaking to accept the Motion.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para50"></a>Like the noble Viscount, Lord Runciman, I am no follower of what I believe he called the "accreditisation drift", but I end by reminding the Minister that even under the old dispensation, out of 10 states surveyed, England and Wales ranked only eighth in terms of the educational level of probation officers. The two countries below us were the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. That information comes from a newly published book with which the Minister will be familiar. It is an authoritative publication about probation around the world. One of the two co-signatories to the preface is the director of <P>


<a name="column_935"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 935</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>research and statistics in her own department. Under the new dispensation, this country is in due course bound for a position below the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. It is for us here tonight to resolve that this country needs and deserves a probation service which is more, rather than less, professional.

<A NAME="51205-04_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to detain your Lordships, but I should like strongly to support the Motion moved by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. I am particularly interested that his views have the support of the employers, the councils, and a large body of our probation officers.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para51"></a>As many noble Lords have said, the directives run counter to the trend in similar professions which demand a higher degree of qualification from their personnel to cope with the increasing complexity of the problems and challenges facing this and similar services. For a start, the reduced budget for the probation service may well result in a reduction in numbers, thus placing greater demands, both intellectual and practical, on a smaller number of officers. There is also the matter of public confidence in the service which cannot but be affected by the proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para52"></a>The argument has been advanced by the Government that, because social workers do not need an outside degree, why should the probation service? I emphasise that the central council is flexible about it. The courses could avoid the nomenclature "social service" and the majority of the universities have, at the request of the service, provided greater in-service experience as part of their course. Perhaps that addresses a point raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Runciman.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para53"></a>The Minister is rightly concerned that the probation service should be open to as wide a spectrum of suitable candidates as possible. I appreciate that and it is of course wholly to be welcomed, but it is significant that one county probation service with which I am familiar has approximately 230 officers. Of those, 25 were recruited over the age of 30. Several of them have categorically told the chairman that they could not conceive how they could possibly manage to do their job effectively without the specialised two-year course.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para54"></a>The challenge facing the service is of ever greater complexity of problems and, in not a few cases, personal danger also. The NVQ is just not enough by itself. I am persuaded that the service is flexible in attempting to meet the Government's wish for a broader entry, but from these Benches I once again urge my noble friend the Minister to recognise, at this late stage, that the external, independently validated qualification must remain the core of the training and education for probation officers. It is its standing with the public and other court bodies, particularly the family courts, which is at risk for what is and must remain a key service.

<FONT SIZE=3>Abbeydale, and commend it to the House. We are indebted to him for these constructive proposals which he outlined admirably in his opening speech.

<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para55"></a>When we discussed these matters in April during a debate which I was privileged to lead, I hope that I may suggest, without a charge of undue arrogance being levelled against me, that we had the better of the argument. Indeed, save for the government speaker, only one of the 18 noble Lords who took part supported the government proposals.

<A NAME = "51205-04_para56"></a>But all that is water under the bridge, and I was grateful when the Minister, with her customary courtesy, sent me, and no doubt others, news of the Government's intentions in early October. In its decision paper the Home Office stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"During the consultation period which ended on 26th May almost 500 responses had been received from a wide variety of sources including Probation Services and Committees, Universities, members of the Magistracy and Judiciary". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It continued:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"All of these comments were carefully considered and taken into account". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para57"></a>In view of the fact that the government stance did not change at all as a result of that trawl, it is perhaps hardly surprising that they omitted to mention that nearly 98 per cent. of the 500 respondees were against the proposals in one way or another, making those of a cynical disposition wonder--no doubt unworthily--why the exercise had been mounted in the first place. Nevertheless, I hope that it may be possible to put in place constructive proposals which will meet the reasonable anxieties of all who work in and with the probation service.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para58"></a>I have to say that I do not believe that that can be done without some form of higher education being put in place, leading to a qualification which is seen to be at least as desirable as the present Diploma in Social Work, and one furthermore which is--this is crucial, as noble Lords have already said--externally validated. In that context, I cannot for the life of me see why among the various options open the Minister cannot, as it were, take a dip or, to put it more seriously, advocate the adoption of a diploma in probation studies, the courses to be constructed and administered by appropriate universities or colleges of higher education.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para59"></a>The current ties between universities and the service are cherished and are of particular value in, for example, Welsh- speaking areas such as those served by the University of Wales in Bangor which supplies many Welsh-speaking probation officers to the service. It would indeed be a step backwards to stop mining that valuable and important seam.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para60"></a>I should like at this point to stress that I am not opposed to the concept of a fast-track entry for mature applicants, even though the statistics show that the majority of applicants coming to the service at present are mature, and that under the existing system it is, alas, impossible to accommodate all successful candidates. <P>


<a name="column_937"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 937</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I believe that at present only half of those who have recently succeeded in the course can be accommodated in posts. It may of course be that the Government intend to increase funding for the service, not just to create those extra posts but to take account of the likely increased cost of fragmented local training. I hope that that may indeed be the case, but we had no clue to that in the recent Budget.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para61"></a>Let me pose this question: why should those young people honourably seeking a career in what is a very demanding but at the same time rewarding vocation be fobbed off with piecemeal training which will inevitably differ from one area to another in terms of competence and skill and which will end with a qualification which will almost certainly be perceived as being worse than anything on offer today? What I fear will happen is what always happens in such circumstances. Recruits will vote with their feet and march into other disciplines at a time when, because of the inexorable rise in crime, the need in the probation service for men and women of quality will never have been so marked.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para62"></a>I do not intend to rake over the embers again today, but let me just say that, unlike the editors of certain tabloid newspapers or many of those party activists who attend party conferences, I have been a magistrate for over 20 years and therefore am someone who has been in close contact with the probation service over that time. I know what a vital role the service plays in the administration of the criminal justice system; I know how important it is that its members receive exhaustive and skilled training from a wide variety of disciplines, not just for the correct administration of justice but for their own and our safety; I know from personal experience how professional they are and how seriously they take their responsibilities. Finally, I know that not to take those factors into consideration when finalising the training proposals may have serious future implications on the effective work of the courts and on the morale of the service.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para63"></a>Accordingly, I beg the Minister to have an open mind on the issue and at the least to incorporate in any future arrangements made for the training of probation officers the two principles contained in the Motion.

<A NAME="51205-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, the proposal to amend the probation rules to rescind the requirement for a probation officer to hold a Diploma in Social Work needs to be put into a wider perspective. Probation officers do a wide range of jobs associated with reducing crime. Their day-to-day work brings them into contact with the widest range of social problems. They deal with child abuse, mental illness problems, personality disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, and marital and family problems. All those situations need not only careful handling but sophisticated analytic and diagnostic techniques.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para64"></a>Probation officers are not merely expected to recognise signs of unusual behaviour but have to make judgments as to how they may be handled. Dealing with <P>


<a name="column_938"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 938</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those difficult situations requires links with other agencies such as health and social services. It follows that probation officers need to have the skills and abilities to link with medical staff in defining risk assessment at a variety of levels. They may need to decide about a florid schizophrenic needing hospital care, or, at the other end of the spectrum, to supervise in the community someone who is released from a secure unit.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para65"></a>Probation officers are also working as family court welfare officers. They have a crucial role to play in advising family courts, assessing family relationships, working with and managing risk to children, and mediating and helping separating and divorcing parents to formulate agreements in the best interests of the children. Those are just some of the skills probation officers need in their day-to-day duties. The idea that they can just be skills acquired on the job, as it were, would be to deny the sophistication needed in these complex situations.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para66"></a>If there is concern about the suitability of the existing qualification in social work, then let the opportunity be taken for probation officers to acquire skills suitable to their role in the criminal justice system, while recognising the sophistication that is required of them to do the job effectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para67"></a>The country is proud of its academic achievements and the products of our education system are demonstrated in every avenue of public, commercial and industrial life. In every sector there would be cries that the highest quality staff are needed in order to do the job successfully. The world of the probation officer still needs to be formed of this excellence. It is therefore essential that the training of probation officers is maintained at a high standard. There is a necessity in higher education for a way that leads to a professional externally validated qualification. By holding on to this aspiration we are safeguarding the standards in an important part of our criminal justice system. I was sorry to hear the words of the noble Lord, Lord Bancroft. Another view is that, as with other parts of the system, our probation service has become a yardstick for performance throughout the world and it is important that this reputation is not lost.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="51205-04_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Walpole: </B>   My Lords, I shall be extremely brief. I speak as a magistrate who has sat for many years on a small local Bench and I have a high regard for the probation service. I have a daughter who is a fully qualified probation officer in south-west London.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para68"></a>I wholeheartedly agree with my noble friend Lord Allen of Abbeydale, who introduced the Motion so completely. There seems to be little more to say except that it is important that when any forms of qualifications are validated they must be of the same even high quality wherever they are obtained. Furthermore, they must be of sufficient quality to be recognised not only anywhere in this country but also in those parts of Europe where there is a probation service and in the Commonwealth countries which have the same type of judicial system as ours; notably, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para69"></a>It is ironic that, while other professional bodies in this country are seeking to obtain such transferable qualifications, the Government, by not funding the <P>

<P>
<A NAME="51205-04_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, when in April we debated the probation service on a Motion tabled by the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, the House was almost unanimous in its view about the Government's then proposals. With one exception out of 18, the House took the view that the Government's proposals were wrong. All 12 speakers today have been critical of the Government's proposals, and most importantly, supportive of the Motion before the House today.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para70"></a>In April the debate was wound up by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, deputising for the Minister. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In recent years the probation service has ... changed from being a social work agency to being a criminal justice organisation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He also said that changes to probation service training were part of:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a series of proposals which aim to bring the service more into line with the proper expectations of the courts and of the public".--[Official Report, 5/4/95; col. 236.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para71"></a>He gave no evidence that the courts and the public were asking for change or had expressed strong views that the service fell below expectations. On that occasion we had the sense that the energy for change had come entirely from within the Home Office.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para72"></a>The noble Earl referred to the Dews report, which has been mentioned today, as the starting point for the process which led to the order made yesterday. He said that among the important weaknesses that the Dews report had discovered in the present system was that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the statutory requirement for the Diploma in Social Work inhibits the recruitment of many potentially valuable recruits".--[Official Report, 5/4/95; col. 239.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It is interesting that in today's debate the argument has been very much the other way. Whereas the noble Earl argued--and I believe that it was the Government's view--that the existing regime was an impediment to recruitment, it has been put fairly before your Lordships today that the removal of the qualifications hitherto required may discourage talented people from thinking of the probation service as a career.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para73"></a>If that is so, the opportunity is now open to the Minister. The statutory instrument was made yesterday and there is no going back. We are not trying to rewrite history. But if the effect of the order has been to open the possibility of a more varied recruitment than was hitherto the case and to bring forward more candidates for service in the probation service I believe that the Minister will have no difficulty in accepting the Motion. As the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, clearly explained, it deals with training and qualifications after recruitment and not with training and qualifications before recruitment. There would be nothing inconsistent and nothing embarrassing in the Government accepting the Motion as it stands and acting upon it and therefore to have the opportunity of the wider recruitment that the Government originally had in mind while at the same <P>


<a name="column_940"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 940</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time not losing the possibility of potential recruits of a high quality. The noble Lord, Lord Carr of Hadley, said that the Motion before the House was entirely compatible with yesterday's statutory instrument.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para74"></a>As was reflected in every speech made today, we all believe that the probation service performs a difficult and unglamorous task with a high degree of competence and a serious commitment to the objectives set for it by the Home Office. I believe that given the new regime created by the statutory instrument the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, if carried, will ensure that so far as possible such an outstanding record is continued.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-04_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Plant of Highfield: </B>   My Lords, I shall not detain the House with a detailed speech because most of the important points have been rehearsed by other noble Lords, including two former Home Secretaries. When the matter was discussed in your Lordships' House in April, I made a long speech which was critical of the Government's approach.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para75"></a>The probation service does an excellent job and I believe that the evidence shows that probation works. I am in favour of recruiting as wide a spectrum of people as possible into the probation service but not at the cost of undermining training, which underpins this effective and professional service. The changes that are currently in train, if not modified by the acceptance of the Motion tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, may well lead to a lack of effectiveness when dealing with offenders.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para76"></a>If we want to change in an effective way the behaviour of offenders, we must look at the total context of their criminal behaviour. In the case of many offenders, that means addressing drugs and alcohol abuse, psychological disorders and failures in family and personal relations. Of course, probation officers must have a prime responsibility to the courts and to the criminal justice system but a range of skills are essential to addressing the overall environment of offenders. They ought to be incorporated in the new training schemes which should be externally validated to ensure common standards across the service and a high degree of professionalism; that the needs of offenders are met; and that probation officers can move between employers. That may not be the case if there are not common standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para77"></a>In my academic career I have often taught probation trainees. Many of those trainees where drawn from the Armed Forces in Hampshire. I have not met a single mature student who believed that the skills learnt in those spheres, valuable though they would be in practice, could be transferred to probation work without extensive academic study linked to practical work during their two-year course.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para78"></a>If the Government believe that training in, for example, social work skills weakens a trainee probation officer's commitment to the criminal justice aspect of probation work, which must be seen as central, and fosters a perhaps less judgmental approach towards offenders, that could be corrected by specific courses <P>


<a name="column_941"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 941</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>within training programmes, as was suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Gisborough. However, in my view, it is essential for the reasons that I have given that social work skills are not lost to the probation service.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para79"></a>I commend the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, both to the Minister and to the House. We do no service to the criminal justice system or to changing the behaviour of offenders by reducing the professional competence of probation officers. I fear that that will be the consequence of the Government's proposals and the Motion of the noble Lord would go some way towards mitigating what I strongly believe will be the very negative effects of the Government's changes.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_time14"></A><H5>6.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-04_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the Government have the responsibility to set the policy aims and priorities for the probation service and to ensure that a skilled and effective workforce is ready to meet the considerable demands ahead of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para80"></a>The Probation (Amendment) Rules 1995, which came into effect yesterday, remove the absolute requirement, irrespective of any education and/or experience that a person may have, for probation officers to have a social work qualification--a requirement which does not apply, in law, to chief or deputy chief probation officers nor even to social workers employed by local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para81"></a>It is quite wrong to say that the Government are removing a qualification and putting nothing in its place. Education and training for probation officers will be rigorous and effective. Assessment procedures will be put in place to select people for aptitude and potential to work in the probation service. Prior experience will be given a value, and training will be tailored quite specifically to cover the skills and underpinning knowledge necessary to practise effectively as a probation officer. Entry to the service will be on the basis of achieving the necessary standard. Nor are the changes an attack on the professional status of probation officers. They are a recognition of the service's special character and role. Probation work is not a branch of social work, but a discipline in its own right.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para82"></a>There is no doubt that probation officers require some of the same knowledge and skills as general social workers, not least because of a point made by my noble friend Lady Faithfull who said that the two services often have to work together closely. But other disciplines are equally relevant; for example, understanding the criminal justice system and psychology. Probation officers have correctional and enforcement responsibilities as well as a role in helping offenders, through rehabilitation programmes, to change their lifestyles. Their selection and training should reflect those responsibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para83"></a>It is for this reason that we concluded that it no longer made sense to insist that probation officers should have a social work qualification as a single route to practise in the probation service. It is important to be clear: the rule change does not mean that qualified social workers are in any way disqualified from becoming probation <P>


<a name="column_942"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 942</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>officers. What it does mean is that the probation service is no longer tied to the social work education system and can look to recruit able people from a wide range of backgrounds and with a broad range of knowledge and skills, who, with appropriate training and only when meeting the required standards, can enter the probation service.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para84"></a>The changes will, therefore, remove barriers to the recruitment as probation officers of people who have relevant skills and experience to offer, but who lack the social work qualification which is currently required by law. And the training, which prospective probation officers will undertake to equip them with the competence to practise, will be made more flexible to take account of candidates' previous experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para85"></a>I agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Merlyn-Rees. We do not want technocrats knocking at doors and operating like automatons. Probation officers must understand psychology, relationships and the challenge of turning somebody away from a life of crime and dealing with their problems in order to ensure that they again behave in a lawful way in the mainstream community.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para86"></a>The Government accept that it is important that probation officers and those with whom they work have confidence in the standards of training and assessment provided. As the noble Lord, Lord Henniker, said, mistakes by probation officers can have very serious consequences. The competences specified for probation officers require them to have relevant knowledge and theory as well as practical skills and to integrate those effectively in the course of their work.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-04_para87"></a>I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, has not spoken in this debate, but in a meeting with me she made the very important point about not treating practical training and theoretical underpinning knowledge and understanding of the service separately. They should be integrated both in the training and application. That is a point which I have taken very much to heart and will hope to see in any new training arrangements.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness referred to the very interesting meeting which I had with her, perhaps I may underline the fact that the whole point of my theme was that, although probation officers do not need social work training, the training that they receive should be in an institution of higher education.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I do not disagree that the underpinning knowledge and education should take place in a higher education institution. But the point which I believe that the noble Baroness made very effectively to me was that there must be a proper practical link between what goes on in a higher education institution and the application of that knowledge to practical work within the service. I agree absolutely with that and would see that as a feature of any new arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para0"></a>I turn now to the Motion before the House. The key words, to my mind, are "professional qualification", "high standard" and "external validation". The Government fully accept that the involvement of higher <P>


<a name="column_943"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 943</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>education is an essential aspect of the new arrangements. Some of the knowledge needed by competent probation officers--in particular, aspects of law, criminology and psychology--is best provided by the higher education sector. We expect the input to be geared to the individual's training needs and to be presented in modular form. For applicants with little previous experience of the criminal justice system, the higher education component may need to be a significant part of their preparation. But for others, it may be less so. In exceptional cases, an applicant may already have all the theoretical knowledge needed and need practical training and apprenticeship rather than additional university tuition.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para1"></a>I am reminded of a person who applied to the service with two degrees which were both relevant to the work of the probation service. He had practised for seven years as a probation officer in Canada but was not qualified to enter the service without going away to do a two-year diploma in social work, without any guarantee of being taken into the service at the end of that. That will now cease to be the case.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to intervene but I think that that was a one-off case. Ultimately, that person was taken on.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the law was broken in order to take on that person. The law was circumvented and I believe that that was quite right.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para2"></a>Perhaps I may give another practical example which was given in the presence of myself and the noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, very recently. I attended the SOVA annual general meeting. During the course of the evening, I had a very interesting discussion. There were other people around so that it was a public discussion. I was told of a young man who had been working for some years with SOVA. He had been working with offenders in the community and was one of their most valuable workers. He had been working and interacting with the probation service. At this moment, that young man is a member of the Armed Forces. His duties are such that he is able to work voluntarily for two days per week. He wishes to join the probation service. He will leave the Armed Forces in two years' time. It would be madness to send him away for a single diploma in social work in order that he may enter the probation service. Some value must be placed on the work that he has already undertaken on two days per week in the voluntary sector where he has worked with the probation service and with SOVA, which is an extremely good voluntary organisation. That is the kind of flexibility that we need.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para3"></a>Equally, a colleague from the same discipline may have no voluntary experience at all. The training package for each of those individuals would be different.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para4"></a>As I said, we expect the individual's input to be geared to his training and to be presented in modular form. It is very important that the arrangements should be flexible. Therefore, we shall be looking to universities to develop imaginative approaches to the provision of training by making appropriate use of <P>


<a name="column_944"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 944</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>distance learning and, where appropriate, supported by tutorials, something which higher education institutions are doing very well nowadays.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para5"></a>At the same time, we have every reason to insist that teaching standards are high. We also expect the higher education inputs to be provided in a way which recognises the probation service as an integral part of the criminal justice system.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para6"></a>The Government do not intend to return to the inflexibility of one single and rigid qualification required for appointment as a probation officer. I am glad to note that the Motion standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, does not call for that; it calls for external validation, and we agree with that. The Government want to see the creation of an appropriate NVQ for probation officers which recognises the standard of their competence and expertise, including their underpinning knowledge and understanding of the service. We would expect such an NVQ for probation officers to be at level 4 at least--a higher level qualification--reflecting the professional responsibilities of the work and giving headroom within the NVQ structure for advanced expertise to be recognised at level 5, which is the most advanced award.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para7"></a>Locating probation officer competences in that way in the vocational qualification structure opens up the rewarding possibility of a new continuum of an education and training qualification for all the staff of the probation service, centring around the probation officers' awards. The NVQ system does, of course, involve an important element of external assessment and validation--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for interrupting the Minister again, but, as she has talked about NVQs at levels 4 and 5, she will be as aware as any of us of the mounting volume of criticism which exists about the NVQ method in relation to the underlying knowledge and understanding. I also believe that the noble Baroness is aware that there is a great controversy raging as to how that will be assessed under the NVQ system. If that is what is going to be used for the probation service, we urgently need an answer as to how the underlying knowledge and understanding would in fact be tested.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-05_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness makes a most important point; indeed, both she and I have talked on the subject many times. I have to tell the House that I approach the matter from a different angle. Unless it recognises all of the standards--and they include both knowledge and understanding of the service as well as the practical competencies to practise as a probation officer--then level 4 will not be good enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para8"></a>If we can come together with the service--and we would prefer that the service works with us in that respect--it will be the service, together with the Home Office, which agrees the standard. If that standard happens to be higher, or different, in a positive way, from level 4, then level 4 will not be accepted as a standard. Rather than say, "We must come up to level 4 standard NVQ", much will depend upon the quality of <P>


<a name="column_945"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 945</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the lead body and the work that is done in that respect. However, I totally take the point made by the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para9"></a>At the same time, we have no objection to the development of a range of academic qualifications which more experienced probation officers can aim for and which will recognise their developing expertise. Indeed, we encourage the continuing professional development of all staff in the probation service. The Government's decision document, published on 2nd October, makes it clear in terms that, once appointed as qualified, probation officers should have access to a range of vocational and academic qualifications which are relevant to their work and which build on their original education and training.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para10"></a>Indeed, for specialist work within the service--for example, sex therapy programmes, through-care work and the family court welfare work--further in-service training will be required. In respect of further vocational and/or academic qualifications, any contribution which universities make to the training of probation officers prior to appointment should, under the new system which we envisage, be capable of providing learning credits which could be put to a range of possible awards, including professional qualifications. In tendering to provide that contribution, universities should include proposals as to how they would make it work.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para11"></a>I hope that noble Lords will see that there is much common ground here; and that we want standards of training to be raised rather than reduced. It may assist your Lordships if I recapitulate the sequence of events as we see it which should apply to the whole process. Trainees will undertake training within probation services with an individually-tailored package of theory and practice managed by the service. Appropriate teaching and tutorial support will be provided by higher education and requisitioned by the probation service. Depending on the trainee's previous experience and aptitude, training could last a few months or up to two years. Competence to practise will be formally assessed against national criteria, including practical demonstrations and written work.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para12"></a>Successful trainees will be awarded qualified probation officer status by the probation service only if they achieve the required standard. All assessment and award procedures will be subject to quality control by HM Inspectorate of Probation and quality controlled. Moreover, and to take on the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, training should provide a platform for the recognition of competence through NVQs and the development of competence through further training as appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para13"></a>The Home Office wishes to work with the probation service and with higher education to make the new arrangements a success. Indeed, many of the detailed points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Merlyn-Rees--and, indeed, by other speakers in the debate--cannot be determined without the active participation of the service. However, I am aware that concerns and anxieties remain. Development of the new arrangements is under way. Therefore, we need to make progress with those arrangements, without which a vacuum will develop.

<A NAME = "51205-05_para14"></a>Much has been said about responses to the concentration and about the so-called wholesale opposition to the proposals. I have to say that that is too simplistic a view. Many respondents saw the need for some change; indeed, that view is also held by many within the service and by some with whom I have had meetings over recent months. I admit that there is a lively debate about the nature of such a change and about the details of the new arrangements. I would use this occasion to invite the probation service to engage with us in the work.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para15"></a>The subject of consistency of standards has been raised. It is another important point that I should like to address. The Government will ensure that standards will be consistently applied between probation services and the consortia in which they will operate the new arrangements; through the way in which higher education makes provision and in response to the specific specifications determined centrally; and, of course, through the involvement of HM Inspectorate of Probation. We expect the consortia to work together and for there to be a consistency of approach. The involvement of higher education in the new arrangements should not be played down. That involvement will itself bring with it a concern for standards and consistency.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para16"></a>Just as the NCVQ oversees and accredits higher standards for management, as the noble Lord, Lord Merlyn-Rees, affirmed, so those structures should embrace a whole range of occupations--an increasing spectrum, including professional working--into which probation officers' working standards will slot and be validated. Standards will be consistent. Recruits to the service will be salaried trainees. They will be subject to assessment procedures before acceptance as trainees to test their aptitude for probation work, their capability to undertake the education and training that is necessary; to give a value to any relevant education experience that they may bring; and to determine a programme of education and training that they will require in order to reach the standard necessary to enter the service as qualified probation officers. That standard will be consistently applied.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para17"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, said that she could not accept the assertion so authoritatively put forward that underpinning knowledge will be removed. I hope that I have made it abundantly clear to the House that the underpinning knowledge is an essential, central part of becoming a probation officer. My noble friend Lady Faithfull was concerned about moving in a different direction from social work education. Social work may or may not be moving towards a three-year degree course, but probation work is a profession in its own right. In the new arrangements we are moving to a probation-specific training which meets the needs of individual trainees and of the service. Noble Lords have consistently under-estimated the nature and content of the proposed training, the involvement of higher education and the standards which have already been published as competencies for probation officers and, of course, national standards, which are also a matter for public publication.

<A NAME = "51205-05_para18"></a>I have discussed our changes in some detail. I hope that what I have said will have reassured some of your Lordships that the Government are determined to ensure that probation officers are properly trained. We know that much work is in hand to develop the assessment and training systems. I understand that noble Lords may feel that there is not enough flesh on the bones at present. Therefore, I suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, may consider withdrawing the Motion on the basis that the work is in hand to develop high standards of training, including higher education elements, to lead to a properly assessed and properly controlled standard of entry to the service which, in due course, will be externally validated under the NVQ system with the caveats that I have mentioned during the course of today's debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para19"></a>Our intention is that the new arrangements should, at a minimum, maintain the already high standards of the service. My own belief is that the new arrangements will lead to able, competent and professional probation officers. I emphasise that the Government recognise the difficult, demanding and sometimes dangerous work that probation officers are called upon to do. They are, and will continue to be, valued professionals.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para20"></a>I welcome the debate, and I am heartened by your Lordships' concern for high standards of training for probation officers. For my part, as the lead Minister with responsibility in this area, the next step is to put these principles into practice. That is where my energies will be devoted.

<A NAME="51205-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Allen of Abbeydale: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. It was a most unusual experience for me to find that, with one exception, there was unanimous backing for my proposal. For her part, the Minister will have felt a little lonely as speech after speech followed in support of the Motion. However, my experience over many years suggests that that is not such an unusual position for a Home Office Minister to be in.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para21"></a>I am grateful for all the trouble that the Minister took in preparing her reply to the debate. Although I cannot claim to have taken it all in, because she spoke at a fair pace, I shall read it all with great interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para22"></a>I am a little disappointed that the noble Baroness spent perhaps rather too much time in defending what is not under attack, namely the decision which has been made and which is embodied in the probation rules which came into force yesterday. I thought that I had made that clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-05_para23"></a>I am also a little bothered by what the noble Baroness said about higher education. I do not think that I am wrong in saying that she suggested at one stage that a higher education component would be an essential part of probation officer training, but that is not what is said in the decision paper from which I quoted, if anyone can now remember what I said in my opening speech an hour or two ago.

<A NAME = "51205-05_para24"></a>I am afraid that I am not persuaded by what the Minister said about the NVQ. Ultimately, I am bothered that she has not conceded that there should be a professional qualification based on higher education and externally validated which would serve to unite the profession. In spite of the request that the noble Baroness made at the end of her speech, I must seek the opinion of the House.

<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_time0"></A><H5>7.1 p.m. </H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-06_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Kimberley </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government when they propose to ban permanently drift netting for salmon, bearing in mind that the United Kingdom and Ireland are the only countries in Europe currently permitting drift netting; and what is the expected effect of the different increases in the cost of rod licences and net licences.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the subject has become a hardy perennial. I believe that this is its 10th year of flowering. Hopefully, this year the Minister's answer may be better than usual, as the honourable Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury has been appointed PPS to the ministry and is extremely knowledgeable about salmon, as also is his wife, who casts a beautiful fly and catches fish! It is also interesting to know that, likewise, my noble friend who <P>


<a name="column_950"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 950</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will answer is also a fisherman. He and I are very nearly equal this year, as I believe that he has caught one and I have caught two; so perhaps I have a slight edge there.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para1"></a>The National Rivers Authority has moved to phase out north-east drift net fishing by introducing a 10-year net limitation order which came into effect in 1992. No doubt my noble friend will say that there has been a 30 per cent. reduction in the number of nets from 140 in 1991 to 99 in 1995.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para2"></a>Unfortunately, that net reduction has not been followed by a reduction in the catch, which continues to increase each year. Herewith are the figures: in 1992, 19,144; in 1993, 41,790; in 1994, 46,554; and in 1995, 49,801. The figure is provisional for 1995 but it is a combined net catch of salmon and grilse from Northumbria and Yorkshire as audited by the National Rivers Authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para3"></a>While those figures probably reflect increases in the overall salmon stock returning to east coast rivers, there is concern among salmon and conservation interests that the intention of the net limitation order is not being achieved. The netsmen dropping out of the fishery are the elderly and the incompetent. I do not believe that real reductions in catch will be achieved until the phase-out of the fishery can be accelerated or quotas imposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para4"></a>There is also considerable anger in Scotland since 80 per cent. of the fish caught by the north-east drift nets are of Scottish origin, reared and paid for by Scottish district salmon fishery boards and bound for Scottish east coast rivers.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para5"></a>I applaud the recent MAFF initiative in setting up a working party with MAFF officials, Orri Vigfusson, the Atlantic Salmon Trust and the Salmon and Trout Association which is investigating ways in which the phase-out of the fishery can be speeded up,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"without causing undue hardship to netsmen". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
However, that working party is making painfully slow progress and will continue to do so unless there is a real will on behalf of the Government to take action on the drift netting issue. Can my noble friend give noble Lords any such assurance on the matter?
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para6"></a>Salmon conservation interests are also waiting for the National Rivers Authority to implement MAFF's recommendation that the start of the drift netting season should be postponed to 1st May in order to conserve spring fish. In fact, the 1991 review of salmon net fisheries made a similar recommendation which was never implemented. United Kingdom interests are contributing &#163;180,000 per annum as their share of the high seas buy-out negotiated by Orri Vigfusson, and already more spring fish are returning to our rivers. However, it would be scandalous if any fish saved by that far-sighted approach were to be caught by the north-east drift nets.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para7"></a>Still on the subject of salmon conservation, can my noble friend give noble Lords the tonnage of fish which a seal eats annually? Also the majority of conservationists do not wish to make the cormorant extinct but would like the RSPB perhaps to be a little more adamant that cormorants need not be protected so completely and utterly.
<P>


<a name="column_951"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 951</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para8"></a>I now turn to rod and net licences. Her Majesty's Government will probably say that charges are yet to be confirmed by the Minister, who at 25th November was still considering objections. Licence increases are designed to help supplement reductions in grant-in-aid. If imposed, the rod licence increase of &#163;10 will bring in about &#163;270,000. The net licence increase will bring in about &#163;65,000. The rod licence increase is 22 per cent.; net licences will increase on average by about 75 per cent. The Salmon and Trout Association is up in arms about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para9"></a>First, the new charges followed a widespread consultation on net licence charges undertaken earlier this year. The Salmon and Trout Association welcomed that review because it said that any charges should be "fair and consistent" with rods. However, in order to achieve consistency, net licence charges would have had to rise between 400 per cent. and 600 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para10"></a>Secondly, linking an increase of &#163;10 to the rod licence came as a complete surprise to the Salmon and Trout Association and made it very angry. Far from achieving the consistency hoped for, it increases the gap. The rod increase alone will bring in &#163;270,000, which is more than the entire income from net licences of &#163;165,000. As the nets catch 70 per cent. of our salmon stock--that includes the Scottish component of the north-east drift nets which the NRA has conveniently omitted from its calculations--and pay less than 20 per cent. of National Rivers Authority fisheries income, it must be obvious to all that it is grossly unfair.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para11"></a>Thirdly, the NRA also announced the intention to move to a &#163;75 rod licence and to achieve parity of net licence income "in an appropriate timescale". The Salmon and Trout Association has said that it would accept the proposals if a firm five-year timescale were introduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para12"></a>Fourthly, MAFF has privately admitted that there is no way in which net licences can be increased to achieve parity without driving netsmen out of business, which it says is illegal. Effectively, that means that MAFF is prepared to subsidise the activities of commercial netsmen. The Salmon and Trout Association believes that that is illegal and may take MAFF to judicial review. But before taking further action the Salmon and Trout Association will await the Minister's decision as to whether he confirms the National Rivers Authority's proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para13"></a>Lastly, I have three more questions. Will my noble friend give any assurances about the Government's intention to achieve parity between rod and net licence income? Secondly, can he comment on the seeming determination of his officials effectively to subsidise the operation of commercial netting interests to the detriment of the rod fishery and all the perceived benefits angling brings to the rural economy?
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para14"></a>My third question is this. Does my noble friend believe that a further punitive increase in rod and net licence charges, which between them will realise only &#163;330,000, can in any way substitute for Her Majesty's Government's &#163;8 million cuts in grant-in-aid from 1993 <P>


<a name="column_952"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 952</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to 1997 which will paralyse the essential fisheries work of the NRA and, as from 1st April, the Environment Agency?
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_time1"></A><H5>7.11 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mason of Barnsley: </B>   My Lords, I am only too pleased to support the noble Earl on this issue, as I have done on previous occasions. He and I have probably participated in every one of these debates on the abolition of North Sea drift netting.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para15"></a>I believe that it is really time this indiscriminate netting of salmon in the North Sea was stopped. I just cannot understand why the Government and the National Rivers Authority do not recognise that indiscriminate, interceptory drift netting is bad management practice and should be deplored by the National Rivers Authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para16"></a>The long nylon monofilament gill nets are taking salmon in the North Sea as they make their way to their home rivers--indiscriminately. That means south of the River Esk (Yorkshire's salmon river) the drift netters could well be taking most of the spawning salmon heading for the Esk--quite indiscriminately--denuding it of its stock. That is obvious bad management practice. The National Rivers Authority has a statutory duty to, "maintain, improve and develop" fisheries. Through the allowing of this drift netting, the Yorkshire Esk is being denied the right to improve and develop its fishery, and therefore the National Rivers Authority and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are in breach of their statutory duties. That is my first charge.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para17"></a>Secondly, the nylon monofilament gill nets should be banned. These nets are almost invisible and quite deadly in operation, trapping the salmon by their gills. Because of their strength they take seals and porpoises, too. If a net breaks, it hangs in the sea. It becomes a ghost net, continuing to kill fish and diving birds--especially gannets--for years thereafter, unlike the old hemp nets which gradually rot. Surely the Government cannot condone such a practice. So, my Lords, I ask: why not ban these gill nets?
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para18"></a>Thirdly, why do the Government continue to be internationally embarrassed in the councils of NASCO--the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation? NASCO, the North Atlantic Salmon Trust and the Salmon and Trout Association--all international and national salmon conservation bodies--have campaigned for years to conserve salmon stocks and persuade governments to cut back on salmon netting--with some success overseas, but not with the British Government. When called upon to ban drift netting within the councils of the international NASCO--embarrassingly so--what is the Government's reply? Perhaps it is, "We are phasing out, under recent net limitation orders"; or, "Set up a working party". I believe that to be government procrastination, there is no need to delay. How long, I ask, will it take to end this indiscriminate, bad management practice? Ten, 20 years? I know that the concern is of course the jobs of the netters. These are part-time fishermen; they can work only when the salmon are running--a few months. They could be quickly phased out with compensation. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Our trawler fleet has already been subject to some decommissioning, and indeed, one or two of our major labour-intensive industries have been run down. Phasing out part-time salmon netters pales into insignificance compared with these rundowns.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para19"></a>The Government, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the National Rivers Authority should turn their minds to this problem. Let us rid ourselves of these hated gill nets; let us have better conservation of the salmon and increased protection of the seals, porpoises and diving birds in the North Sea. It would remove the hindrance to the spawning salmon. Salmon rivers would be better stocked, and above all, the international embarrassment removed in future NASCO meetings.

<A NAME="51205-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Moran </B>   My Lords, I too wish strongly to support what was said by the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, and the noble Lord, Lord Mason of Barnsley. It makes me rather sad that we have been deliberating over this question for so long, as the noble Earl pointed out. On looking back at previous copies of Hansard, I find that just under 10 years ago I proposed an amendment at the Committee stage of the Salmon Bill on 30th January 1986 which suggested a five-year phasing out of the north-east drift-net fishery. With my noble friend Lord Perth, I proposed another amendment at Report stage. If that had been accepted, the fishery would have been closed about five years ago. That would have been a good thing, but unfortunately the Government decided on the long phasing out by the retiring of fishermen. As the noble Earl said, although it has resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of licences from 130 to 99, it has not resulted in any decrease in the number of salmon caught by that fishery--rather the reverse, because the salmon come up a narrow corridor and it only takes a small number of efficient fishermen to catch a great many of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para20"></a>What has worried me all along is the effect on our international position which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Mason. When we were discussing the Salmon Bill, I said on 14th January 1986:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Our position, as I see it, is hopelessly compromised so long as we allow drift netting off north-east England to continue...If our voice is to carry weight internationally, we have to put our own house in order.".--[Official Report, 14/1/86; col. 1025.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is still true. The fishermen in Greenland now say:"Well, you're doing it, we don't see why we should be bought out". The Irish, whose drift-netting I shall talk about in a moment, likewise see no reason why they should take firm action when we are doing so little. I think, therefore, that it is important that the Government should address the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para21"></a>There is one aspect which worries me very much. I remember going with some of my colleagues to see the then Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Waldegrave, to discuss the problem, after which he helpfully set up the working party to which the noble Earl referred. In referring to the report on run timing of salmon by the Salmon Advisory Committee, he said in a news release on 28th June this year:
<P>


<a name="column_954"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 954</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My Rt Hon friends and I are drawing these recommendations for management action to the attention of the National Rivers Authority and the District Salmon Fisheries Boards in Scotland and, asking them, in particular, to consider urgently"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I emphasise the word "urgently"--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"whether, and if so what, action is needed to conserve the runs of spring fish in the fisheries for which they are responsible ... In this context I am asking the National Rivers Authority to reconsider the recommendation, in the Report on Salmon Net Fisheries presented to Parliament in 1991, that the opening date for the drift net fisheries of Northumbria and Yorkshire should be postponed until 1 May so as to reduce the level of exploitation of spring running salmon. The NRA decided not to implement this recommendation, on the grounds that any action on spring fish needed to be part of a wider programme embracing rod and net fisheries in both England and Scotland. In the light of the Salmon Advisory Committee's report, and in the expectation that appropriate action will be taken in other fisheries, there is now an opportunity for a postponement of the opening of the drift netting season until 1 May to form part of such a wider programme". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is a very clear steer to the NRA by the Minister then responsible. That was at the end of June. However, so far as I know, nothing has happened. Will the Minister say why that is and what is happening? Does he expect the NRA to pay attention to the statement by Mr. Waldegrave and to change the opening date? That would save many of the multi-sea winter fish returning to this country, which we all want very much to see.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para22"></a>I now turn to the question of the Irish drift-net fisheries. I gave the Minister notice that I should raise this particular point. I should explain that I have an interest in Wales because my family has a salmon beat on the Wye. The Welsh Region of the NRA has done research for 10 years on the tagging of smolts and on what happens to them when they go down to sea. The scientists in the Welsh region are extremely good. They are particularly knowledgeable about salmon and sea trout. In June, they wrote to the then Secretary of State for Wales stating the three key findings of their 10-year research. The first was that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The drift-net fishery off Ireland's west coast takes many more grilse (one sea winter fish) and more salmon (multi-sea winter fish) than Greenland, Faroes and the other distant water fisheries all put together". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Secondly,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The number of fish taken in the Irish drift-net fishery probably exceeds both the licensed rod and the licensed net catches in Welsh rivers and is over two thirds of the total Welsh Region salmon catch". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Thirdly,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Differing survival rates for hatchery-reared salmon smolts and wild smolts means that the true catch for the Irish drift-net fishery may be considerably larger than the figure indicated by this 10 year study". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para23"></a>The letter explained:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The NRA is pursuing a policy of phasing out, via reducing net limitation orders ... net fisheries which exploit predominantly mixed stocks"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
that of course applies in Wales and even more to the north-east drift-net fisheries, though it is not concerned with those--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"since such indiscriminate exploitation makes the management of individual salmon river fisheries impossible. The NRA's draft strategy for the management of salmon in England and Wales commits us to phasing out mixed stock fisheries". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is very welcome.
<P>


<a name="column_955"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 955</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para24"></a>Clearly this is a matter within the competence of the Government of the Republic of Ireland. I hope very much that the Government, both bilaterally with the Irish authorities and in the European Union, will do their utmost to persuade the Irish either to cut out or reduce very substantially the drift-netting which is damaging stocks in Wales, western Scotland and elsewhere. It is extremely important that this should be done. I know that many people in Ireland who are very knowledgeable about salmon conservation are working hard to that end. I hope that the Government will use all their influence to achieve some progress. I shall be very grateful if the Minister can tell me what is being done on that score.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para25"></a>Lastly, I turn briefly to the question of licence fees, which was raised by the noble Earl. A problem arises from the reduction in the grant-in-aid given by the Government to the NRA, said to be from &#163;13.4 million in 1991-92 to &#163;8 million in the current year. The reduction has been very damaging. It is very important that we should do all we can to conserve stocks of salmon, which are subject to so many threats all over the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para26"></a>We must bear in mind that a great part of the costs incurred by the NRA are incurred as a result of the need for enforcement. Parliament has laid down the law, stating that it is a crime to pursue salmon or sea trout illegally. Very often there are violent gangs engaged in this practice. Action against them by the police and by bailiffs is enforcing the law as passed by Parliament. It is not reasonable that the whole cost should fall on the beneficiaries. The grant-in-aid should certainly be restored to a level of at least &#163;10 million, and preferably more. Certainly it would be absolutely wrong for it to be cut further.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para27"></a>The NRA is faced with the current problem of trying to raise enough to deal with its work on migratory fish. The expenditure on coarse and trout fishing is ring-fenced; that pays for itself. The licences cover the cost; but they do not go anywhere near covering the cost on salmon and sea trout, the management of which is a much more expensive business. The NRA conducted a review in which it stated that it wanted the cost of the licence to be consistent and fair as between the nets and the rods. The problem is that it is in no way consistent and fair at the moment since, as the noble Earl said, the nets take 70 per cent. of the catch. Even if the Scottish element in that is excluded, it is still a great deal more than half. The netsmen, however, pay only 20 per cent. of the cost. They have been, and still are, subsidised. That appears to many anglers as a deliberate policy of keeping commercial netsmen in business at the rod anglers' expense. It is also damaging the future of salmon. That policy must be examined.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-06_para28"></a>In the past we allowed the licence rates for commercial netsmen to fall so low that they are now a ridiculous sum. They contribute only something between &#163;160,000 this year and &#163;300,000 next year. That is a trifling sum, whereas the anglers are being asked to produce &#163;1.3 million. It is very important to get the level right. I realise that it cannot be done in one <P>

<P>
<A NAME="51205-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Burton: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask just one question. As my noble friend Lord Kimberley said, a very large number of salmon caught in the north-east coast drift-nets are heading for Scottish rivers. In view of that, could my noble friend ask his Ministry to consult with the Department of Agriculture in Scotland and with the Association of Scottish District Salmon Fishing Boards, which are responsible not only for the rod fishing but also for the net fishing in Scotland, and take heed of what they tell them?
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_time0"></A><H5>7.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, for asking this important Question. As he said when he opened the debate, we have been here before. Indeed, debates on drift-netting seem to come round with the regularity of the annual Budget Statement. But perhaps the subject this evening is a little more interesting than last Tuesday's offering.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para0"></a>Clearly, anybody interested in the orderly management of our fish stocks wishes to ensure that the fishing methods are properly controlled and soundly based in terms of conservation. Your Lordships' Select Committee on the European Communities reported in July 1994 (the 13th Report of that Session) on the regulation of drift-net fishing. The committee was quite scathing about the proposals of the European Commission on that subject at that time. Perhaps I may quote from the opinion of that committee in paragraph 40 of the report:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There may or may not be a case for banning the use of drift nets over 2.5 km in length, or for banning their use altogether. There may also be a case for continuing a temporary derogation in their use in certain fisheries. But the [European] Commission's report offers little justification for any of these actions and it gives no explanation for the inconsistencies in the courses of action proposed. The Committee is also disturbed by the lack of objectivity apparent in the Commission's report and indeed by accusations of a lack of intellectual integrity in the document". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para1"></a>Obviously, the Select Committee was not particularly enamoured of the Commission's proposals on the matter. Obviously, it is very complicated. Everyone seems to agree that drift nets over 2.5 km in length should be banned. That is in line with the recommendations of the United Nations and the European Union. I understand that the Government's policy is fully in line with that and they are supported by us in the Labour Party.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para2"></a>With regard to the effect of the different sizes of net, there has been some interesting correspondence on this matter, and a briefing was received only today, from Greenpeace and the Wildlife and Countryside Link. It has probably been received also by other noble Lords. I found the briefing rather confusing. It seemed to argue that the present derogation allowing the use of drift nets up to 2.5 km should be banned because of the damage that is being done by the larger drift nets. I found that argument rather hard to follow. The reply from Mr. Tony Baldry, Minister of State, which was included <P>


<a name="column_957"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 957</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the briefing neatly skirted around the problem. In his letter to the Wildlife and Countryside Link, Cetaceans Group, Mr. Baldry said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is our experience that the permitted use of drift nets up to 2.5 km long does not lead to fraud as your letter suggests. This year, UK tuna skippers agreed that the Sea Fisheries Inspectorate should measure their nets before they were loaded. As part of this exercise net plans were prepared and made available to the RN Fisheries Protection Squadron to help with enforcement at sea. No nets longer than 2.5 km were loaded; and no nets longer than 2.5 km were found in use at sea by UK vessels". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That rather neatly skirted around the problem. If what the Minister said is correct, that is all very fine and well. But what does that have to do with the allegations concerning the use of larger drift nets by the Italian and other fleets. We should be interested to know the Government's view of those allegations that other member states are consistently flouting the current regulations or agreements.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para3"></a>It seems to us that the proposed phasing out of the north-east drift net industry is sensible. Can the Government say what is their latest estimate of how long that phasing out will take? To pick up the important point made by my noble friend Lord Mason of Barnsley, can they say what would be the effect on employment of closing down that part of the industry now, including the upstream employment in processing and so on?
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para4"></a>No doubt we can all agree on the right components of a successful policy on this matter. It would obviously include a ban on the long Pacific drift nets and the use of the 2.5 km limit; with perhaps more rapid phasing out than is presently planned. There should be an exploration of the more technical conservation measures so long as the drift nets are used, such as sonar reflectors and windows for existing drift nets. All forms of fishing should be sustainable and not environmentally damaging. That would cover such matters as the use of drift nets in different fisheries, relative size, depth of use and various escape panels.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para5"></a>There still seems to be a crying need for accurate scientific information in order to enable us to make an informed judgment on drift-netting. We should, therefore, continue to be guided by the best scientific advice on this matter. I understand that there is soon to be a scientific advisory report made to the European Commission. It would be interesting if the Minister could comment on whether that is likely to be available.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para6"></a>If drift-netting is clearly shown to be environmentally damaging, we can all support moves to ban it, as indeed we should support all moves to eliminate any fishing practice that is clearly shown to be environmentally damaging. At the moment the jury is out on the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para7"></a>There is important work being done by the British fishing industry on technical conservation measures. The Government should give all possible support to research and development in this area. All technical conservation measures should be included in all the European directives relating to all drift nets of whatever size.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para8"></a>I thank the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, for tabling this Question and look forward to hearing the Minister's reply and whether the Government have anything new to say on this matter.

<P>
<A NAME="51205-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Kimberley and other noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. Like my noble friend Lady Blatch, I find myself somewhat under siege. I am glad to have had some support from the noble Lord, Lord Carter, but I cannot say how much I miss the speech from the noble Viscount, Lord Thurso. In previous years he has been a notable supporter of the Government's position. We hope to hear from his successor soon.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para9"></a>It has been said that I am a salmon fisherman, and indeed that is true. Would that it were a declarable interest. But I am afraid that, were we at a stroke to double the number of salmon caught in British rivers, it would merely result in the costs of salmon fishing doubling and my having to move to less expensive rivers again.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para10"></a>Although there have been some interesting developments over the past year since a similar Question was asked, the Government's stance has not changed. The Government's policy on the north-east coast salmon drift-net fishery is based on a review of salmon net fisheries presented to Parliament in October 1991. The review showed that the drift-net fishery posed no immediate threat to stocks and there was thus no immediate justification for depriving licence holders of their licences. Taken as a whole, the UK salmon stocks are in good health. The north-east drift-net fishery accounts for about 15 per cent. of the catch. It is not a significant burden on the stocks as they are now. If action were necessary, it would be necessary to take it across the whole industry, and a substantially greater proportion are caught by fixed nets than are ever caught by the north-east fishery.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para11"></a>However, it is agreed between us that the north-east drift-net fishery exploits several salmon and sea trout stocks and that this makes the task of conservation and management more difficult. It is widely accepted--and by us--that salmon stocks are best managed on a river by river basis. So the fishery is being phased out. Licences are issued, with very limited exceptions, only to those who held licences the previous year. Any licences not taken up are not reissued. That has led to a 30 per cent. reduction in the number of drift-net licences issued since 1992, a rate of decline significantly faster than was predicted by the NRA when this policy was introduced. I can give noble Lords some comfort. It is not just the elderly and infirm who were giving up licences; it appears to be across the whole age range and range of competence.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para12"></a>My noble friend Lord Kimberley said that catches had not decreased. Indeed, that is so. But it has been a good period for salmon catches elsewhere in the industry and, should that position change, drift-net catches may go down. However, the fishery will eventually be extinguished. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, asked how long that would take. We have not changed our position that it will happen over a 30-year period. It is happening fast at the moment; we cannot predict whether or not that will continue.
<P>


<a name="column_959"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 959</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para13"></a>The Government keep the position under careful review. As we said at the time, if further action was required in order to conserve stocks, we would not hesitate to take it. I repeat that assurance today. We see no need to go beyond the recommendations of the 1991 report. Indeed, the salmon stocks exploited by the drift-net fishery are probably in better shape than the great majority of fish stocks in the North Sea.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para14"></a>The approach adopted towards the north-east coast fisheries is, where appropriate, being extended to other fisheries such as that for the sea trout off the East Anglian coast. That brings me to the question of the Irish fishery. As the noble Lord, Lord Moran, rightly said, that is a matter for the Irish Government. It is clear that those fisheries do take a substantial number of salmon destined for England and Wales, though we do not at present have any evidence that the current level of exploitation poses a threat to stocks.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para15"></a>The Irish Government have established a task force to consider the practical long-term strategies for salmon management with a view to developing a system for the sustainable management of stocks. We have an input to that process. We are talking to the Irish Government. My right honourable friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food drew the attention of the Irish Government to our policy on mixed stock fisheries and the method we are pursuing to phase them out. We are also working to establish a better estimate of the effects of those fisheries on British stocks.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para16"></a>My right honourable friend agreed with the Prime Minister that a scientific working group comprising officials from MAFF, the NRA and the Department of the Marine will be set up to review the available data, agree on a method of analysis and provide the best estimate of the level of exploitation of British stock in the Irish fishery. The first meeting of that group will take place at the end of January, though MAFF scientists have already had a preliminary meeting with the NRA. If it is any comfort on other subjects raised by noble Lords, while the Irish fishery impact on grilse returning to some rivers may be as high as 20 per cent., the impact on multi-winter salmon and on spring-run salmon appears to be much lower.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para17"></a>The Government fully accept that recreational salmon fisheries are an important feature of the local economy in many parts of the country. It does not follow from that that net fisheries should necessarily be brought to an end. In the first place, the effect on rod catchers of ending net fisheries are often overstated. That has some bearing on the relative level of charges for netsmen and rod licences. The two can co-exist without necessarily competing with each other over the whole range of catches. Rod catches in Great Britain have remained remarkably stable, despite changes in netting effort and catches.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para18"></a>It is also important not to ignore the economic and social effects of an early closure on the fishermen involved in this fishery. Our commercial fishing industry is currently under great pressure and Ministers are most reluctant to add to it. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, asked how many jobs are involved. I do not have an exact estimate. It will probably be a few hundred.
<P>


<a name="column_960"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 960</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para19"></a>The Government are not in any way opposed to private efforts to compensate netsmen for giving up their licences. In Scotland, where netting rights are private, it has become relatively common for riparian owners to buy out netting rights and the reduction in netting effort that has taken place in Scotland is largely due to market forces. The way is now open for market forces to play a role in the north-east coast drift-net fishery. It is for those who wish to see that fishery ended to negotiate with the netsmen. We are ready to discuss the issues involved. Officials have had several meetings with representatives of the North Atlantic Salmon Fund and the Salmon and Trout Association. We remain ready to continue those discussions.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para20"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mason of Barnsley, suggested that NASCO had called on the UK to ban drift-netting. That is simply not the case. In fact, one of NASCO's primary roles is to set quotas for drift-net fisheries operating in Greenland.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para21"></a>My noble friend Lord Kimberley raised the question of the impact of seals on salmon stocks. We are aware of the increasing anxiety in that area. Over the past decade numbers of grey seals in Great Britain have grown at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum and the population has doubled in the past six to eight years to over 143,000. It was estimated that if each seal ate only one adult salmon per year, that would amount to almost 60 per cent. of the number caught by all salmon fisheries in Great Britain and well over three times the catch of the north-east coast drift nets in 1993.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para22"></a>In practice, it is unlikely that predation by seals has a significant effect on stocks. Evidence available from various studies carried out suggests that they are opportunistic feeders whose feeding habits and ranges vary greatly from individual to individual. It is known that some seals may take salmon in estuaries before they enter rivers to spawn and some seals have been known to take salmon from nets. But by far the major part of their diet appears to be made up from marine species such as sand eel, Norway pout, tusk and ling.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para23"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mason of Barnsley, also asked about monofilament nets. He argued that the use of gill nets should be banned. A significant proportion of the white fish catch landed in England and Wales is caught in gill nets. Their use is already regulated by primary and secondary legislation. In those circumstances, further control of the use of gill nets in other fisheries would be difficult to justify and place undue restrictions on the activities of inshore fishermen.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para24"></a>The noble Lord also suggested that drift nets used by the north-east coast drift-net fishery catch seals, other marine mammals and sea birds. There is little evidence that that is a serious problem; nor is there any evidence that lost nets cause a significant problem. Netsmen must attend their nets at all times, and few nets are lost. Those that are are soon knocked to the sea bed in the turbulent waters of the North Sea where they fill with debris and cease fishing. As the noble Lord, Lord Carter, said, while we support action taken on gill nets and drift nets over the 2.5 kilometre limit, smaller nets--including those of 500 metres, which is what are common in the salmon fishery in the north-east coast--seem to us to be quite acceptable.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para25"></a>My noble friend Lord Kimberley and the noble Lord, Lord Moran, asked when the NRA would respond to the Government's request to reconsider the opening date for the north-east coast drift net fishery. The Government asked the NRA at the end of June to look again at the question of postponing it to 1st May as part of a wider review of controls on the exploitation of spring run salmon following the publication of the Salmon Advisory Committee's report on the run timing of salmon. I should emphasise however that that initiative on spring run salmon is not primarily concerned with the north-east coast drift-net fishery. That fishery takes relatively few spring salmon--around 400 a year on average. The NRA has been considering the need for additional controls in all the salmon fisheries in England and Wales. That is a major exercise. Nevertheless, I understand that it is almost complete and that the NRA expects to be able to respond shortly.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para26"></a>Let me turn to the second element of my noble friend's question concerning the NRA's widely advertised proposals to increase the duties for rod and net licences. It will be for my right honourable friend the Minister to decide, in the light of the objections that have been received, whether they should be approved with or without modifications or rejected. Given the Minister's statutory role, I shall not comment now on the substance of the NRA's proposals. But perhaps I can in some way answer the suggestion of my noble friend Lord Kimberley that the Government are allowing the net fishery to be subsidised.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para27"></a>My noble friend said that MAFF takes the view that it would be illegal for the NRA to increase licence duties to a level which did not result in an increase in net licence income. In fact, the point that has been made is that both the Government and the NRA must work within the constraints of existing legislation. That <P>


<a name="column_962"></a>

<B>5 Dec 1995 : Column 962</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legislation provides mechanisms to reduce the numbers of net licences and to control net fishing. That is the way in which the net catch is controlled.

<A NAME = "51205-07_para28"></a>Licence duties, however, cannot be used for those purposes and the Government and the NRA would be vulnerable to legal challenge were they to use licence duties to close down or substantially reduce licence numbers in a net fishery. That does not mean that licence duty increases can never lead to a reduction in licence numbers or income, but in our view a policy of deliberately setting duties at levels which it was evident would lead to a significant reduction in income would not be legally sustainable. Such a policy would also conflict with the NRA's financial memorandum which requires it to maximise its return from licence duties and other sources of income.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para29"></a>My noble friend also said that this meant that the Government were prepared to subsidise the activities of commercial netsmen. I would remind the noble Earl that at present more than 80 per cent. of the cost of the NRA's work on salmon and sea trout is paid for by the taxpayer. In practice, as we see it, it is the taxpayer who is providing a subsidy to both rods and nets.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para30"></a>I am sure that there are some points to which I have not responded properly or in full. I shall look at Hansard tomorrow and write as necessary. My noble friend Lord Burton asked about our attitude to the Scots. All I can tell him is that I have talked to them extensively and they have impressed on me the importance with which they view the eventual abolition of the north east drift net fishery. Looking at things from their perspective, I can quite understand why.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205-07_para31"></a>We will continue to follow the phase-out of the fishery closely and if further action is required in order to conserve stocks we will not hesitate to take it.

<P>
<UL>Whether they have received any information from the Chinese authorities about the specific acts said to have been committed by Wei Jungsheng in his alleged attempt to overthrow the Government of China and whether the European Union diplomatic missions in Beijing will jointly appoint a senior official from amongst their staff to monitor the case, to attend, if possible, any court proceedings, and to report back periodically on the case, for publication in every country of the European Union.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   The arrest of Wei Jungsheng is a matter of deep concern. We and our European Union partners are considering what further action to take, and will continue to monitor the situation closely.

<A NAME="51205w01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   The American position has been set out by President Clinton, who has stated publicly that the United States should contribute about one third of the proposed military implementation force (IFOR). The United Kingdom welcomes this. We have made clear that the participation of US ground troops in IFOR is a prerequisite for our participation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205w01_wqn2"></A><B>  Lord Kennet  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether President Clinton has committed the United States to sending ground troops to former Yugoslavia, and if so when did he do so; under what conditions are they to go; what is the mission to which they are committed; and what are its time limits.<P></UL>

<A NAME="51205w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   President Clinton said on 21 November when announcing the initialling of the Bosnia Peace Agreement in Dayton, Ohio, that the United States would be expected to contribute about one-third of the military implementation force (IFOR). The IFOR will be UN-authorised, NATO-led, and will operate with the strategic consent of the parties. President Clinton has indicated that he will request US Congressional support before main deployment.

<P>
<UL>Whether the Joint Declaration in connection with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), in which they and the French, Russian and United States governments welcomed the cessation of the nuclear arms race and reaffirmed their commitment to Article 6 of the NPT, indicates that they consider themselves bound to "pursue negotiations in good faith .... on a treaty on general and comprehensive disarmament under strict and effective international control", and if this Joint Declaration indicates a new collaborative approach on their part to this neglected element of Article 6.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   The terms of the declaration dated 6 April 1995 by France, the Russian Federation, the United States of America and the United Kingdom are clear: the four countries concerned expressed their joint determination to continue to implement fully all the provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, including those in Article VI.

<P>

<A NAME = "51205w01_para2"></a>In addition, we have provided &#163;6.1 million in 1993/94 and &#163;3.9 million in 1994/95 to the World Health Organisation Global Programme on AIDS, a proportion of which was used on HIV/AIDS prevention activities in southern Africa.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="51205w01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   Article 198a of the Treaty of European Union states that members of the Committee are appointed by "the Council, acting unanimously on proposals from respective Member States". In this country, proposals are made by my right honourable Friend, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on the recommendation of my right honourable Friends the Secretaries of State for Environment, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in consultation with local authority associations.

<P>
<A NAME="51205w01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   The political balance of the UK membership of the Committee of the Regions reflects that of local government in 1993, when the committee was convened. The political balance will be maintained for the four-year term of the committee. Any vacancies which arise during this period will be filled by a representative of the same political group as the former member.

<FONT SIZE=3>Northern Ireland compared with 126 murders in the 14 months prior to the PIRA ceasefire.
<P>

<A NAME = "51205w01_para3"></a>Over the same period, there have been 223 casualties of so-called punishment assaults, 75 of which have been attributed to loyalist groups, 148 to republican groups. This compares with 45 casualties as a result of 'punishment' assaults in the 14 months before the PIRA ceasefire, 37 of which were attributed to loyalist groups, 8 to republican groups. However, in addition there were 82 'punishment' shootings attributed to loyalist groups (and 13 between 1 September 1994 and 13 October 1994) and 63 shootings attributed to republican groups.

<A NAME = "51205w01_para4"></a>Over the same period since the PIRA ceasefire, there have been 137 arson attacks on Orange Order property, church and chapel property, GAA property and schools. This compares with 65 similar types of attack in the 14 months before the PIRA ceasefire.

<A NAME="51205w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security   (Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish): </B>  On the basis of the Income Support Quarterly Enquiry November 1994, the latest available data, it is estimated that there are 5,700,000 recipients of income support, of whom 1,590,000 are of pensionable age, 687,000 receive the Disability Premium and 1,759,000 are registered as unemployed.

Most public CCTV systems have done so. All schemes receiving government funding for CCTV are required to put in place such codes as a condition of grant. The Home Office guidance booklet "CCTV--Looking Out for You" contains advice on how to adopt a code of practice and the issues it should cover.
