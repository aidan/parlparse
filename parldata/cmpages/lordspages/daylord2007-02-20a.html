Under Section 93 of the Police Act 1996, a police authority may accept gifts or loans, including commercial sponsorship, for any activity of the authority or of the police force it maintains. It is for the authority to determine the appropriate terms for the acceptance of such gifts or loans. The control and tasking of officers in sponsored posts remain with the chief officer of the force concerned.</p>

The Minister will be aware of the very fine reputation enjoyed by the Metropolitan Police&#146;s art and antiquities squad; the only specialist art squad in this country, which I believe numbers four officers, compared to 250 in Italy. But is the Minister confident that there is not the risk of a conflict of interest here? I am sure that the police would not invite drug barons to fund a drugs squad, but is there not the serious risk of a situation arising where he who pays the piper calls the tune?</p>

Like all UK police forces, the Metropolitan Police is open to accept offers of sponsorship and support. So far as I am concerned, this arrangement works perfectly well.</p>

That market is easily made a conduit for fraud, money laundering and the funding of organised crime. Without casting any aspersion on the integrity and competence of the present staff, if it is to be a condition of the continuation of the unit that it raises half its costs in sponsorship, will not this be an open invitation to corruption and, in the real sense of the term, a cop-out?</p>

So far as I understand it, there is no threat to the current staffing levels of the unit. I also understand that, because of the valuable work that is undertaken by special constables, there has already been expansion of the unit&#146;s activities. I do not think that one should have any doubt about the competence of those working in the unit; it is very competent. The Metropolitan Police is in a sense seeking funding so that it can expand the unit&#146;s range of activities.</p>

I would be surprised if a Minister was unhappy with four people managing the &#163;100 million area of art theft. Will the Minister say whether the 14 special constables plus four full-time staff will be able to deal with the money laundering activities of those who use art for money laundering, and especially those who are importing artefacts from Iraq that have been looted and are being sold on the British market?</p>

There is a desire to expand the unit, and seeking sponsorship to enable that to happen is very important. The unit gets very useful back-up and support from special constables, many of whom come from the sector that is most affected and have knowledge and experience. There is great confidence in this unit, which does a very valuable job.</p>

Clearly, the commissioner is very well aware of the problem; indeed, I am sure he could not fail to be otherwise. But this is a matter for his judgment on operational grounds, and that is the best way for us to leave it. I have little doubt that the commissioner will pay very close attention to what noble Lords have said today.</p>

The intention is to seek further support so that the activities of the unit can be expanded, no doubt for the very reasons that the noble Baroness and other noble Lords have given voice to this afternoon. It does a very valuable job, and it has a very good track record. It is greatly respected across the industry, and no doubt the continued support that it enjoys here and in other places will be much welcomed.</p>

Nevertheless, does the Minister agree that, for several years now, serious human rights crimes have no longer been considered the internal affair of a given country but concern the international community as a whole? Would not, therefore, a review of the rules on immunity, under the aegis of the Council of Europe, be a good thing?</p>

In her Answer, she suggests that the United Nations is the right place to deal with this matter rather than the Council of Europe. Is it not the case that this country is bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, that it is a member of the Council of Europe and that the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe has identified a pressing problem, which is that the exceptions for human rights to state immunity are not sufficiently clear because they do not go beyond torture and deal, for example, with what is euphemistically called &#147;enforced disappearance&#148;? Would she ask her colleagues to reconsider their position, to support the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe and to ensure that we have a British representative on the ad hoc committee with a view to producing a proper international instrument on that?</p>

I did not press the amendments on the understanding that there would be further discussions with the noble Baroness in order to meet certain concerns that the Lord Chief Justice had expressed. Such discussions have now taken place, with the result that I have added a new paragraph (b) to the proposed subsection (7A). This, I believe, gives the Lord Chief Justice and the senior president of tribunals all the flexibility to which they are entitled, while at the same time preserving the principle that I and others regard as so important. I have confirmed that the Lord Chief Justice is content with the amendment in its present form. That deals with Amendments Nos. 1 and 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07022051000091"></a>For that reason, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and I introduced an amendment on Report requiring that the only judges to sit on the upper tribunal to hear judicial review matters be High Court judges&#151;that is the High Court judges who sit in the Crown Office, now renamed the administrative court, to hear judicial review matters.</p>

However, as is his duty, the Lord Chief Justice has pointed out that the volume of business likely to ensue in the upper tribunal in relation to the number of available High Court judges will, inevitably, mean that, in some circumstances, judges other than High Court judges will be required to sit. That is why the amendment has been modified in this way. The Lord Chief Justice is squarely on the face of the Bill and his responsibility is engaged to ensure that those judges, other than High Court judges, who will sit in the upper tribunal to hear judicial review matters, are of appropriate rank and quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07022051000095"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 retain the noble and learned Lord&#146;s original concept: that judicial review cases transferred to the upper tribunal are to be heard by High Court judges or their equivalent. They also acknowledge that the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord President or the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, together with the Senior President, can agree on others they consider suitable within the terms just described by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07022051000096"></a>On Report, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, tabled amendments which would have permitted only High Court judges or their equivalents to hear applications. The noble and learned Lord did not press the amendments and we agreed to explore further, not least with the Lord Chief Justice, what we might then do. The Lord Chief Justice wrote to me on 7 February and set out his thoughts, copying his letter to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and Lord Justice Carnwath. The Lord Chief Justice was sympathetic to the issues raised, but did not support this amendment, because,</p>
<ul><a name="07022051000323"></a>&#147;some cases in the Upper Tribunal will need High Court judges to hear them, and I intend to make such judges available to sit on those cases. However, it is imperative that there is flexibility in relation to the circumstances where cases should be transferred to the upper tribunal, and flexibility as to who they will be heard by&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07022051000324"></a>That flexibility would be disturbed if the Bill included a provision limiting such cases to High Court judges, regardless of the circumstances of the case. There are some persuasive examples of cases where judges of the upper tribunal will have the expertise to handle particular cases in the most appropriate way. Technical tax cases, for example, have been mentioned in the course of our discussions.</p>

<a name="70220-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07022051000097"></a>Given that Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 meet the requirements of the Lord Chief Justice, as well as those of the Government, I am pleased to be able to accept them. I am sure that, as the noble and learned Lord has said, as the Bill progresses, we will look again at Amendments Nos. 3 to 5. We will, of course, look at Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to make sure that we have got this absolutely right. I am delighted to accept Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for agreeing not to press Amendments Nos. 3 to 5.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07022051000106"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 6, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 7 to 10 and 15. In accepting the amendment tabled on Report by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, which restored to the Bill a clause governing mediation, I undertook to table consequential amendments at Third Reading to ensure that what is now Clause 24 fits properly back in. Amendment No. 6 tidies up the terminology to refer to all tribunal staff appointed under Clause 40(1), so that they can act as mediators wherever they work in the tribunals service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07022051000107"></a>Amendment No. 7 deletes Clause 24(6) to (9) to enable some restructuring of the role of ACAS and the payment of fees to mediators. Subsection (6), which requires consultation with ACAS before a practice direction can be made in relation to mediation, has been removed from Clause 24 because ACAS needs to be consulted only in employment cases.</p>

<a name="70220-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07022051000108"></a>Amendment No. 15 restores to Schedule 8 the provisions extending the mediation principles to the employment tribunals, which were originally included in Schedule 8 to the draft Bill. There are, however, some important differences. In subsection (4), the reference to tribunal staff has been broadened to include all tribunal staff. References to fees have been deleted&#151;I shall explain why shortly&#151;and the definition of member has been changed to make it clear that mediation may be carried out by members other than those assigned to the tribunal to hear the particular matter. I should explain that one provision that appears in the new Clause 24 has been omitted from the parallel provisions in Schedule 8. This is the stipulation that tribunal procedure rules or practice directions must be made with regard to the principles that mediation is to take place only by agreement between the parties in dispute, and that the failure of mediation is not to affect the outcome of the proceedings. This is a very deliberate distinction. It is accepted that the employment tribunals should remain outside the new tribunals structure, and that they will retain their own rules and policy priorities in some areas. This is due to their different character and their party versus party nature rather than their administrative nature.</p>

<a name="70220-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07022051000109"></a>The Department of Trade and Industry is currently undertaking a review of dispute resolution, which is due to report shortly. Against that background, we felt that it would be wrong to put anything in legislation now that might pre-empt the outcome of the review, or to fetter the discretion of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in this area. However, I emphasise that the omission of these provisions from Schedule 8 should not be taken to imply that the Government intend to force mediation on parties who are not willing to agree to it; it does not. Anything that the Government might eventually decide to do that changes the current position on mediation in employment tribunals would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1011"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1011</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70220-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07022051000110"></a>We decided to omit from Schedule 8 the provision that the failure of mediation is not to affect the outcome of the proceedings, because it would proscribe the use of an award uplift or reduction. The Department of Trade and Industry regards this as a legitimate tool to encourage settlement, and this is reflected in current arrangements under Section 31 of the Employment Act 2002. Under that provision, an employment tribunal may enhance or reduce an award dependent on the parties&#146; efforts on completion of the three-stage procedure. Again, we do not want to upset existing arrangements or to pre-empt the results of the review. Noble Lords may have seen an earlier version of the amendment to Schedule 8 in which the distinction between it and Clause 24 was not drawn. I apologise for any confusion that that may have caused.</p>

<a name="70220-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07022051000111"></a>Amendments Nos. 8 and 10 restructure the provisions on fees. Amendment No. 8 amends Clause 42 to enable the Lord Chancellor to prescribe by order the fees payable in respect of mediation conducted by any tribunal staff. This replaces the two references to fees in Clause 24 and Schedule 8. Amendment No. 10, to Clause 49, ensures that fees payable for mediation are subject to the negative procedure.</p>

<a name="70220-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07022051000112"></a>On orders setting fees for mediation by staff, the consultation draft of the Bill provided only that the orders be laid before Parliament. The Government believe that the negative procedure provides an appropriate level of control for orders setting the level of such fees, as the House has already accepted the principle that fees may be, but do not have to be, charged.</p>

<a name="70220-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07022051000113"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 9 was prompted by the mediation amendments and adds the words &#147;a resolution of&#148; after &#147;approved by&#148; to ensure clarity of the desired procedure before the House. I beg to move.</p>

I was going to quiz her about it but she has predicted that someone would, so I will not. Having met those conducting the review of employment tribunal matters only last week, I understand the noble Baroness&#146;s point and think it is a reasonable explanation of the difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07022051000116"></a>I have one other more general point, on which the answer may be clear to the lawyers who read the provisions but not to me. They seem to be couched in terms of which staff or members of tribunals can carry out mediation or receive fees for it. However, very few staff currently in the system will be trained in, or have experience of, mediation. Outside the tribunal service a significant number of people have experience in and are trained in mediation. If the Minister cannot give me an answer to my question off the cuff, I would like her to write to me. Is it envisaged that it will be possible to use people outside the service to provide mediation? It would seem sensible to at least provide for that opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07022051000128"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, perhaps I may start by being nice and saying that the Minister and her whole team have been immensely helpful in dealing with bailiff regulation since the Bill first appeared. I am grateful to them for their time and effort. However, I think that they have taken a severe wrong turning in trying to cobble together a regulator out of the Security Industry Authority and various other bits of legislation that they happen to have lying around. It will be extremely difficult to get it right and it will require a lot of perseverance and diplomacy to make it happen at all. The noble Baroness has those characteristics; I hope that she remains in her place for long enough to do it.</p>

<a name="70220-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07022051000129"></a>The Government have chosen to go for a mix of Security Industry Authority and existing DCA powers to try between them to provide for a regulator that will come up to scratch in regulating bailiffs. It will clearly take a long while to get there. Today I am aiming, not to impose on the noble Baroness my own idea of what a regulator should be&#151;I hope that this is a fight that will carry on into the Commons and that they might do that&#151;but to obtain from the Government a commitment to see the matter through to the end. Where we are now is where we began in 1992 when it first became apparent that bailiffs were misbehaving in their enforcement of poll-tax debts. That misbehaviour has carried on unabated; indeed, it has been exacerbated because so many more aspects of our lives are now frequently attended to by bailiffs, notably congestion charges and other incidental taxes on motorists. The more time passes and the more fixed penalties are invented to avoid lengthy procedures for our police force, the more bailiffs will come into the necessary matter of enforcement at the end of the day. From the many people who have written to me, I know that it is enormously important that that serial and compounded injustice is brought to an end in a way that preserves the revenue of the Government and their various offshoots and preserves the principle that those who are owed money should pay it. It is crucial to get that right.</p>

We all hope that we will go in the same direction; but I want a commitment. Paragraphs (a) and (b) are self-explanatory: not only are we looking for the individual bailiff to be regulated but also the people who control bailiffs; otherwise it is too easy to maintain the fiction that people are running a reputable bailiff business but allow individual bailiffs to misbehave below that. It must bite on those such as Equita, a subsidiary of Capita, which is a very reputable company. They must realise that they must behave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07022051000131"></a>It must involve setting standards of conduct which have consequences for a bailiff. It must be known both to the bailiff and to the people whom they are dealing with what standards of conduct are expected. That must be made evident at the beginning of the process, as the High Court bailiffs do now. The first part of the transaction is that the debtor is handed a leaflet or leaflets explaining the procedure and their

<a name="70220-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07022051000132"></a>The regulator must monitor performance. It must be an active regulator, but not an overbearing one. One or two of the smaller bailiffs have written to me to say that they really do not want a body that will charge them immense fees just for the pleasure of investigating them. I hope that the process will result in an industry that largely behaves; none the less, there must be monitoring.</p>

The reputation of the industry is being damaged even if we do not have an individual complaint&#148;, that would be a mischief also. How can one tell? This creature does not yet exist. I hope that it will be well regulated and perform better than the SIA in its early days. However, it has to be able to investigate complaints; otherwise it will have no teeth at all. If someone approaches a regulator saying that a bailiff has misbehaved and it can do nothing about it, then the regulator will have no effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07022051000137"></a>I want a commitment from the Government to an investigatory power and practice which is open and which goes beyond that which the SIA has chosen to exercise. The SIA does not tell those who have complained what the results of its actions have been, which seems entirely inappropriate in the case of bailiffs. At the end of the day, it must have the ability to exact fines or the cessation of licences in a way which hurts a serious business enough for it to sit up and take notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07022051000138"></a>On the other hand, I would not like to see bailiffs regulated in the way that teachers are regulated. If teachers have a complaint made against them, they are suspended and can spend one or two years sitting around waiting for adjudication. I do not think that is necessary in the case of bailiffs, except in extreme cases. Generally, if you are trusted to be a bailiff in the first place, you are trusted to continue in the business until you are found to have done wrong. I am looking

At an earlier stage the Minister said that there was no lack of will on the part of the Government to do something about regulation but there was some uncertainty about the mode of doing it most effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07022051000141"></a>The sole purpose of my intervention behind the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, whose work in this sphere has evoked admiration across the House, is simply to enquire whether the Government intend that the options on which they are consulting should not be confined by the timing for the remaining stages of the Bill, excluding the possibility of including provisions which satisfy the concerns expressed by many consumer bodies, including citizens&#146; advice, that the SIA is not, through a regulatory process that it might devise, necessarily the best way to proceed.</p>

<a name="70220-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07022051000142"></a>I hope that the Government will avail themselves of the opportunity to reach a conclusion on matters that have given rise to concern.

He has, as the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, said, worked tirelessly on this issue. He has held me to account in many ways and ensured that the Government have moved considerably to address his concerns. I am more than happy to give him as much commitment as I can, not on my own behalf, important though that may be, but on behalf of the Government, because it will be a team effort to bring in this provision. I said when we discussed this issue previously that we plan to lay the regulations by the summer. That is our timetable; it will be an important conclusion.</p>

However, we believe that we have the legislation in place and that we need to use the regulations in the Private Security Industry Act 2001 to enable us to do this. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is also right to say that we must make sure that we get the regulator right, which is what lies behind the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan. The regulator must be able to do the job. I have already made that commitment to those in the industry itself, who are of course keen to see this come into being. We will work as closely as we can

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07022051000145"></a>On the amendment before us, what I cannot commit to is a 12-month timescale because I do not yet know what the timetable will be. However, I can make a commitment to lay the regulations before Parliament. That in itself will give us another opportunity to consider and debate in more detail what is to happen. I hope that what I say now will satisfy the noble Lord and allow him to withdraw his amendment in the recognition that we are planning to do what he seeks to achieve.</p>

<a name="70220-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07022051000146"></a>Our proposal means that all enforcement agents who are not Crown employees will be licensed by the SIA and that there will be no exceptions. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, asked on Report whether there might be exceptions for some employees of large companies where a significant proportion of the employees are already licensed. That will not be the case. I should add that licensing will also apply to managers and supervisors in companies directing enforcement activity. Through regulations we want to drive up standards across the industry, in particular by setting strict competencies and conditions for those individuals who apply for a licence. On punishment for failure to comply with standards and redress, as I said on Report, a whole range of offences is set out in the Private Security Industry Act and specifies penalties where any person contravenes a condition of the licence granted to him. The penalty for this is a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, a fine not exceeding &#163;5,000, or both. The SIA also has the power to revoke or modify licences. These sanctions represent the most serious end of the scale, of course, and I understand that the SIA also uses sanctions such as written warnings and improvement notices as part of its compliance activity. Further details of those are set out in the enforcement policy code of practice.</p>

<a name="70220-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07022051000147"></a>Along with other regulators, the SIA is considering whether it wishes to take on additional or alternative powers as recommended by Professor Richard Macrory in his independent review of regulatory penalties. I agree with the noble Lord that it is vital for debtors to have access to a workable system for complaints and redress. My officials are committed, as are the Government, to developing appropriate procedures with their colleagues in the SIA and the Home Office as well as with stakeholders across the system. For example, we need to consider what role might be played by alternative dispute resolution in this. For a complaints system to be effective, debtors as well as enforcement agents need to be aware of their rights, particularly in relation to the powers available to agents. I believe the Bill is clearly drafted in this respect, but my department wants to ensure that information about these rights is clear and accessible to the public. This will be achieved through information leaflets and so forth. Finally, although Crown employees will be exempt from regulation, I am committed to ensuring a common set of standards and a common appearance across the enforcement industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07022051000154"></a>This group of amendments makes minor and consequential changes to Schedules 2 and 3. Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 are technical amendments required as a result of changes made on Report in the way that members of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal fit into the new tribunals. Noble Lords will recall that amendments to Clauses 4 and 5 were made on Report to clarify which legally qualified members of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal are to be considered judges of the first-tier tribunal and which are to be considered judges of the upper tribunal. The Government&#146;s intention, which is reflected in the Bill that we published in draft last July, is that only the president or deputy president or a senior immigration judge would sit as a judge of the upper tribunal. All other AIT judges are to be part of the first-tier tribunal only. In the process of redrafting the Bill for introduction in your Lordship&#146;s House, that visible distinction was lost. The amendments tabled on Report restored the distinction. Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 carry through those changes into Schedule 2.</p>

In order to cement their status as judges within the new system and the wider administrative justice system, it is intended that the oaths should be taken by all of the tribunal judiciary unless they have already done so as the result of holding an existing judicial office. Provisions in various parts of the Bill apply that requirement toall other judicial office holders. Paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 makes it clear that all deputy judges should take the oath. Amendment No. 14 completes the set by including those transferring in. I beg to move.</p>

I want to use the opportunity to note two ways in which I think the Government are going wrong in principle in the Bill, to urge them to use the Bill&#146;s progress in the Commons to think further on  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1019"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1019</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these matters, and perhaps to urge my colleagues in the Commons to take these matters seriously when they have the chance.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07022051000168"></a>The first issue is the use of force against the person. The Bill authorises regulations that will authorise the use of such force. That is an unnecessary and unhelpful evolution in the relationship between a bailiff and a debtor. I can see some arguments for that in theory but think it is something we will come to regret in practice. It is not the way in which a relationship should exist between a bailiff and a debtor. The use of force generally between the agents of the state and the citizen is something that we need to be very careful of. We have seen how easy it is to tread the wrong side of the line in several recent police cases. They have to exercise immense restraint in these circumstances. It is all too easy for something to go wrong. I do not think that this is a danger that we should introduce into bailiff legislation. Beyond anything else, I do not think it is really necessary. There is only a tiny constituency in the bailiff community that thinks that it might even be of use. I do not think that we should endanger our social arrangements. Once you allow this sort of thing, it has a tendency to become commonplace. I would not like to see that happen.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07022051000169"></a>Secondly, I would like to go back to some arguments we had in Committee and later concerning Semayne&#146;s case and related matters&#151;an Englishman&#146;s home is his castle, or not&#151;and to the basic principle, which I thought had largely been followed, that although a criminal fine derives from a criminal prosecution, the recoupment of a criminal fine is a civil matter. Those principles are transgressed by the idea&#151;which I agree is not new in this Bill but derives from an amendment made in 2004&#151;that criminal fines and certain government debts can allow bailiffs to force entry without a court order. We do not have the history on it yet, but that seems to me something that will turn out to be a step in the wrong direction. It should not be the relationship between a government and the governed that they can break into one&#146;s home without the matter having been carefully considered on an individual basis. If the use of these powers becomes at all commonplace, I believe that it will add&#151;in the way that many practices that we have allowed to grow up do&#151;to the discontentthat the citizen feels towards the Government and to the disillusionment with politicians and the political process.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07022051000170"></a>We have to recognise that just because we are the government and we are owed money it should not give us rights beyond those which accrue to somebody who is owed money in the ordinary way of things. We should not allow ourselves privileges of harm against the citizen that we do not allow other people and which disrupt the relationship and make it seem a more oppressive form of government than I should like to see. We have to be careful about doing damage through little things because it is in little things like this that the damage is done, not through some great big purpose to oppress the citizen. Damage is done through little things that allow the citizen to come off worse in circumstances where they ought to have a better right of justice and be treated better.</p>

This is a wrong turning and not a direction in which we should go. In the end it will be harmful to all our interests if we continue down this route. I look forward to the Government&#146;s reply.

I reassure the noble Lord, and trust that he will hold me to that as we progress from legislation to action&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 31/01/07; col. 272.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07022051000173"></a>The noble Baroness has now been sent a copyof the <I>Magistrates&#146; Courts Guidance&#151;Search andEntry Powers (Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004)</I>, which, as I said on Report, has 31 pages, on 15 of which paragraphs have been blacked out. One or two whole pages have been blacked out. They are secret instructions about which she obviously had not been informed. This was sent to the Reverend Paul Nicolson by the Access to Rights Unit at the DCA after he had sought a review of the department&#146;s decision not to tell him when the last resort had been reached that would enable a bailiff to break into domestic property to enforce a fine, who makes that decision and under what circumstances. Secret guidance of this kind is particularly worrying because, although this Government will not implement regulations allowing restraint of debtors by bailiffs unless necessary, any other Government of whatever hue might slip them in without telling anyone, while letting the circumstances of their implementation disappear into the invisible guidance.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07022051000174"></a>The noble Baroness has also been sent a copy of counsel&#146;s opinion on the department&#146;s decision and the invisible guidance by Alan Murdie, a barrister trustee of the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust. It is strange enough that there should be any secret instructions to a bailiff about how to break into a domestic property and seize goods, but it also seems that the grounds for withholding information under the exemptions allowed in the Freedom of Information Act are extremely flimsy. The information is withheld because it would be likely to prejudice the prevention or detection of crime under Section 31(1)(a) of the Freedom of

Bailiffs enforcing a fine have a court order to collect the money owing. There is nothing in that order that requires them to undertake &#147;Hercule Poirot&#148; activity and the detection of crime. Also, that section of the Freedom of Information Act does not apply in the present context, because enforcement of a fine is a civil matter, not a criminal one. Constitutionally and legally, fine enforcement is the collection of a debt payable to the Crown.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07022051000175"></a>Mr Murdie also says that it is important to note that until 27 March 2006, the law of bailiffs relating to fine enforcement could be established in law with sufficient clarity, and could be discovered by any interested citizen and their representative. Nothing was concealed, and the enforcement of justice was an open matter. He suggests that the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act and this Bill are not compliant with human rights law, in which the actions of the state affecting the citizen must be clear and be capable of being stated with certainty.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07022051000176"></a>He suggests too that there is a public interest in understanding what can be done if bailiffs act in a way, while enforcing a fine, that gives rise to a complaint. Unless citizens and their representatives know what procedures the Government require the bailiff to implement, they cannot know whether they have been kept. There are other points in his opinion, but I will not labour the point any further. I would be grateful if the noble Baroness could shed some light on a very puzzling and rather murky area of her department&#146;s decision-making.</p>

Noble Lords will recall that on Report we had a bit of confusion about the power of re-entry and about whether judicial authority should be available in that context. Noble Lords might recall, too, that one of the concerns was that some of the advice agencies were worried that if judicial authority were needed for re-entry to be enabled, that might encourage some bailiffs to take goods on the first visit. I have been looking at that, and we are in discussion with the industry and with the advice services. We have powers in paragraph 13(3) of Schedule 12 and paragraph 24(1) of Schedule 12 that would enable me to look at that through regulations to ensure that we deal with it appropriately when, for example, we are ensuring that we set out the criteria that should be followed the first time that people enter premises, so that it does not become a matter of course that they take goods on that first visit. Also, that would make getting judicial authority for a re-entry as simple and easy as possible, thereby reducing the incentive to take goods on the first visit. I wanted to say that at the beginning, because that was an area that we discussed at length, and I hope that I have tackled that.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07022051000178"></a>I hope that I can give the noble Lord some comfort on Amendment No. 19.

I want to

The regulations made under paragraphs 24(2) and 31(5) of Schedule 12 will be drawn up only after consultation with the advice sector and with the enforcement industry&#151;and that is another commitment. If after such consultation the consensus is that existing powers are sufficient, we will reconsider our position. I shall ensure that the noble Lord knows about that.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07022051000179"></a>However, I do not want to lose the flexibility in the Bill because, although some organisations have been concerned about it, others feel strongly that it is very important to set this out properly so that those who have to use the restraining powers do so properly and appropriately. We need to have that conversation; depending on the outcome, I shall undertake to act appropriately and accordingly and keep the noble Lord informed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07022051000180"></a>Amendment No. 16, as the noble Lord says, replicates the current law in the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1980, which is inserted by the Domestic Violence, Crimes and Victims Act 2004. The powers target those who have been convicted of a criminal offence, fined and who subsequently refuse to engage with the courts and pay the fine.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07022051000181"></a>It cannot be right that someone who has committed a criminal offence and received a sentence imposed by the courts can evade justice simply by refusing to open the door to an enforcement agent going about his lawful business. For a long time, non-payment of fines has been treated differently from non-payment of civil debts, with imprisonment still being available ultimately as a sanction for fine default. We think it is important to retain the powers set out in Schedule 4A to the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1980 as a key component of the enforcement tools available to those who have responsibility for enforcing criminal fines.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07022051000182"></a>In my earlier comments about how I intend to approach the matter I dealt with Amendments Nos. 17 and 18. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that.I shall not refer to the technicalities of these amendments for the precise reasons mentioned by the nobleLord.</p>

<a name="70220-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07022051000183"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, was kind enough to let me have his speaking note. I am the Minister responsible for freedom of information in the department. As the noble Lord knows, we have, under the Freedom of Information Act, the ability to withhold information, on the ground that sharing guidance to civilian enforcement officers on what to do in specific situations would prejudice the administration of justice. We think that the disclosure of methods used by enforcement agencies could assist defaulters to evade enforcement officers in the execution of their duties. That is why specific paragraphs were withheld. There is a risk that making the guidance more widely available would give an inappropriate advantage to defaulters by giving them an insight into the techniques used by enforcement officers. We are concerned to avoid a situation where our guidance is used by defaulters to avoid enforcement officers and, subsequently, their duty to pay financial penalties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07022051000184"></a>Of course, fines need to be enforced effectively. Wider publication of the guidance could impinge on the efficiency of the enforcement activity, and on that basis exemptions under Section 31(1)(c) of the FOI Act apply. There is no possibility, which I know the noble Lord is concerned about, of any other Government slipping in or implementing the provisions, as the regulations under paragraphs 24(2) and 31(5) of Schedule 12 are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. I think that if the Reverend Nicholson, who was in receipt of the letter, is discontent with the responses that he has had so far, he is entitled to pursue the matter with the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas. I hope that the noble Lord is satisfied with my answers.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07022051000201"></a>The Bill is set in the context of huge progress in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Fein ard fheis secured support for policing and justice; that certainly was a momentous moment. Support for policing is now in place. We have already seen the practical benefits on the ground, with Sinn Fein encouraging republicans to talk to the police. Indeed, I understand that, yesterday, Gerry Kelly attended and participated in a conference organised by the police in Northern Ireland. The latest Independent Monitoring Commission report confirmed the Provisional IRA&#146;s commitment to an exclusively political path.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07022051000202"></a>We find ourselves on the brink of restoring the power-sharing institutions, with the previously inconceivable prospect of Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party sitting down together in government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07022051000203"></a>Everyone knows that elections will be held on7 March; that is only just over two weeks away. We fully expect that power-sharing will follow by the deadline of 26 March. That date will not change. If it is not met, the chance will be lost for a generation. We therefore expect&#151;and, I think, can demand&#151;Northern Ireland politicians to continue to show the leadership that they have indeed shown up to this point. This Bill is part of the positive process of change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07022051000204"></a>The security situation in Northern Ireland has changed beyond recognition. Just last week, the Armed Forces started demolishing the last watchtower in south Armagh. Watchtowers are coming down and, as anyone who visits Northern Ireland will see, new offices and apartment buildings are going up all over the place. Ever more ambitious building projects are announced in Belfast. There is a peace dividend.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07022051000205"></a>This Bill is about reflecting those changes that people have seen to their everyday lives. What was appropriate for the 1970s is not appropriate today. The Bill therefore provides for a return, for the first time in nearly 40 years, to the presumption of trial by jury. As in the rest of the United Kingdom, jury trial in Northern Ireland will be the norm.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07022051000206"></a>However, despite this progress and optimism, there remains a threat that is particular to Northern Ireland. Some people remain wedded to the conflict of the past. A small number&#151;they are a small number&#151;of paramilitaries in the form of dissident republicans, and some loyalists, continue to blight communities. They clearly resent the success that has been achieved in Northern Ireland and want to undermine democracy, progress and the stability that comes from them. Inthe face of this threat, the safety and security ofthe people of Northern Ireland will always be the overwhelming priority for the Government. Given the chance, some people in Northern Ireland would seek to intimidate juries and therefore escape justice. For these reasons, the Bill provides for juror anonymity and restrictions on the disclosure of personal information about jurors. It also abolishes the defendant&#146;s right to peremptory challenge, bringing Northern Ireland into line with England and Wales.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07022051000207"></a>As in England and Wales, guidelines restricting the exercise of the prosecution&#146;s right of stand-by and the exercise of jury checks will ensure that there remains equality of arms. Other juror protection measures will be pursued administratively. These include better routine checks to identify disqualified jurors and making better use of screening of jurors from the public gallery. However, we recognise that these measures on their own are not sufficient to ensure that justice is done. The Bill therefore provides for a new system of non-jury trial, for use in a small number of exceptional cases. The Director of Public Prosecutions will be able to issue a certificate for non-jury trial, having taken the decision against a two-part statutory test. Importantly, the second part of that test states that there must be a risk to the administration of justice.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07022051000208"></a>We hope that the new system will see a continued reduction in the number of non-jury trials. We recognise that there is a legitimate public interest in this issue, so an annual statement on the number of non-jury trials in Northern Ireland under the new system will be made to Parliament. The system of non-jury trial will complement the Criminal Justice Act 2003. If a case does not meet the test in the Bill, which is focused on the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, it will still be possible to apply to the court for a non-jury trial under that Act.</p>

Routine military support to the police will cease. However, the military will remain available for certain specialised tasks in support of the civil authorities, consistent with its role in the rest of the United Kingdom; for example, in the conduct of search and rescue operations. Additionally, while the Armed Forces are not responsible for maintaining national security in the UK, they provide focused support in this area to the civil authorities.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07022051000210"></a>As envisaged by the Patten report, the police will be able to call on military support for public order situations if they require it. To provide this support, the military needs some limited statutory powers,as Northern Ireland remains a unique operating environment. Therefore, powers of entry, search, arrest and seizure, necessary for the military to carry out its role effectively, are included in the Bill. Without them, a soldier would have no more powers than the man in the street.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para14"></a>

We have sought to ensure that the powers are the minimum necessary for the police and Army to operate effectively and include appropriate safeguards. An independent reviewer will review operation of the legislation, and his or her reports will be laid before Parliament. Powers no longer necessary may be permanently removed from the statute by virtue of a power in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07022051000212"></a>Normalisation means a society that respects human rights; therefore, it continues to be important to provide the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission with appropriate powers to fulfil its role in protecting and promoting human rights. Following consultation, we have decided to enhance the commission&#146;s powers by providing it with powers to compel evidence, access places of detention and rely on the European Convention on Human Rights when initiating judicial proceedings. The commission already has the power to carry out investigations. A power to compel evidence and access places of detention enhances the effectiveness of these investigations. Giving the commission the power to rely on the European Convention on Human Rights in judicial reviews allows it to bring important test cases to clarify points of law in situations when it would not be appropriate for an individual victim to do so. The Bill will ensure that these powers are both used appropriately by the commission and complied with fully by public authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07022051000213"></a>The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee and the Independent Monitoring Commission have highlighted the problems of organised crime in the private security industry in Northern Ireland. The Bill will bring Northern Ireland into line with arrangements in the rest of the United Kingdom. The remit of the Security Industry Authority will be extended to Northern Ireland. This regime will put greater checks on the industry to ensure that those who work within it are properly qualified and fit to do so. This will lead to higher standards in the industry and increase competitiveness for Northern Ireland companies. However, both the Security Industry Authority and private security companies will need time to prepare for the change.

The interim scheme builds on the current arrangements. It is designed to bear down on the problems of criminal activity in the industry as well as paramilitary exploitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07022051000214"></a>The Bill includes a further model for devolution of policing and justice in Northern Ireland. The model provides for an elected Minister and deputy Minister and was devised following discussions with the Northern Ireland political parties. It represents, in the Government&#146;s view, the model most likely to achieve broad acceptability among the parties in the event that they prove unable themselves to agree a model. This model can therefore be implemented either by a decision of the Assembly, which would be a preferred choice, or by an Order in Council brought forward by the Secretary of State. This is a precautionary measure to ensure that any failure to agree on a model on the part of the Assembly does not stand as a barrier to further progress towards the May 2008 target for devolution as set out in the St Andrews agreement.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07022051000215"></a>I repeat that this model has been devised and brought forward following discussions with the Northern Ireland political parties. I assure the House that the power is not intended to trump or supersede the will of the Assembly. Our preference is for the Assembly to do it.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07022051000216"></a>There are some other minor but worthwhile changes in the Bill. A number of organisations have been added to the remit of the Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice in Northern Ireland. A technical change is being made to legal aid arrangements to provide maximum flexibility in the granting of publicly funded legal representation. The Bill also enables the renaming of resident magistrates helping to deliver one of the recommendations of the Criminal Justice Review.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07022051000217"></a>To conclude, the Bill marks a staging post on Northern Ireland&#146;s continued transition to normalisation and the journey towards the devolution of policing and justice. It ensures that, while recognising progress, we do not ignore the threat that still exists. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

However, it is a sad pity that whatever games Ministers have played in their youth, poker was not one of them. Sinn Fein/IRA on the other hand, like most terrorist organisations with a culture of communist-style negotiation, is a very good poker player. Why do we always have to make the concessions it wants before it has provided any quid pro quo other than some well publicised but meaningless statements&#151;and only statements of intent? The Government are preparing to relinquish the well-tried Diplock system and substitute a new system of non-jury trial, which is evidently

The Sixth Report of the Justice Oversight Commission of June 2006 says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="07022051000362"></a>&#147;The eventual future of the so-called Diplock courts was not a matter for the review to consider, nor has that been within the remit of the oversight work&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022051000318"></a>I wonder why.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07022051000221"></a>However, fortunately the review says later, in the chapter on juries, that although it noticed the decreasing figure in the number of people tried in Diplock courts and was concerned to maintain confidence in the jury system generally as more cases came to be sent to jury trial, it recommends:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="07022051000363"></a>&#147;We think that there are aspects of jury trials that should be reviewed including, inter alia, measures to prevent intimidation of jurors&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022051000222"></a>It refers also to the risk of intimidation not only to jurors but to others.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07022051000223"></a>My concern is that those who stand to benefit from any premature weakening of the Diplock system are the paramilitaries, and whether or not Sinn Fein/IRA has a political interest it will always be concerned to protect its sources of money and power in the community, including the purely criminal elements that provide both. It continues to be heavily involved in serious organised crime, and Sinn Fein/IRA in government will make each decision on this issue a political rather than a judicial matter. I therefore urge the Government to delay any new legislation that could be open to manipulation by Sinn Fein/IRA ministers until at least after the Assembly is up and running. If that is not possible, can we leave the way open to revoke it&#151;within the next two years if necessary?</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07022051000224"></a>I wait with interest to see what the human rights commission will do with its new powers. I know of no case in which the commission has intervened to protect victims of paramilitary intimidation, but I shall be glad to be proved wrong. The Independent Monitoring Commission has done infinitely more to bring such issues as the widespread victimisation by paramilitaries, leading to exile from the community, into the open. The IMC has consistently exposed that&#151;and I greatly honour the IMC for it&#151;and said that the culture of deference to Sinn Fein/IRA must end. It has attacked the way in which Sinn Fein/IRA uses membership of community restorative justice organs as a means of exerting local influence and continuing to achieve control in &#147;a more respectable guise&#148;. As the IMC says,</p>
<ul><a name="07022051000370"></a>&#147;it is essential that paramilitaries are not allowed to operate in this way.&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="07022051000225"></a>I hope that will be the effect of this Bill.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07022051000226"></a>My concern is that Sinn Fein/IRA is going to be allowed to get away with no more than some pious phrases. The PIRA leaders have persuaded their rank and file to make polite but noncommittal statements about the police because they also said, more frankly, that they would be able to take over the police and make it their own. They persuaded the Patten commission that the RUC was an enemy because it had very few Catholics in its ranks. Evidently, no one told the commission that that was because the very few Catholic officers and their families lived in fear of

So, the 50:50 rule was introduced and young Catholics came forward to join the new PSNI&#151;a very good thing. The press asked Gerry Adams what Sinn Fein&#146;s attitude would be to these new members of the police. &#147;What it always was&#148;, he replied. The first young graduate was shot and his family&#146;s home burnt down. Sinn Fein/IRA does not accept the law in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_spopq0"></a><a name="07022051000227"></a>Let us consider what has happened, or rather not happened, about the murder of Robert McCartney two years ago. I know that I have said this before, but I am saying it again. I asked Her Majesty&#146;s Government on 10 October 2005 whether the IRA had now, after considerable damage to its position in the US, allowed its people to testify in court and enable the McCartney case to be brought to trial. The IRA had earlier cheerfully offered, publicly, to shoot the offenders themselves and seemed to think that was an entirely normal proceeding in its role as supporters of the law. The Minister replied in a letter to me:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="07022051000364"></a>&#147;There is no evidence to suggest that the IRA leadership has issued an instruction to its members and associates to cooperate, although Sinn Fein/IRA has publicly called for those responsible to account for their actions. In the absence of such an instruction, the culture and history of the organization is such that cooperation with the establishment is anathema&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022051000319"></a>That was a thoroughly honest reply, and that month the last of the McCartney family moved out of their home because they could no longer bear the intimidation. They have since suffered it again, not once but twice in other communities, and are ostracised because they dared to criticise the IRA. When is that going to change?</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07022051000228"></a>Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have indeed condemned criminality and said vague and virtuous things about the rule of law. Until they not only allow but require witnesses to testify at a trial on the death of Robert McCartney, recognise that the public now has a 75 per cent level of confidence in the PSNI, and cease to intimidate Catholics who join, nothing will really change. The city of Omagh is also still unable to bring those who were guilty to justice because the IRA refuses to give leave to witnesses to testify in a British court. Northern Ireland is still within the United Kingdom. The IRA continues to inhibit the recruitment of Catholics to the police. It was recently reported that 99 new recruits had resigned over the past year and 76 of those gave as one of their reasons for so doing paramilitary intimidation. What have the PIRA leadership said or done about that?</p>

<a name="70220-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07022051000229"></a>The trouble is that we are dealing with a political party with the closest possible links with the highly effective criminal organisation it created, making it the richest party by far in elections north and south. It is also a party with a subliminal, but nevertheless real, machine for intimidation and electoral corruption, with an agenda&#151;the unification of the two countries&#151;it is determined to impose, although neither the Northern Irish nor the Irish electorate want it. We have a dutyto deliver what the people in both countries clearly said that they wanted at the time of the Belfast agreement: not a united Ireland, but two flourishing and friendly neighbours with many common yet distinct interests.</p>

We must under no circumstances pass legislation that would leave any legal action on the Saville report to the Assembly. We must face the fact that Sinn Fein/IRA is a very rich party, with a long history of successful ballot-rigging, electoral intimidation and corruption, which could still emerge as the more powerful party in the Assembly after the March elections. It will be so, not because of the will of the people, but because of the corrupt and intimidating tactics it will effortlessly employ.</p>

That is reflected in the region&#146;s vibrant economy. I well remember first visiting, 10 or more years ago, with the Police Negotiating Board. To show how much things have changed, we were not to breathe a word about who we were or why we were there. As I recall, we were a group of social workers visiting Belfast for a conference. Of course, we fooled no one, partly because I was one of only two women in the delegation of around 50 men; it was like that in those days, and has not changed enough in that regard since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07022051000232"></a>Progress towards devolution, however, has been remarkable. Discounting the inevitable hiccups along the way, we can now see light glimmering through the darkness of those terrible years. The time has come to place the future of Northern Ireland firmly in the hands of its own elected politicians. No one pretends that this transition will be easy or trouble free, but Northern Ireland&#146;s politicians must find the means of working together. Otherwise, as the Minister has reminded us, they face the unhappy prospect of direct rule, over which they will have little influence, for years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07022051000233"></a>The Bill, in parts, helps to deliver the justice and security measures needed to enable the process of normalisation to continue. While there is much in it that we on these Benches would support, there is also deep concern, especially over the first part of the Bill, dealing with trials on indictment without a jury.My noble friend Lord Lester will be speaking more fully on those matters. We have welcomed the Government&#146;s announcements of the repealing of the temporary provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000 for Northern Ireland, particularly Part VII. That is a great step forward, as is the movement away from the Diplock courts system, as far as it goes. However, I ask the Minister why the DPP alone for Northern Ireland can issue a certificate for a trial on indictment to be conducted without a jury.</p>

Jury trial ought to be the norm rather than the exception in Northern Ireland. I see that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, at Second Reading in the other

<ul><a name="07022051000371"></a>&#147;the DPP&#146;s decision is about the mode of trial, and the defendant will receive at least as fair a trial without a jury as with one, so they will not suffer any detriment&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 13/12/06; col. 894.]</ul>
<p><a name="07022051000235"></a>I beg to disagree. Even if the so-called juryless trials will not be the norm, we are trying to establish through this Bill that Northern Ireland justice will mirror that of the rest of the United Kingdom. I do not know of anywhere else where these rules prevail. I thought we understood that trial by jury was the norm. In the same debate the SDLP Member, Mark Durkan, stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="07022051000365"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State says that there are few Diplock courts. There should be none. An outcome should not turn on the opinion of one person, who may have some bias or may misapprehend the facts. In that situation, the accused can quickly become the convicted. Once an injustice has been done, it can be years, or more likely decades, before it is undone. We need only to consider cases such as that of Christy Walsh to understand what can go wrong&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 13/12/06; col. 919.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022051000236"></a>He made a very powerful point, with which I have much sympathy. There most definitely needs to be some form of judicial involvement in this matter. I hope that, in Committee, we will consider this. Weare particularly concerned about the contents of Clause 7, to which we are completely opposed. To have no provision for appeal against a decision in a trial held without a jury is completely unacceptable. It is a clear attack on a person&#146;s human rights and we will be seeking to remove this.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07022051000237"></a>Although it is not particularly relevant now, as changes have been made, something similar came up in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill in 2004. At the time the Joint Committee on Human Rights issued a damning report on the provision, which stated that the committee regarded the restriction proposed in the Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="07022051000366"></a>&#147;as being inherently objectionable as an attack on an important element of the scheme for protecting Convention rights in the United Kingdom&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07022051000238"></a>For me, the provisions of this clause are equally objectionable.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07022051000239"></a>Another of our concerns is that the language of the Bill is unhelpful. As in my earlier remarks about &#147;suspects,&#148; &#147;risk&#148; and &#147;might,&#148; so the term &#147;associate,&#148; used in Clause 1 (3)(b), and its definition in subsection (10), could mean almost anybody. It is defined as a friend or a relative, but that description is open to wide interpretation and we should find other ways of expressing more clearly what &#147;associate&#148; means.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07022051000240"></a>Other areas of the Bill test the Government&#146;s commitment to human rights, especially around the culture of unaccountability, which surrounds the security forces in Northern Ireland, especially MI5, whose role appears to be enhanced by this Bill. The Police Service of Northern Ireland, not MI5, should be the primary mover in security matters. Where is the normalcy in that? It may be that I am being nave on this point; perhaps Dr Reid wants to pilot this role for MI5 in Northern Ireland, prior to introducing it in the rest of the United Kingdom. It would not be the first time that policy changes trailed in Northern Ireland have later been imported into Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07022051000241"></a>If the PSNI remains the lead agency, as I strongly believe it should, the police ombudsman would continue to be able to look into any complaints and issue a report in the same way she normally does. I have not heard any serious complaints about how she has undertaken her role to date. Indeed, quite the opposite; it would give the people of Northern Ireland an assurance that any complaints they had about justice or security would be dealt with appropriately. On the other hand, who keeps an eye on what MI5 is doing in Northern Ireland? I simply ask the question.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07022051000242"></a>We agree with the Government that there is still a case for putting special measures in place to protect the identity of jurors in Northern Ireland. Clauses 13 to 19 provide for the extension of the powers of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which we welcome. Some time ago, the commission identified a need for it to be able to compel evidence and to enter places of detention, and we are glad that it now has these powers. We will, however, table amendments in Committee to probe how best the provisions can be used most effectively for the benefit of the communities in Northern Ireland. For example, Clause 15 would allow the commission to enter a place of detention only during, and for the purpose of, a formal time-bound investigation, established under Section 69(8) of the 1998 Act. For any other purpose, however serious or urgent, the commission would need to secure the permission of the relevant authorities. Such restrictions could hamper the effectiveness of the commission to carry out its statutory responsibilities.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07022051000243"></a>Moreover, although the Government&#146;s amendment to Clause 19 in another place on the timing of the implementation of these new powers is a step in the right direction, the clause could still present an obstacle to the commission in carrying out its functions. Even if the commission is to investigate alleged human rights violations arising only after August 2007, it is extremely likely to require access to evidence or documents existing before that date. The commission recently contributed to the exposure of the ill treatment of children and adults in a mental health institution in Northern Ireland. If the commission decided to conduct an effective investigation, it would be imperative to have access to previous records. It seems likely that, in a number of circumstances, the commission would need to investigate properly all the circumstances surrounding a particular matter if it were to do its job properly. It would need to consider evidence from the past. Surely we want the commission to be as effective as possible in its role.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07022051000244"></a>We welcome the changes to the powers of the security forces under Clauses 20 to 41, because these are general public order powers and are not restricted to terrorist offences. Having had the most peaceful marching season last year, when the Army was not deployed at all, as the Minister reminded us at the beginning of the debate, we sincerely hope that these powers will not need to be used in the future. Be that as it may, we would prefer Parliament to be involved in the process of determining whether they will be needed. We shall return to this as well in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07022051000245"></a>Clause 42 and Schedule 5 are new provisions that were added to the Bill on Report in another place. Liberal Democrats and their Liberal forebears have always been a devolutionist party, and were solong before Labour or the Conservatives. Indeed, the latter remain very ambivalent on this principle. Accordingly, we have supported for many years the principle of devolving policing and justice powers to the Assembly. I know that noble Lords on all sides of the House want the Assembly to be restored, and want local politicians from Northern Ireland taking decisions on the matters that affect the day-to-day lives of their people. We all want the Assembly to take responsibility for policing and justice in Northern Ireland. Perhaps Clause 42, which allows the Assembly more flexibility to decide on the exact construct of a department of justice and policing, is the right way to go about it. However, we want to ensure that the details of the proposal are helpful to the Assembly in deciding the best way to construct such a department. I would like reassurance that this is what the Government have in mind. I hope that the Government will leave it entirely to the Assembly to decide on this crucial matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07022051000246"></a>The Bill&#146;s remaining provisions and in particular Clause 46 relating to the regulation of the private security industry in Northern Ireland are to be warmly welcomed. The Security Industry Authority has been extremely successful in its work in England and Wales and will begin to give the people of Northern Ireland the confidence that only people who have passed the exacting test for a certificate to practise within the security industry will be allowed to do so and that proper monitoring of those provisions will be regularly undertaken.</p>

He reflected first on the moves that republicans have made to support the police and then said that the Government fully expected a resumption of the power-sharing Executive on 26 March. The language he used at that stage was significantly different from the language the Government were usingafter the meeting at St Andrews, when they said that there were two issues that had to be resolved: Sinn Fein&#146;s approach to policing and the willingness of the Democratic Unionist Party to enter into a power-sharing Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07022051000249"></a>It is to be regretted that those noble Lords who are closely related to the Democratic Unionist Party are not present with us today to give further guidance on the second issue. I hope that the Minister is right in his confidence that the Democratic Unionist Party is ready and willing to enter a power-sharing Executive on 26 March. Some of us may entertain a little scepticism about that, scepticism reinforced not just by experience but by the studied ambiguity of the

However, we shall wait and see what happens.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07022051000250"></a>I know from experience that the Minister will not want to say anything clear on this issue, and I see that he is nodding his head, so I shall leave him to his confident attitude on the matter and its underlying ambiguity. I have a certain sense of d&#233;j -vu about his first point on republican support for the police, because we discussed this issue at great length with republicans in 2003. Had certain circumstances and events occurred more favourably, had the Independent Commission on Decommissioning carried out its remit properly and had the Administration resumed in 2003 as we hoped, I am confident that, within a short period, republicans would have made the move that they have made in recent weeks and months.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07022051000251"></a>As mentioned in the debates, the republicans are and have been playing a game. They knew that support for policing was their last card and they have held it back. They could have put it on the table four years ago, had matters been handled better, but we have had a delay of some four years in seeing it on the table, and I understand the scepticism about the sincerity of republicans on the matter. There is only one way to find out whether they are genuine: to see what happens. However, there are some worrying circumstances.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07022051000252"></a>I was glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, mentioned community restorative justice schemes, a matter that should give the House considerable concern. It is regrettable that in the Bill, which covers such a wide range of issues, there is no provision for a legal basis for the operation of such schemes. It is not right that the Government should allow part of the criminal justice system to be contracted out to private people, with no effective legal safeguards for the protection of the human rights of those involved.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07022051000253"></a>As I look at the situation in Northern Ireland, the gravest source of threat to human rights is through the kangaroo courts of paramilitaries, which are now potentially being transmuted into community restorative justice schemes. The silence on that issue from the Government, particularly when we have this opportunity before us, is very concerning.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07022051000254"></a>The noble Baroness also mentioned the McCartney case. I speak from memory&#151;my source on this is the website under the name of Slugger O&#146;Toole; perhaps people should check my source. Slugger O&#146;Toole&#146;s website noted a day or two ago that, among those who had assented to the nomination of a Sinn Fein candidate, one Mr Alex Maskey, were two persons alleged to have been in the pub where Mr McCartney was on the occasion of the assault on him that resulted in his murder and who have not given statements to the police. A number of persons who were there have given statements but, according to Slugger O'Toole, those persons have not. The fact that two persons who were there in the pub who have not co-operated with the police are so close to the Sinn Fein candidate that they signed his nomination paper would not give one any great comfort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07022051000255"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, made clear her distaste for non-jury trials. I do not share that approach at all. In this debate, it is appropriate that we record our appreciation of the judges in Northern Ireland who, during the past 30 years, have sat in Diplock courts in very difficult circumstances. Despite the difficulties and dangers, they have managed during that time to deliver a good result. That must be said.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07022051000256"></a>No system is perfect. Any form of trial will occasionally result in mistakes being made. Over the years, I have had occasion to associate myself with a campaign to remedy a miscarriage of justice in a Diplock court which was not entirely successful, despite having the case sent to the Court of Appeal twice. Of the four defendants, we got three cleared but not the fourth, so there is still a miscarriage of justice in that respect. There may be other cases with which I am not familiar, but looking back over the past 30 to 40 years to see how Northern Ireland issues have been handled in the courts, the major miscarriages of justice have occurred in jury trials in England. We should reflect on that.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07022051000257"></a>Over the years in Northern Ireland, campaigns have been got up by paramilitaries, sometimes with popular support, about aspects of the legal system. Supergrasses were criticised; interrogation techniques were criticised; but there was no serious campaign for a return to juries. There has been no serious campaign in Northern Ireland over the years for a change to the single-judge Diplock court. Some people&#151;in my view, foolishly&#151;think that the courts would be better with three judges. I think that that is a profound mistake. It is interesting that there has never been any popular support for change to the process.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07022051000258"></a>I am glad to see that the main safeguards that existed in Diplock courts are reproduced in the Bill. Those safeguards are, first, that the judge must produce a written reasoned judgment where he deals with all the circumstances in the case and the evidence that has been presented. That is linked to the second safeguard: that there is an unlimited right of appeal to the Court of Appeal on any ground. That means that the judge knows that his judgment is liable to be thoroughly examined by three judges in the Court of Appeal and picked over by the lawyers looking for any possible flaw in his argument, and that they will be doing that without having had the benefit, as he had, of seeing the witnesses give evidence. That is a very significant safeguard.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07022051000259"></a>Over the years, I have read quite a few judgments given by judges in Diplock courts. The success ofthe Northern Ireland judiciary in producing good judgments that clearly stand up when examined must be recorded.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07022051000260"></a>The first part of the Bill is rolling over Diplock courts into a new context where there is a shift of emphasis in the decision, in that now the presumption is that there will be a jury trial unless the DPP issues a certificate. There are provisions on the grounds on which certificates might be given. I shall be interested, when we get to look at this more closely, to see the arguments for giving this to the DPP rather than, as heretofore, to the Attorney-General. I think that there  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1036"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1036</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would still be some advantage in giving it to the Attorney-General so that there is a person who has a degree of accountability here who could then give a view on the matter. I think that is significant.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07022051000261"></a>I want to focus on one issue regarding the conditions in Clause 1. Three of those conditions make reference to a linkage with a proscribed organisation. In deciding whether to have a non-jury trial, it is obvious that there should be a reference to proscribed organisations; that makes sense. What concerns me is the absence of any reference to serious organised crime. Some paramilitary organisations are now gradually transmuting themselves into organised crime gangs. Most of the organised crime gangs in Northern Ireland have paramilitary linkages&#151;most of them but not all. I am thinking of a report by the Independent Monitoring Commission in 2004, which said that of the most serious organised crime gangs, three quarters have linkages with paramilitary organisations but the other quarter do not. What happens there? The danger of attempting to nobble juries is just as great with organised crime in this context.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07022051000262"></a>The Government might reply that that can be covered under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which provides for an application for a non-jury trial where there is reason outside the context of terrorism to believe that the jury might be tampered with. However, there are significant differences between the procedure under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and that in Clause 1. We should bear in mind that we will have some organised criminal gangs in Northern Ireland that, because of a history linking them to paramilitaries, will come under the Bill, whereas others who do not have the history of a linkage with paramilitary gangs will come under the 2003 Act, with radically different procedures. That has not been well thought out and we might want to look at it.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07022051000263"></a>The Minister referred to some of the powers being preserved, primarily for the Army&#151;which term I prefer to the military, but that is another matter&#151;giving rise to the question why, if there are to be reviews of those powers, we are not going to have the familiar reviews of the operation of quasi-terrorist provisions? Over the years we have become accustomed to that; in fact, we have become accustomed not just to annual statements but to annual renewals and votes, so we should have more on that. The Minister might also like to consider whether it would be appropriate to have a sunset clause every five years or so to bring the whole matter back before the House to be periodically considered.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07022051000264"></a>I think that most of the attempts to safeguard jury members are sensible, but I was glad to see paragraph 6 of the Explanatory Notes refer to,</p>
<ul><a name="07022051000372"></a>&#147;reforms which it is considered will reduce the risk of juror intimidation and partisan juries&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07022051000265"></a>I was glad to see that reference to partisan juries. It is too often forgotten that when Diplock reported in 1973, while most of the emphasis was given to juror intimidation, there was also reference to the dangers that flow from partisan juries. It is not something one likes to advertise but it has to be said that in 1973 there was concern among senior officials in the administration of justice that there had been partisan

Indeed, some might regard some of the miscarriages of justice in jury trials in terrorist cases as coming into that category as well.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07022051000266"></a>That is particularly significant when considering religious or political hostility in subsections (6) and (7) of Clause 1. Subsection (6) relates to an offence that,</p>
<ul><a name="07022051000373"></a>&#147;was committed to any extent ... as a result of, in connection with or in response to religious or political hostility of one person or group of persons towards another person or group of persons&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07022051000267"></a>That goes into this territory. Part of the reason I mention it is that on this side of the water, as we say, given the terrorist problems that are now developing here, it would be appropriate for someone to think about whether there is a risk of having partisan juries. These situations may develop and if they do so it is better to have thought about them and to have something prepared beforehand rather than have to patch up what has happened afterwards. I shall not say much about the rest of the Bill. I have reservations regarding the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, but we can explore those in Committee.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07022051000268"></a>I must say that the Clause 42 provisions for the justice department astonished me. Had I any influence on those in the Northern Ireland Assembly, I would take grave exception to this. As things were originally planned, it was to be left to us in the Assembly to decide how we would structure departments. When active consideration was given to the question of the devolution of policing and justice in 2002 and 2003, we were happy to discuss with others what models would be necessary. Had the Government here started to prescribe models, even if they were just presented as models, I would have deeply resented it. I would also have deeply resented it had the Government taken powers to impose a model, as it were, on the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is getting desperately close to overriding the Assembly itself. The Minister disclaims that intention, but Clause 42 makes it obvious that we are going to see a little bit of spin: the Democratic Unionist Party will be assured that the triple lock has not been overridden and the Government are just bringing this forward for consideration. It will still be up to the party to decide whether or not to elect a Minister for justice; and of course Sinn Fein will be told, &#147;This is how hard we are pushing on the target date of May 2008. We are taking the power to enable us to put it in place if the Assembly does not agree&#148;. The obvious message underlying it is, &#147;When the time comes we may be prepared to go further and actually impose the devolution&#148;.</p>

<a name="70220-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07022051000269"></a>There is a strand of thinking among those in the DUP that they would be happy to operate something if it was imposed upon them rather than having to vote for it. I remember DUP members who said of the Belfast agreement that we should never have agreed to it. It would have been all right if it had been imposed on us, then we could have worked it, but somehow it was wrong for us to agree to it. I suspect that the same thing is happening again and what we are seeing is the beginning of a little ritual dance that will result in that. But I fear that the people of Northern Ireland will not be content with it. In fact, I have grave

Certainly their temper in recent times would indicate that they are not. I doubt very much whether things will change so dramatically in just over a year, but that is a matter we can pursue later.</p>

I want to make a number of points, particularly regarding the powers of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, as I believe that this Bill has serious defects in terms of the protection of human rights. In a number of respects the Bill actually diminishes the commission&#146;s current level of independence from the Government and imposesnew and onerous obligations. I was pleased to note that, in its recent scrutiny report on the Bill, theJoint Committee on Human Rights also shared my concerns.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07022051000271"></a>A number of relevant clauses have been presented by the Government as a positive response to recommendations made by the commission on improving its powers. However, the Bill offers access and evidential powers in a very limited form, hedging them with exclusions, limitations and procedural obligations and adding little value in the protection of human rights.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07022051000272"></a>There are three issues arising from this part of the Bill for the House to consider: restrictions on the use of evidential powers, including national security exclusions; fettering of access to places of detention; and the time limit on using new powers.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07022051000273"></a>Let us look at the first issue. Clause 14 provides for the power to compel evidence and obliges the commission to consider whether the matter that it proposes to investigate has not been investigated sufficiently by another person or agency. Clause 15 makes a similar provision in relation to places of detention. As a result of these restrictions, there is a danger that an agency could block an inspection by the commission on an urgent human rights issue by claiming that a similar investigation had been conducted by a regulatory body previously.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07022051000274"></a>As I understand it, the commission avoids duplication of work with other oversight and regulatory bodies through Memoranda of Understanding and other protocols. The commission bases its work on the international human rights standards and therefore brings a new perspective to situations, matters and institutions already investigated by bodies with a different focus. The activities of other oversight bodies should not create a ground to object to an investigation by the commission. Clauses 14 and 15 should be amended.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07022051000275"></a>The commission is of course subject to judicial review. It has no desire to remove itself from the legitimate scrutiny of the courts, such as the role of the county court, as proposed in this Bill. It is not apparent that the specific role that the Bill would give the county court would add to the protection of human rights. Notices should not be required to be ratified or  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1039"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1039</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>overturned at county court level. In particular, the ability of a county court to cancel an order, to prevent or restrict access or to interfere with the terms of reference of an investigation will undoubtedly limit the independence of the commission.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07022051000276"></a>Clause 14 also limits the capacity of the commission to investigate anything connected with national security. That takes no account of the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland as a society emerging from a prolonged conflict, in which human rights issues frequently arose in relation to the activities of the intelligence services and the police in relation to national security matters. For example, the alleged collusion between state agencies and illegal armed groups, as recently reported by the Police Ombudsman, is the sort of issue that a national rights institute ought to be able to address. In practice, this Bill could prevent any disclosure to the commission of information that would be relevant to that matter, whether relating to past, present or future activity.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07022051000277"></a>At present, there is no restriction in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 on the ability of the commission to investigate national security issues. This new provision reduces, rather than enhances, the commission&#146;s powers. The exclusion of intelligence matters is not limited to the application of the proposed powers. Any investigation by the commission, whether or not it seeks to compel evidence, is prohibited from considering any matter concerning human rights in relation to the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service and GCHQ.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07022051000278"></a>The commission has stated that it completely accepts that national security must be protected. It accepts the need to protect the capacity of the intelligence services and the police to defend national security within the rule of law. It understands that this may, in certain circumstances, justify a refusal to disclose certain information. Clearly, it is one thing to prevent sensitive information coming into the public domain; it is entirely another thing to prevent questions being raised.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07022051000279"></a>This clause, if retained in the Bill, is bound to diminish not only the commission&#146;s credibility but public confidence in the compliance of the intelligence services with human rights. Although I understand that virtually the same provisions were made in Schedule 2 to the Equality Act 2006, for the Commission for Equality and Human Rights in Britain, I still contend that the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland justify a different approach. Clause 14 should be amended.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07022051000280"></a>On the second major issue in this discussion, Clause 15 allows the commission to enter a place of detention only for the purpose of a formal, time-bound investigation. For any other purpose, however serious or urgent, the commission would need to secure the permission of the relevant authorities.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07022051000281"></a>In my view, the commission needs to have the option of visiting places of detention as a means of fulfilling its statutory functions in relation to legal proceedings, research, investigations and educational activities. For example, it may from time to time be made aware of a particular situation in a prison or holding centre which requires immediate attention,  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1040"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1040</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and to which the relevant authorities may not wish it to have access. The commission may also wish to review the operation of such a centre without the centre&#146;s staff having the benefit of preparing for the visit, and it should be able to make unannounced inspections. To be effective as a means of discouraging or uncovering human rights violations, the power of access to places of detention should allow for unannounced visits.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07022051000282"></a>As drafted, the Bill imposes a minimum delay of15 days&#146; notice between the commission decidingto investigate and gaining the right of entry.Subsection (5) makes no provision for emergencies and subsection (6) further delays access by allowing for application to the county court. The county court is able not only to prevent or restrict access but to dictate alterations to the terms of reference decided by the commission and communicated by it to all interested parties. I believe that these restrictions on accessing places of detention should be removed from the Bill.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07022051000283"></a>Clause 19 prevents the commission from compelling evidence or accessing a place of detention for the purpose of investigating any matter relating to the period before 1 August 2007. The commission could not, for example, require the production of a document created on or before 31 July 2007, even if it was directly relevant to a recent human rights violation. The effect of the time limit is particularly severe in relation to the gathering of evidence. It is difficult to imagine how any human rights violation could effectively be investigated without lookinginto events and information from previous years. Therefore, in practice, it is likely that several years would have to elapse before the commission could use the powers to any effect.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07022051000284"></a>The clause creates a notable anomaly in the protection of human rights in Northern Ireland as against other UK jurisdictions. In Great Britain, the existing equality bodies already have powers to compel evidence, and the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights acquires similar powers under the Equality Act 2006. The Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006 contains not only evidence powers but a right of entry to places of detention without any time restriction. Thus in England, Scotland and Wales, the sister bodies of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission have, and will have, powers that have no arbitrary time limit. In the Republic of Ireland also, the Irish Human Rights Commission, established in parallel with the Northern Ireland commission as a result of the Belfast agreement, has extensive powers to compel evidence with no such time limit. Members will be aware that the agreement and the corresponding treaty committed the two states to maintaining an equivalent level of protection of human rights in Northern Ireland and the Republic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07022051000285"></a>The Minister in another place, Paul Goggins, stated at Second Reading:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07022051000287"></a>I understand from the commission that, as a body guided by the United Nations Paris principles, it wishes to be able to determine for itself how best to direct its energy and its resources after weighing up the human rights importance of a particular matter. It may very well decide that a flagrant breach of human rights in the past is just as deserving of investigation as a possibly less serious breach in the future.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07022051000288"></a>Having regard to the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland as a society emerging from a long period of conflict, this House will want to consider whether the interests of normalisation, confidence-building and conflict resolution are better served by enabling or blocking the investigation of past human rights violations.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07022051000289"></a>Although I welcome the minor concession the Government have made on this issue, bringing forward the timing of the measure by six months, I believe that Clause 19 serves no useful purpose in the protection of human rights and should either beleft out or further amended to provide a positive formulation allowing the commission to exercise its powers in relation to matters arising before as well as after the commencement of the new Act.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07022051000290"></a>I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to amending this Bill and to take on board the criticisms made by the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.</p>

Since then, I have had the privilege of appearing in front of the Northern Irish courts on several occasions, and I am a blow-in of 33 years standing in Cork. I love the whole of Ireland, north and south. I would like to say at the very beginning that I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, especially on what he said about the courage and integrity of the Northern Ireland judiciary, which needs to be emphasised&#151;not only their bravery but their fearless independence and impartiality.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07022051000292"></a>Although I sit on the Liberal Democrat Benches, I am speaking today as a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and I shall not move a millimetre from its report. It is important that that all-party and beyond-party report should be carefully considered in this House. It could not be considered in the other place because it was published on12 February, so this is the first opportunity to draw attention to its proposals. The noble Baroness, Lady Blood, has already done so with great force in relation to the powers of the commissioner, which will enable me to be a bit shorter than I otherwise would have been. I also am grateful to officials from the Northern Ireland Office and from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, who have met me and others to discuss the issues. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to at least some of the concerns in the report in his reply today.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07022051000293"></a>I am more optimistic than my noble friend about the capacity to improve the Bill in Committee. If the Equality Bill was anything to go by, under the leadership of the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, we managed in Committee to make very substantial improvements. I may be considered an idiot, but I believe that the Minister is open-minded and that there will be considerable scope for dealing with some of these points in Committee.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07022051000294"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights raised three issues of main concern in its report. First, there was jury and non-jury trials, including the controversial ouster clause. Secondly, there was the powers of the commission, and thirdly there was the additional powers for the police and Army. Regarding juries and non-jury trials, I accept a great deal of what the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, said, but we accept the need for safeguards to protect juries from intimidation and for provision for trial without jury where there is a danger of jury tampering or perverse verdicts. We welcome the Bill&#146;s reinstatement of a presumption in favour of jury trials in Northern Ireland, and we report that any departure from that presumption should be tightly defined and demonstrably related to the general problem of intimidation and sectarianism in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07022051000295"></a>The Bill gives the Director of Public Prosecutions the power to issue a certificate stating that a trial is to be conducted without a jury if the DPP suspects that a number of specified conditions are met and if there is a risk that the administration of justice might be impaired if the trial were to be conducted with a jury. The committee is concerned with the width of the DPP&#146;s power to certify. He may do so, for example, if the defendant is or at any time has been a member of a proscribed organisation, or is an &#147;associate&#148; of such a person.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07022051000296"></a>The committee accepts the possible need for a departure from a presumption of jury trial where the defendant is or has been a member of a proscribed organisation. Like the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, we are concerned about the extension of this to &#147;associates&#148; of such people. The breadth of that power gives rise to a risk that the power to certify may be used arbitrarily and in a way that may discriminate unfairly against friends or relatives of members or former members of proscribed or formerly proscribed organisations. It is the kind of problem that arose in a case in which I was involved in Strasbourg called Tinnelly and McElduff v United Kingdom, involving blacklisting. We therefore recommend that the Bill be amended to remove the reference to &#147;associates&#148;. We also recommend by way of safeguards against arbitrariness that the DPP should be required to be satisfied that other less restrictive measures will not prevent jury tampering, and that the Bill should provide for judicial control.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07022051000297"></a>As regards the ouster clause, Clause 7 purports to exclude the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to entertain challenges to the DPP's decision to issue a certificate, including challenges to the legality of the decision. Although Clause 7 has been revised and is now subject to the Human Rights Act, in our view it still conflicts with Section 7 of the Human Rights Act, by which proceedings can be brought claiming  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1043"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1043</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that a public authority has infringed a convention right. The ouster clause raises the significant issue of the restriction of the right of access to courts, recognised as fundamental both to the common law and in the scheme of the convention by the European Court of Human Rights.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07022051000298"></a>The Bill as it stands would permit a legal challenge only on grounds of bad faith or dishonesty or for what are called &#147;other exceptional circumstances&#148;, and not because the DPP had no jurisdiction at all to deal with the matter or had committed a serious error in law. For example, if the DPP issued a certificate on the basis that someone belonged to an organisation which had in fact never been proscribed, it would be impossible to challenge the decision in court. The Government claim that they are merely putting on a statutory footing the current case law about challenging the Attorney-General&#146;s decision whether to approve a case as fit for trial by jury under the current framework of the Diplock courts.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07022051000299"></a>We explain in our report that a careful reading of the decision of the High Court of Northern Irelandin the Shuker case shows that the ouster clause in the Bill is identical to the argument made by the Attorney-General and rejected by the High Court in that case. We expressed our regret that we find the explanation given in the Explanatory Notes and by the Minister in his letter to the committee to be disingenuous&#151;we do not normally use language as strong as that&#151;and we point out that Clause 7(1) and (2) is an attempt to put into statutory form the very argument which was made by the Attorney-General and rejected by the High Court of Northern Ireland in Shuker.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07022051000300"></a>We also point out that Clause 7(2) goes far beyond what the High Court actually held in Shuker, which ruled out judicial review of such decisions on grounds of procedural unfairness and explicitly left open the possibility of judicial review being available on other grounds in circumstances of future cases.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07022051000301"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, is not a lawyer, but I also know that he is as capable as any lawyer of understanding the judgments of the Northern Irish courts. If the Minister could read paragraphs 25 to 27 of the judgment of the Lord Chief Justice for Northern Ireland, Sir Brian Kerr, and the Lord Justice of Appeal in Northern Ireland, Sir Anthony Campbell, he will find that the Government can well trust the courts of Northern Ireland to be extremely careful not to use judicial review to excess. In the judgment, they go out of their way to say, &#147;Let&#146;s be pragmatic; let&#146;s look at each case on its merits; let&#146;s not say we have no jurisdiction to have judicial review; let&#146;s exercise it only rarely, but we are by no means prepared to be fettered&#148;.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07022051000302"></a>The advice in Clause 7(2) shows a lack of confidence by the Government in the judges of Northern Ireland, who can well be left to deal with the problem on a case-by-case analysis. Clause 7(2), as my noble friend said, raises similar rule-of-law concerns to the previous attempt by the Government to include a similar ouster clause in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill. There are good reasons why  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1044"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1044</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>courts on judicial review should exercise restraint, as the courts in Northern Ireland have explained, but that does not justify a wide-ranging ouster of judicial review. It should be for the court to decide, in the circumstances of a particular case, whether the DPP has demonstrated that the issue raised cannot be determined by the court without disclosing information whose disclosure would harm the public interest. If the Minister reads the actual judgment, he will appreciate the force of what the committee has said.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07022051000303"></a>We welcome the Government&#146;s amendment in narrowing the scope of this clause, but we hope that the Government and this House will agree that the rule of law requires no less than the deletionof Clause 7 as it stands. The reference to &#147;other exceptional circumstances&#148; is too vague.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07022051000304"></a>The next issue we raise is the need for equal opportunity for the defence and the prosecution in conducting juror checks. We conclude in paragraph 1.46 of our report that, to avoid a breach of the principle of equality of arms, it would be necessary either to retain the defence&#146;s equivalent right of peremptory challenge or for the Crown to be prepared to disclose enough of the gist of the information obtained to support a challenge to a juror for cause. In other words, there must be a level playing field. We believe that a challenge for cause is capable of including a challenge on the basis that the juror is a security risk, susceptible to improper approaches or liable to be influenced in arriving at a verdict for political or sectarian reasons. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander in that matter.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07022051000305"></a>As regards the powers of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, we welcome Clause 13, which enables the commission to institute or intervene in human rights legal proceedings. That is the same as the position under the Equality Act for the Commissioner for Equality and Human Rights. This will enhance the commission's effectiveness in promoting and protecting human rights. However, we share the Northern Ireland commission&#146;s concerns about three matters, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Blood, referred in some detail. The first involves restrictions on the use of the commission's evidential powers, including &#147;national security&#148;; the second involves fettering of access to places of detention; and the third involves the time limit on using the new powers.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07022051000306"></a>We agree with the Northern Ireland Commission that it should not be prevented from investigating a matter on the ground that it has already been sufficiently investigated by someone else; we also agree that there should be no blanket ban preventing the commission from raising questions about the intelligence services in its investigations. In the Northern Ireland context, such a limitation would be a severe blow to the commission's credibility and effectiveness.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07022051000307"></a>As regards the fettering of access to places of detention, we also agree with the commission that the restrictions imposed by the Bill are too onerous to enable it to carry out its statutory responsibilities effectively. The commission points out that the importance of monitoring the strategic management of national security issues has been highlighted by the Police Ombudsman in her recent investigation into allegations  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1045"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1045</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of collusion between the police and their informants. The fetters proposed in the Bill make it very doubtful whether the commission could form part of the UK's national preventive mechanism under the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture. That is a matter on which the Government have not responded to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, although we asked it to do so. It would be a serious matter if the fetters prevented this commission from being able to play a part in that national preventive mechanism. There may be a misunderstanding among officials in this regard. Reference has been made to many other ways of inspecting&#151;for example, by the director of the Prison Service, by the National Audit Office or by others&#151;but, with respect, that is not really the point. The role of a national human rights institution in monitoring the human rights of prisoners and the associated regime is distinct from and complementary to an individual complaints mechanism such as that with the Prison Ombudsman or Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons. The matter can be dealt with, as the noble Baroness indicated, by protocols or memoranda of understanding, to avoid overlap. Again, that is an example of a completely unnecessary bureaucratic obstacle, which I suggest should be removed.</p>

<a name="70220-0007.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07022051000308"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blood, has already dealt with the time limit on using new powers; there are no such limits with respect to the CEHR or the Scottish Human Rights Commissioner or any other oversight body in Northern Ireland. We, like her, recommend that Clause 19 should be deleted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07022051000309"></a>Finally, I turn to the additional powers for the police and the military. The Bill gives them the power when on duty to stop a person &#147;for so long as is necessary&#148; to question him to ascertain his identity and movements. Members of the Armed Forces are also given a power to stop a person &#147;for so long as is necessary&#148; to question him to ascertain what he knows about a recent explosion or other recent incident endangering life, or about a person killed or injured in a recent explosion or incident. Bearing in mind that the member of the Armed Forces making the arrest must suspect that the person arrested has committed, was committing or was about to commit an offence, the JCHR believes that the arresting officer should be required at least to inform the detainee of the facts that are the foundation of the decision to detain and to ask whether he admits or denies the allegations. That should be an elementary requirement. It would reduce the risk of findings of incompatibility with Article 5.2 of the European convention in particular cases and avoid unnecessary litigation by lawyers such as me.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07022051000310"></a>We comment also on the breadth of the power of entry of premises and recommend that it should be expressed in objective terms, such as where the police officer or member of the armed services reasonably considers it necessary. That would reduce the risk of the power being found to be incompatible with Article 8 of the convention. We also recommend that there should be an equivalent requirement of authorisation by a senior officer where the power is exercised by a member of the Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07022051000311"></a>The Bill provides the police and Armed Forces with a power to enter and search premises to ascertain whether there are munitions unlawfully on the premises or wireless apparatus on premises where there is a reasonable suspicion that such items are present. It gives the officer who is carrying out such a search the power to require a person to remain on the premises for up to four hours, extendable to eight hours in total if he reasonably believes it necessary to carry out the search or prevent it being frustrated. We explain our reasons for doubting whether detention for up to eight hours during a search of premises is compatible with the right to liberty in Article 5 of the convention. However, we welcome the Minister&#146;s indication to us that he intends to make available a draft of the guidance on the use of these powers during the passage of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07022051000312"></a>We hope the Minister will reply to these concerns and indicate at what stage we will be provided with the draft of the guidance. We look forward, perhaps in Grand Committee, to being able to pursue these matters in a spirit of optimism and constructive assistance.</p>

We believe that this should be undertaken by a member of the judiciary.

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07022058000013"></a>The Opposition sincerely hope that the 26 March date will be achieved, but we have made it clear, along with others in Northern Ireland, that for devolution to work on a sustainable and durable basis requires all parties to abide by the same democratic principles. That has to mean support for the police, the courts and the rule of law. We welcome, therefore, the decision taken by Sinn Fein at its special party conference in Dublin at the end of January. I wish to make two points about that.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1048"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1048</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70220-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07022058000014"></a>First, in our view, there was never any justification for not supporting the police. Secondly, we on this side utterly deplore the smears levelled in recent weeks at the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reputation. We should never forget the professionalism, bravery and sacrifice of the Royal Ulster Constabulary during and in the face of a vicious terrorist campaign that saw 302 officers murdered and many more maimed or injured. Quite simply, without the RUC there would not have been a peace process or the prospect of a better future for all the people of Northern Ireland that we see today. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, and now the PSNI, deserve our thanks and praise for their excellent professionalism and work. For all that, the overwhelming vote by Sinn Fein finally to back the Police Service of Northern Ireland is a welcome step forward. Words are, however, only the start. We now have to judge performance; evidence of actions on the ground demonstrating that the republican movement is matching words and deeds.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07022058000015"></a>There have been some encouraging signs, with Sinn Fein urging people from republican communities in general&#151;and its own supporters in particular&#151;to co-operate in the investigation of certain crimes. There was also the meeting last week between senior members of Sinn Fein and the chief constable, Sir Hugh Orde. But there are still some ambiguities over the types of crime on which Sinn Fein is asking its supporters to co-operate with the police. For example, in his statement on 30 January the Sinn Fein president made distinctions between what he called &#147;civic&#148; and &#147;political&#148; policing. Judging from recent comments by Gerry Kelly, it is still not clear whether mainstream republicans are willing to co-operate with the PSNI in investigating the activities of so-called dissidents. Nor has Sinn Fein indicated that it expects its supporters to co-operate in investigating past crimes.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07022058000016"></a>There cannot be an   la carte approach to supporting the rule of law. Sinn Fein needs to back the police in investigating all crimes&#151;including the murder of Robert McCartney in 2005&#151;and to give active encouragement to people from republican backgrounds to join the police force. We have heard some negative stories about that this afternoon. If this is all forthcoming in the next few weeks, then we believe that unionists would be doing the right thing in committing themselves to entering a power-sharing devolved Administration at Stormont. However, given the lack of trust that exists in Northern Ireland, we do not underestimate the obstacles that must still be overcome, particularly on the future devolution of policing and justice powers to the Assembly.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07022058000017"></a>That leads me to the one part of the Bill over which we have serious concerns&#151;as do other noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Trimble. Clause 42 amends the amendment to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 in the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 effectively to give the Secretary of State the power to establish a policing and justice department over the heads of the Executive and the Assembly. That makes a mockery of devolution. For the record, we have never been opposed in principle to the devolution of policing and justice provided that there is sufficient community confidence for it to take place. Surely, the right way to test such community  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1049"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1049</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>confidence is to leave that matter to the Assembly on a cross-community vote, not to give the Secretary of State the vice-regal power to impose it whether or not the Assembly wants it. That is agreed by one or two other noble Lords. We shall see in Committee.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07022058000018"></a>We hope that these issues can be resolved by the parties once the elections are over. A devolved Government would mark yet another step forward in the transformation of Northern Ireland that has taken place over the past 15 years since John Major, with the help of my noble friend Lord Brooke and my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew, embarked on the first steps of what was to become the peace process. Today, most people are able to go about their daily lives in a way that was simply unimaginable in the early 1990s. The organisation responsible for most of the killings during the Troubles, the Provisional IRA, has decommissioned its weapons, formally ended its campaign and appears to be committed to a peaceful and democratic future.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07022058000019"></a>In the words of paragraph 2.17 of the Independent Monitoring Commission&#146;s report published on 30 January, which has already been quoted this afternoon:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="07022058000068"></a>&#147;The directions from the PIRA leadership to members have remained clear and consistent. Terrorism and violence have been abandoned. Members have been instructed not [to] be involved in paramilitary activities such as weapons procurement, in criminality or in the use of force. The organisation had already moved a very long way, and it has continued to move in the same direction in the three months under review. Instructions from the leadership of this kind reflect the continuing commitment to the strategy of following a political path to which we referred in our previous report and which we are fully satisfied remains firmly in place&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70220-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07022058000020"></a>As a result of all these developments, the Government have been able progressively to proceed with their security normalisation measures. Army bases have been closed; only last week we saw the dismantling of the watchtowers in Crossmaglen. The police are now able to patrol on foot in most parts of Northern Ireland. By the end of July, Operation Banner&#151;the longest continuous active service deployment in the British Army&#146;s history&#151;will come to an end. With that, the Part VII powers of the Terrorism Act 2000, specific to Northern Ireland and intended to be temporary, will be repealed.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07022058000021"></a>The Conservative Party welcomes all this but, for all the progress, we recognise that Northern Ireland still suffers from problems requiring the main measures in the Bill. As the IMC made clear in its most recent report, dissident republicans, Continuity IRA and the Real IRA, which are opposed to the strategy on which Sinn Fein is embarked, remain a potent threat, particularly in areas such as South Armagh and Fermanagh. On RIRA, the IMC referred to heightened levels of activity: an attack on a police vehicle, intimidation, sectarian attacks and incendiary attacks on DIY and other stores. The IMC attributes a number of paramilitary incidents to the Continuity IRA. It is in no doubt that both organisations are seeking to recruit, train and develop new weapons.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07022058000022"></a>Members of the two main loyalist organisations, the UDA and UVF, remain heavily involved in criminal and paramilitary activity. Despite some improvements, the IMC notes that,</p>
<ul><a name="07022058000070"></a>&#147;the pace of movement has been slow&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1050"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1050</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07022058000066"></a>There are still no indications that loyalist paramilitaries are prepared to decommission their weapons.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07022058000023"></a>In our view, the current levels of paramilitary threat in Northern Ireland more than justify this legislation, particularly the provisions giving additional powers to the Armed Forces and the police, and those relating to juries. While we all want a presumption in favour of trial by jury in criminal cases, we recognise that there will still need to be special provision for non-jury courts in certain circumstances. That is regrettable but necessary. However, we wonder, along with other noble Lords, whether the responsibility for issuing a certificate granting a non-jury trail should be for the Lord Chief Justice rather than the DPP; or, at the very least, whether the DPP ought to be obliged to consult and secure the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice before issuing a certificate. I suggest that we will have more of that in Committee. I note that the Criminal Justice Act 2003 requires the prosecution to apply to a judge for approval of a non-jury trial.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07022058000024"></a>We are also concerned, along with the noble Lords, Lord Trimble and Lord Smith of Clifton, about restorative justice and the systems being proposed. On the regulation of the private security industry, we welcome the fact that Northern Ireland is being brought into line with the rest of the United Kingdom. However, can we have an assurance from the Minister that the Security Industry Authority is fully equipped to meet the challenge posed by paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland? What assurances can he give us that problems encountered with stewarding at sporting events in England will not occur in Northern Ireland? The Minister nods; he knows what I am talking about.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07022058000025"></a>On the clauses relating to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, we question whether that body needs greater powers. When the commission chooses to involve itself in arguments over, for example, the 11-plus, there is surely more of a need for a clear definition of its responsibilities and the boundaries that it should not cross rather than increasing its scope, as the Bill does. In short&#151;I am afraid that some may not like what I am going to say&#151;we do not agree with much of what has been said on this subject in your Lordships&#146; House today and we look forward to continuing the debate in Committee. We will want to examine these issues in more detail. For now I reiterate that the Opposition recognise the need for the main provisions contained in the Bill and we shall support its Second Reading.</p>

Does the House find it acceptable that an excuse can be offered to the Minister, who finds it acceptable according to the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, when we are not vouchsafed in the House? I certainly do not. They have three Members; surely at least one of them could have attended. I find it quite uncalled for that the noble Lord should withdraw his remarks.</p>

Nobody spoke to me about it; I just happen to have been told yesterday that the DUP were launching their manifesto in Belfast today, hence their names were not on the speakers&#146; list. That may or may not be acceptable, but it is a fact. I am not critical one way or the other. I am not going to get involved in the Northern Ireland elections. There have been attempts to seduce me into this previously but I am not going down that road. People can speak for themselves, inside or outside this House.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07022058000029"></a>I promise not to speak for too long, but I hope to answer as many points as I can today because it will make Grand Committee more meaningful. Commitments have been given&#151;bearing in mind that I had an idea of what some noble Lords would say&#151;to try to put responses on record. That is important, but I will be time-limited in what I say. I am very grateful to everyone who has spoken for their points. This is a very important Bill. The changes we put on the statute book must reflect the changes in Northern Ireland in recent years.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07022058000030"></a>I will not bandy around too many statistics, but the impression of those outside of jury and non-jury trials in Northern Ireland is important. Over the past five years less than 6 per cent of all Crown Court cases have been tried without a jury under the Diplock system. The vast majority of criminal cases are tried in the magistrates&#146; court without a jury. The majority of Crown Court cases relate to fraud, rape, burglary, mugging, et cetera. The average number of cases dealt with using the Diplock system over the past five years is 64 a year; the provisional figure for 2006 was 61. In 2005 it was 49. This is very important. Obviously, non-jury trial is different, but nobody has claimed&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Trimble is right about miscarriages of justice&#151;that it is not a fair system. We are not talking about hundreds of cases each year but less than 6 per cent of Crown Court cases and an average of 64 per year.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07022058000031"></a>I fully accept, as the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, said, rebuilding&#151;or creating&#151;that trust is the key to success. We want everyone to come to the table and share the success of Northern Ireland so that every participant feels that they have got some success out of it. That requires trust. It is true that the trust is not there in every party. A network of trust must be built, and it will be built through the experience of working together and governing Northern Ireland. There is no question about that. No one is saying that things are perfect at the moment.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07022058000032"></a>I will check the Slugger O&#146;Toole website, which I am not familiar with. Notwithstanding what I am going to say in some detail to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, I will ensure that I read not only the substantial briefing that I have on the matter but the relevant paragraphs of the judgment to which he referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07022058000033"></a>Nothing in the Bill or in what we have said or done implies any lack of confidence in the judiciary. On behalf of the Government and the House, I pay tribute to the efforts of the judiciary over the past30 years. People have done an incredibly brave job in the circumstances. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, has said, 302 members of the police service have lost their lives, as have hundreds of other people. This has been a terrible tragedy. We are in a new position in Northern Ireland, and we must operate differently, but it is absolutely true that we must be mindful of the past. I am not a poker player, and I am not going to get involved in those aspects, but there have been negotiations. I have not been party to them, but we have got to where we are today: on the threshold of the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland. Elections will be held in two weeks from this Thursday, and will be followed, I hope, by the resumption of a power-sharing Executive on Monday 26 March. That is not far away. We will know in five short weeks or so whether it has worked. We do not have a plan B, although I freely admit that in the next few days&#151;I do not know when; perhaps it will be next week or the week after&#151;I will come before the House with an order to extend direct rule beyond 26 March. I must do so because of the six-monthly restoration order. I have no choice. It must be done like that because of the way in which Easter falls and because of the recess of the House, but it in no way undermines plan A, which is devolution. plan B is a generation missed. That is what we are saying.</p>

<a name="70220-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07022058000034"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Park, asked whether we would consider repealing the legislation in two years. The arrangements in the Bill which we mentioned are focused on the future and designed for Northern Ireland this century. The police and military powers can be repealed if they are no longer required. We believe that non-jury trials will wither on the vine over a period of years, although we cannot be prescriptive about that. As for other measures, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission powers and private security are all permanent and very positive developments. I have no doubt that we will return to these issues in time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07022058000035"></a>I mentioned Gerry Kelly&#146;s attendance at the conference only yesterday, as did others, but I am reluctant to bandy about quotations or add to what others have said. There has been a change in the climate and in Sinn Fein&#146;s attitudes towards policing, to the point where it has met that test and surmounted that hurdle, and neither I nor the Government seek to erect any further hurdles. I fully accept that the proof of the pudding will be what happens on the ground. It will be tested on a case-by-case basis. Those who look at these things day by day will see whether Sinn Fein delivers. The people involved have that responsibility and know that they will be tested. They must pass all those tests. If they do not, we have a problem. It does not help if I say that someone said this and someone else said that. All the quotations are on the record, and they are common currency in Northern Ireland. As I said, the test has been passed, which is why we are where we are now: on the verge of devolved government.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07022058000036"></a>On criminal activity, I can only refer to what I said in my opening remarks. I quote from the Independent Monitoring Commission&#146;s 13th report, which was published on 30 January this year, in which it said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="07022058000069"></a>&#147;PIRA as an organisation continues not to be involved and there are indications that in response to the leadership the involvement of individual members has declined. Nevertheless, some continue to be engaged in crime, including offences such as smuggling, fuel laundering and tax evasion. Such activity is now contrary to the policy of the organisation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022058000067"></a>We have to test that quotation against the reality.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07022058000037"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, asked about non-jury trial arrangements in Northern Ireland in respect of the rest of the United Kingdom. We think that Northern Ireland is on the road to normalisation; we are positive about that, but it is not yet the same as the rest of the UK. We fully accept that. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, made that abundantly clear and I agree with what he said. There is still a threat from loyalists and dissident republicans, and people live in small, close-knit communities in Northern Ireland. The dispersal of the population is different from that in the rest of the United Kingdom. It is not analogous to England, rural Wales or rural Scotland. Those communities are therefore vulnerable to paramilitary control. One day we hope that it will be as safe as the rest of the United Kingdom; it is not there yet. The Bill is helping us to deal with it on the way.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07022058000038"></a>The noble Baroness asked why we could not have a judicial process like that in the Criminal JusticeAct 2003, to which other colleagues referred. We believe that we have designed a system focused on the circumstances in Northern Ireland. An administrative system would enable us to protect the intelligence material that will provide the basis of many of the arguments in favour of non-jury trials. We must also make sure that we can protect the sensitive intelligence material that will form the basis of the arguments of a non-jury trial. In a judicial process we would have to share that with the defence. The only other way to protect it would be by the use of special advocates, but that is not ideal. Special advocates are a scarce resource for use in exceptional circumstances, not routine cases. It seems to us that in this instance an administrative process is desirable.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07022058000039"></a>The Northern Ireland courts in Shuker decided that that type of decision was one on which, par excellence, the court should be reluctant to intrude. That is the point. The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, suggested that the decision be made not by the DPP but maybe by the Attorney-General. We are reluctant to put forward the case that a Minister in London should decide, in effect, the mode of trial. That is what the decision is; it is about the mode of trial. It is not going to be about the fairness of the trial because no one is going to argue about that. We have enough experience in non-jury trials; it is about the mode of trial. I do not think that it would be satisfactory for a Minister in London to do that; the DPP in Northern Ireland is highly respected.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07022058000040"></a>I turn to Clause 7. I will not get into the legalistic points, although no doubt I will in Committee. Ministers do not consider it an ouster clause in the sense of the other legislation, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, in this House either last year or  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1054"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1054</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the year before. The clause restricts challenges to the Director of Public Prosecution&#146;s decision to cases where there has been bad faith, dishonesty or other exceptional circumstances. That places the current case law about reviews of the Attorney-General&#146;s decision not to de-schedule in Diplock cases on a statutory footing. That comes from the Shuker case, to which the noble Lord referred. That case confirmed that the procedure for determining the mode of trial of the accused is not a process suitable for the full panoply of judicial review.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07022058000041"></a>A case would be reviewable, however, on grounds such as bad faith or dishonesty. The clause is not a change from the current position. In any event, the DPP&#146;s decision is on the mode of trial. The defendant will receive at least as fair a trial without a jury as with one and he or she will suffer no detriment.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07022058000042"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blood, asked why the Human Rights Commission was prevented from looking at the past. I cannot match up all the points. Given the way in which noble Lords raised the issues, it is best if I go through their speeches individually. The restriction at Clause 19 applies only to the new powers to compel evidence. The commission will be able to investigate matters from the past as has been the case for the past eight years.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07022058000043"></a>It will be able to call for information from the past, using the Freedom of Information Act, as it can now. However, in granting those significant new powers, we think that it is right today to direct the use of the new powers towards the investigation of current human rights issues. That is the best way to ensure that the commission makes a positive contribution to the future position of human rights in Northern Ireland. We could be stepping very close to the bounds of retrospective legislation, if we are not careful, and I do not think that anyone wants to go down that road. My noble friend Lady Blood asked about the powers of the Human Rights Commission. They will figure largely, and I should rather deal with them in substantial detail in Grand Committee, where we will have a lot more time.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07022058000044"></a>On deciding the model for the devolved department of justice in the Assembly, to which several colleagues have referred, we do not intend to force anything on the Assembly. That is not the Government's desire. We want it to be done locally. I fully accept some of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, regarding his erstwhile colleagues from the unionist family, if I may put it that way&#151;that we will work it, but it is best if it is forced on us. I do not know whether that was what he was saying, but I can fully understand that being the case. Over the years, when I was in the other place, if there was something that we wanted but did not want to call for, if it was forced on us, it was easier to deliver locally. That may or may not be a good thing.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07022058000045"></a>We do not want to force anything on the Assembly, but we would not want to have progress falter over the inability to reach agreement on a specific departmental model. So our strong preference is for the Assembly to agree on the model. Make no question about that. The Assembly should first agree on the model. If it is unable to do so, the model in the Bill has been devised  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1055"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1055</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>after discussion with the Northern Ireland political parties. In the Government's humble view, that represents the best chance of achieving broad acceptance if the Assembly cannot agree on an alternative. If it can agree on an alternative, that is fine.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07022058000046"></a>Of course, that is not necessarily a long-term approach. It has been designed to help the Assembly in the early days of devolution. It will be difficult for the Assembly Members. They will all stand for election and hope to be elected to help to run Northern Ireland. It will not be easy. Since the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, has been in this House, he has given us chapter and verse of the joy and, sometimes, difficulty of taking those decisions. It will not be easy. If we as the Government and as Parliament at Westminster can do anything to make some of those early decisions easier, which can later be amended by the Assembly when trust starts to work and it gels together, that must be a good thing. That is not the Government overriding the legislation for the devolution of policing and criminal justice&#151;far from it.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07022058000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, referred to the fact that Clause 1 refers in three of its limbs&#151;its subsections&#151;to proscribed organisations but not to organised crime. I fully accept the powerful point that he made, but if organised crime is connected with a paramilitary group, the test will be met and a case could be tried without a jury. Because Northern Ireland is changing, where there was not organised crime in the past, it has mutated into a different form. We must deal with that as and when it arises. Our view is that if there is information and intelligence that an organised crime case is connected with a paramilitary group, the test in Clause 1 will be met.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07022058000048"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the opportunity to review the powers annually, or frequently. The Bill provides a power for the Secretary of State to repeal the Armed Forces and police powers by order. Reports of the independent reviewer and the continued monitoring of the use of the powers will provide sufficient transparency concerning the ongoing need for their use. The Secretary of State will seek to ensure that powers remain at the bare minimum necessary for the operational effectiveness of both the police and the Armed Forces by repealing any powers that become unnecessary. So we will repeal any powers that are no longer necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07022058000049"></a>On the primacy of national security, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, referred, the change that we are making will bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom and provide a consistent and coordinated response across the UK to the threat from terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07022058000050"></a>Before I turn to the issue of the Joint Committee, let me deal with an issue that has been referred to by more than one noble Lord&#151;the issue of community-based restorative justice. We note the concerns which have been raised many times in this House and with Ministers about the operation of community-based restorative justice schemes during the two periods of public consultation. It is clear that such schemes will have to comply fully with the rule of law. On 5 February 2007,  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1056"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1056</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>just a week or so ago, the Government published the Protocol for Community-based Restorative Justice Schemes. The protocol establishes a structure that will provide for effective engagement between community-based schemes and the criminal justice system in dealing with low-level offending, which has the police at the centre of the process and includes stringent safeguards to protect the rights of both victims and offenders. The Government have invited expressions of interest from schemes wishing to adopt the protocol and therefore begin the process of seeking formal accreditation. It has always been our position that formal accreditation of these schemes must involve the police at the centre and that the rules must be followed. I suspect that it has taken a lot longer than we initially intended, but that is where we are at the moment. We put that out for consultation only a couple of weeks ago. I hope that I have covered Clause 42. We will certainly go over it in considerable detail in Committee.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07022058000051"></a>I turn now to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Lester. I am grateful for all the speeches, all of which have been wholly positive and very helpful to those who will advise me in Committee on how to deal with the pressure points. As for safeguards against decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the argument is that the discretion may be exercised arbitrarily. The DPP is a trusted figure in Northern Ireland. He has conducted himself in an exemplary manner in taking decisions in some of the most difficult criminal cases in the history of Northern Ireland. We have confidence in his decision-making. He will be required to apply the test in the Bill&#151;it is a stringent one&#151;in making any decision for a non-jury trial. That decision will be challengeable, albeit in limited circumstances, and it will be for the courts to decide whether a challenge is possible based on the circumstances of each case. As I have said before, the DPP&#146;s decision is between two different modes of trial; it is not about the outcome of the case. Guilt or innocence will be determined at the trial.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07022058000052"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights says that allowing non-jury trial for associates of members of proscribed organisations is too broad a provision. We genuinely note concerns about that. However, we are trying to deal with a situation where a terrorist might use their contacts and a position of influence to secure the acquittal of a relative or close friend. Many of the cases where it is alleged that jury intimidation has occurred have involved actions on behalf of the defendant by an associate rather than direct actions by the defendant themselves. That is borne out by the Northern Ireland Crime Survey 2003-04, which reported that intimidation of victims does not always come from the defendant themselves. The Joint Committee has accepted in principle the need for a non-jury trial where there is a danger of jury-tampering or perverse verdicts. Such a risk exists in relation to associates. The DPP will be able to issue a certificate for non-jury trial where he is satisfied that there might be a risk to the administration of justice. This will help to ensure that there is non-jury only trial where it is needed. There will be exceptional cases. We accept that the terms &#147;friend&#148; and &#147;relative&#148; are broad; this is deliberate. The DPP will take into account the quality of the relationship when  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1057"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1057</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>forming a view about the potential risk to the administration of justice. For example, one could be estranged from one&#146;s parents but very close to a second cousin.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07022058000053"></a>To have a test that did not permit non-jury trial in the circumstances that I outlined involving potential tampering by associates could put jurors and their families at risk of intimidation and could lead to an unfair trial. That is the risk, and it is completely unacceptable. The whole point is that we want the trial to be fair. We would prefer that it was with a jury. The presumption is for jury trials; that is our starting point. But in the most exceptional circumstances, where there is a risk of the trial not being fair because of interference with the administration of justice, we would go with the DPP&#146;s decision for a non-jury trial.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07022058000054"></a>The DPP would need to be satisfied that other measures are inadequate before issuing a certificate for a non-jury trial&#151;a point which was raised by the committee. The Bill contains a number of measures designed to reduce the risk and fear of jury intimidation. Other juror protection measures that do not require legislative change, such as increased use of screens from the public parts of courtrooms, are planned. However, we recognise that in exceptional circumstances these measures will not be able fully to address the problem of juror intimidation. For example, the screening and balloting of jurors by number rather than by name will not prevent jurors being recognised by the defendant or while entering and leaving the court building. In a small jurisdiction such as Northern Ireland, the only other measures that could be taken, such as relocation, would have such a large impact on the life of the juror and his or her family that it is too high a price to pay. It is important to recognise that the jury reforms will be available for all cases, not just those where intimidation is considered possible.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07022058000055"></a>On the question of whether the decision of the DPP should be a judicial one&#151;a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, who said that it should be the decision of the Lord Chief Justice&#151;we think that the DPP is in the best position to assess the risk. The decision will be akin to the decision on whether to prosecute; it is that kind of judgment. On a scale of decision-making, it is more akin to the decision to prosecute. We do not believe that it is a decision to be taken by the Lord Chief Justice for Northern Ireland or by judges. The DPP already makes decisions about mode of trial in Northern Ireland and the provision will sit well within that. We believe that we have designed a system that focuses on the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland. An administrative system will enable us to protect the intelligence material that will provide the basis of many of the arguments in favour of a non-jury trial. In a judicial process we would have to share that material with the defence. As I said, the only other way to protect this material would be by the use of special advocates, and that is not ideal. In the case of Shuker, the Northern Ireland courts themselves decided that this type of decision is one that, par excellence, the courts should be reluctant to intrude into. As I said, I will go into that in greater detail in Committee. And as I said to the noble Lord, I will read the judgment itself.</p>

I would be grateful if the Minister would consider the following point: if he can give either on judicial review, on the basis of what was said in Shuker, or involve the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, either of those solutions might be practical. The removal of both gives rise to the problem.</p>

<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="07022058000057"></a><b><a name="70220-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07022058000082"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, I accept that; clearly I shall have to come before the Grand Committee briefed to deal with it. This is not a question for decision at Second Reading. These are issues of concern to the Joint Committee and they must be treated seriously. I am being reminded by my noble friend and colleague Lady Farrington that she will hit me if I do not sit down in a moment.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07022058000058"></a>I want to make a further point in response to the noble Lord, Lord Lester. Paragraphs 1.88 and 1.89 of the Joint Committee report suggest that the Bill should require members of the Armed Forces to state reasons for arrest. The Armed Forces power of arrest is limited to four hours. Within that time and as soon as possible the person will be rearrested by a police officer who has been trained to read to the individual their rights and cite what offence they are being arrested for. So I hope that people will be told why they are being arrested. It would not be possible to train members of the Armed Forces to the same standard as a police officer, particularly given that these powers will be used very rarely. Although the Armed Forces currently give a broad description of why they are arresting someone, throwing a petrol bomb for example, it is not necessary or easy to turn this into a statutory obligation. Re-arrest within four hours by the police means that the power is human rights compliant. I accept that the noble Lordis worried about cases leading to declarations of incompatibility, but we are confident that that will not happen. The Army has been using similar powers for years without such a declaration. There is a bit of history to this; it is not new.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07022058000059"></a>In the last part of the Joint Committee document, paragraph 1.96 refers to powers to ensure that searches for munitions and transmitters are not disrupted and may not be compliant with Article 5 of the convention, on the right to liberty. These powers normally amount to a restriction of liberty rather than detention. The important distinction was recognised by the House of Lords in recent case law. Where Article 5 of the ECHR is engaged, the power can be justified in terms of seeking to secure the fulfilment of an obligation proscribed by law and to safeguard the public in explosives cases. We intend to provide some further guidance on exercising that power.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07022058000060"></a>It is essential to remember that these powers are necessary to ensure the safety of the officers involved and the public. They will be used in a limited manner and only when necessary. There are other points, and I accept that I have not answered all of them, but they will certainly come to Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07022058000061"></a>I need to answer two points made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, as a courtesy. On whether the Security Industry Authority is equipped to deal with paramilitaries, we are confidant that it can meet the  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1059"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column 1059</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>challenge. Officials are working with the SIA and the police to address the issue. I realise that there have been some administration and bureaucracy issues, with a lot of last-minute applications, which is always the case and can lead to difficulties.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07022058000062"></a>The noble Lord mentioned small venues which are not covered by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and asked whether they will be burdened with SIA regulation. We do not wish to place unnecessary burdens on smaller sports venues in Northern Ireland, but we are obliged to ensure the safety and security of all citizens in Northern Ireland. Our officials are in discussion with the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland about the issue. It is a matter that will require further consideration.</p>

<a name="70220-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07022058000063"></a>As for whether stewards will be covered by the legislation, the Security Industry Authority considers the full range of activities that an individual performs when deciding whether they are to be licensed. For

These activities would be licensable only if they were undertaken together with a manned guarding activity. I have lots of brief on definitions of manned guarding activity, but we do not need to go into that now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07022058000064"></a>I am grateful for the contributions that we have received. I sincerely hope that we will have a successful Grand Committee. There is a fair amount of time between now and the first Grand Committee sitting; I do not have the date but it is a few weeks away. There is enough time for informal discussions and for amendments to be suggested. We are open, as is known, to making officials available to Members to see what they want to achieve, what is possible and whether we can have the necessary debate.</p>

<p><a name="07022052000009"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 2, 17, 103 and 18. What a select band we are in this Room this afternoon. It is particularly nice to see the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, in his place among us, because he so often puts his parliamentary duties before his health. Clearly his health is such that he can be with us today; I am delighted with that, because he has enormous experience in the area that we are about to discuss.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000010"></a>The first amendment in this group may seem to many Members of the Committee rather aggressive. It is not meant to be. My noble friend and I tabled it to get an early opportunity to hear the Government&#146;s response to some very basic questions. We have heard a great deal, all of which I entirely agree with, about the benefits that we have seen in another place, and I hope will see here, concerning a consensual approach to the difficult issues to be debated, and I hope resolved, during our discussions on the Bill.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000011"></a>Unfortunately, some of the largest issues that I hope to be debate are difficult to introduce, as they revolve around what is not in the Bill rather than what is. Members of the Committee with a better knowledge of Latin than me may remember that Caesar, in his <I>Commentaries on the Gallic Wars&#151;</I>perhaps in volume one or two&#151;commented that men worry more about what they cannot see than about what they can. The Government have been unusually co-operative in laying before your Lordships draft copies of many of the regulations that the Bill will empower, along with extensive explanatory material. I am sure that all Members of the Committee are as grateful as I am for that. Although those have been extremely helpful, the Government have been silent on one of the most important questions that the Bill has raised; namely, what the new benefit levels will be. I hope that Members of the Committee will bear with me as I go through the many questions that arise out of that, which the Minister must surely appreciate.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000012"></a>The basic question obviously has a significant impact on not only new claimants of ESA, but those who must eventually migrate from the old system to the new. The Government have promised that the basic allowance plus the support component will be greater than long-term incapacity benefit. However, I have failed to ascertain whether that is with or without premiums. The notes on the draft regulations suggest that they will continue. If so, for how long? I observe that the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, is as confused on the matter as I am, otherwise he would not have tabled Amendment No. 18.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000013"></a>Next&#151;I may be jumping the gun a little&#151;Iam particularly concerned about two words inparagraphs 5(2)(a) and 6(2) of Schedule 4. The schedule states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07022052000092"></a>&#147;Regulations may ... make provision for the purpose of securing that an award of an employment and support allowance that falls to be made on matching terms is made on terms which match in whole or part the award that would have been made in pursuance of a further claim to the existing benefit&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022052000088"></a>I would be grateful for an explanation of what &#147;in ... part&#148; means in that context. It has been taken by many of the lobby groups as basing all future levels of ESA benefit on the lowest possible measure of the old. For example, it seems that the assessment phase level is set against the lowest level possible of JSA, and that the support benefit is set against incapacity benefit, both being stripped of all premiums, which in reality are significant elements of both benefits. That is especially relevant to the group of disabled people aged 16 to 24. Let us assume that the first day of operation of ESA is 1 April&#151;before noble Lords reach for their diaries, I am well aware that this year1 April falls on a Saturday but I ask them to bear with me&#151;and let us further assume that it is a Monday. Will a young person on IB on 31 March get the same or less than the equivalent young person who starts his claim on 1 April and, as is hoped, has it completed 12 weeks later?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000014"></a>These questions, in particular, are vital when it comes to migration. This is the area where the Government have given us the least information and I hope that they will be able to remedy that over the next few sittings. There has been much debate over how long migration is expected to take. &#147;As resources allow&#148;&#151;words that are whistling round Whitehall at the moment&#151;is a similarly flexible phrase. There is also much confusion over how claimants will be treated during migration. I understand that those currently claiming IB will not be moved to the lower assessment phase benefit as this will represent a significant loss of benefit for those 13 weeks. However, can the Government clarify whether these migrants will have to undergo a PCA to confirm to which group they will finally be assigned? After all, it is not impossible that the new descriptors will lead to many people currently on the higher level long-term IB being newly assessed as not being limited for work-related activity.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000015"></a>Another complication here is the application of linking rules. A correspondent whom I mentioned on Second Reading has raised concerns over how these will apply. The situation is clear enough with those who are on ESA, but what of migrants? Let us suppose  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that a current claimant on long-term IB manages to find employment, so comes off the benefit just as ESA is rolled out under him. On losing that job within two years, he should return to a similar level of benefit, presumably as a support component under the new regime. Can the Minister explain whether he will remain free from conditionality, as is the case for new claimants receiving that level of benefit?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000016"></a>Then, to complicate the story even further, let us suppose that after a time he again finds himself employed&#151;again, for less than two years. Will he continue to be returned to the support group? When do the Government intend to require PCAs from these migrants? I suppose that here it is appropriate to mention the employment grant of &#163;40 a month for those coming into work. Will they get several dollops of this, or will it be limited to a 24-month working period or what? I repeat that I am referring to someone who is in and out of work. There is also the possibility of self-migration. In other words, can the Minister confirm that current claimants who are actively seeking to migrate&#151;particularly those with mental health and learning disabilities, who have available greater support, such as personal advisers&#151;are also able to migrate, as the notes on regulations suggest?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000017"></a>Moving away from questions surrounding migration, I return to the issue of where levels will be set. I understand that the basic allowance, as awarded during the assessment phase, will be similar to the basic jobseeker&#146;s allowance&#151;so similar, in fact, that it will be less for young people over the age of 25 but more if they are a couple. Can the Minister explain why these distinctions are being continued into the assessment period when they have been rejected for the period afterwards? That seems illogical. Why, indeed, do the Government want it both ways? Surely it would be clearer and cleaner for them to decide whether a distinction is or is not to be made on the grounds of age.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000018"></a>Another surprise on reading the material is that the Government are planning to continue so many premiums into this new regime for the income-related ESA. Severe disability is mentioned as an example; this seems an unnecessary complication given that the new benefit already has a more generous payment to the severely disabled or ill claimants in the form of the support component. Why does that benefit not already encompass that premium?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000019"></a>I should also like clarification on whether these premiums, presumably along with passported benefits such as free prescriptions, will be extended over the assessment phase for new claimants. The explanatory material seems to suggest that they do, but how will that be managed? Claimants will not yet have been assessed as to the need of any benefits relating to their disability at that point.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000020"></a>There is also the question of child-related premiums and passported benefits, such as the enhanced disability premium or free school meals. Of course, I can understand the need to continue with the premiums while that area is reformed, but I hope that the Minister can reassure me that premiums will be withdrawn as soon as possible and absorbed instead into what is

We are in the process of trying to get clarification and probing, and here we are exploring what will happen to the premiums in income support and how they will be dealt with. In other words, will anyone lose out on this? Clarification on this point will help us find out exactly what the situation is, and I hope that the Minister&#146;s answer will allay certain fears that undoubtedly exist out there, because we simply do not know exactly what is going to happen.</p>

<p><a name="07022052000023"></a>There is not really much else to say here other than that there are fears and worries related to the changeover.

I look forward to his answer.</p>

There are people, including my noble friend Lord Morris, who have been engaged in these matters for many years, and the approach taken in the other place, at Second Reading here and in the engagement since bodes well for the issues that we have to address.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000025"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said, these amendments are designed to explore the Government's intentions regarding the rate and payment of the employment and support allowance, for both new and existing customers. Pathways to Work pilots have already demonstrated that, with the right help and support, many people on incapacity benefits can move back into work, reinforcing our view that labelling people on incapacity benefits as incapable of work is wrong and damaging. This, coupled with the complexity and structure of incapacity benefits, works against our intention to help people focus on their aspirations.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000026"></a>Our intention, as your Lordships know, is to replace the current system of incapacity benefits with the new employment and support allowance. Unlike current incapacity benefits, the new allowance will rightly focus on how we can help people into work and will not automatically assume that because a person has a significant health condition or disability they are incapable of work. We believe that that is the right approach, which has been broadly welcomed by many organisations representing people with ill health and disabilities as well as by Members of this Chamber on Second Reading and throughout all parties in the other place.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000027"></a>With your Lordships&#146; agreement, I shall address some of the issues more fully and seek to answereach of the questions that has been raised.  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Amendment No. 1 would remove the first subsection of Clause 1, which introduces the new employment and support allowance and establishes that it will be payable subject to the provisions of Part 1. This is a fundamental part of the Bill which is essential in establishing a new system of hope and support to help give sick and disabled people the opportunity to make the most of their capacity.</p>
<h5><a name="07022052000100"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000028"></a>Amendment No. 2 seeks to remove Clause 1(3)(e) and (f). These paragraphs set out that for a customer to be entitled to employment and support allowance, they cannot simultaneously be entitled to income support or jobseeker's allowance. The amendment, as I understand it, looks at our intention regarding entitlement to employment and support allowance and the possible additional access to other income-related benefits. Indeed, the noble Lord confirmed that.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000029"></a>The new employment and support allowance is not structured in the same way as the old incapacity benefit, where incapacity benefit may in certain circumstances be topped up with income support. Instead, employment and support allowance is an integrated benefit, where a customer need apply only once and can, if necessary, receive both strands of the allowance.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000030"></a>As the noble Lord recognised, no final decisions have yet been made on the exact rate for the main phase of the benefit. However, as the Government have previously made clear, the main phase rate of benefit&#151;the basic allowance for someone on the contributory benefit or for a single person on the income-related benefit plus the work-related activity component&#151;will be higher than the current long-term rate of incapacity benefit, and those on the support group will receive a higher amount. Above that rate, people in the most financial need will continue to receive premiums such as the enhanced or severe disability premiums, where appropriate.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000031"></a>For some people only one benefit will be available. However, for others there will be a choice. For example, a lone parent who also has a disability may be able to claim either income support or employment and support allowance. In such circumstances, we believe that a customer should only be able to claim one of the two benefits. To be paid two benefitsat once would lead to duplication of provision, creating an inappropriate and significant burden on the taxpayer. The purpose of these paragraphs in Clause 1, therefore, is to ensure that that does not happen. This is common to other social security legislation, such as the jobseeker&#146;s allowance.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000032"></a>However, noble Lords will know that in the current system income support is not the only source of help that the Government provide to people on low incomes, and we intend to bring similar provisions forward for people on ESA. For example, people on income-related ESA will have automatic access to full housing benefit and council tax benefit; and we expect that customers on income-related ESA will also have access to a range of other passported benefits, such as prescription charges or free school  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>meals. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, has tabled a separate amendment on these issues, and I am sure that we will discuss them in more detail later.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000033"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 17. Clause 4 provides for the calculation of the applicable amount, which is the amount of benefit a customer will receive if he, or his partner, has no income. If they do have income, the applicable amount will be reduced by the amount of that income. I believe that the intention behind Amendment No. 17 is to probe our intentions, rather than to remove the amount altogether, which of course would be the effect of the amendment.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000034"></a>As I have already said, the applicable amount for income-related ESA includes the personal allowance for the customer and any partner and, from the14th week of the claim, either the work-related activity component or the support component where the PCA is satisfied. The applicable amount also includes the enhanced disability premium, severe disability premium, pensioner premium and, where appropriate, the carer premium. It will also include certain housing costs such as mortgage interest and service charges, which are currently payable as part of income support.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000035"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 18, I recognise the concerns noble Lords have about the benefit position of disabled people who would previously have qualified for the disability premium. However, the employment and support allowance introduces a new structure to the benefits for people with limited capability for work. That cannot be compared directly with past systems. Where a customer meets the personal capability assessment threshold, the new benefit provides that, after an initial assessment phase of 13 weeks, a work-related activity component or a support component will be payable. We should recognise that for most people that is considerably earlier than under the current arrangements, where the higher rates of benefit are payable after a year of incapacity.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000036"></a>This amendment means that the disability premium will continue to be payable in addition to the work-related activity component or the support component. In our view, the new structure of ESA better supports our aim of encouraging people with a limited capability for work to engage in work-related activity where they can. In addition, disabled people with additional needs will still have access to a range of appropriate income-related premiums, as I spelled out. The new arrangements provide that many people will receive additional support far sooner than under the outdated arrangements of the past.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000037"></a>Amendment No. 103 removes paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 4, which allows us to apply the linking rules to people leaving the benefit under prescribed circumstances and then returning to that benefit within two years. At Second Reading, I was clear that people migrating to employment and support allowance as part of the mandatory process from the existing system would maintain the same cash level of benefit.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000038"></a>As has been made clear during the passage of the Bill, it is our intention that, over time and as resources allow, existing incapacity benefit cases will be migrated across to the employment and support allowance, so that they too may benefit from the new complementary structure of benefit and support, which will also help to smooth administration and reduce complexity.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000039"></a>We want to migrate existing customers on to the new regime as resources allow, but we need to do so in a controlled manner. Therefore, we do not intend to start the mandatory migration process immediately at the commencement of the employment and support allowance. This is consistent with previous changes of this scale and will allow us to make sure that the new process is bedded down, to make sure the migration is as smooth as possible for customers and to reduce the risks around such a large undertaking.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000040"></a>We believe that it is right to migrate first those with children and those who have been on benefit for the shortest time, as we want to help families with children return to work to lift them out of poverty and to prevent long-term benefit dependency before it arises. However, depending on what evidence comes out of the Pathways to Work extension pilots, before we begin migration we will of course refine and if necessary change this strategy in line with the evidence we have. In the interim, as has been the case in all the Pathways to Work pilots from their inception, anyone already on incapacity benefits may volunteer for any appropriate support we offer.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000041"></a>We propose that, until the mandatory migration process starts, existing customers will remain on their current benefit and current linking rules will apply. Therefore, if someone leaves incapacity benefits they will return to their current benefit, as now. However, once the mandatory migration starts we will be in a position to provide the complementary support provided by the employment and support allowance to existing cases, so at that stage it would be appropriate for people returning to benefit on linking rules to return to employment and support allowance, but they would return to the same level of benefit as they left.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000042"></a>We believe that our approach with the new employment and support allowance is right. These amendments add nothing to the Bill as drafted. Powers elsewhere within Part 1 provide for the entitlement to thenew allowance. They enable us to move away from a culture of incapacity and despair to a new regime of rights and responsibilities, where there is opportunity for all.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000043"></a>I shall seek to answer some of the residual questions from noble Lords. If I fail to cover them, I hope noble Lords will press me on the matter. On the issue of linking rules and existing cases, until the mandatory migration process starts, the current linking rules will apply to existing customers. If someone leaves IB, he will return to it.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000044"></a>I was asked why we are having young people&#146;s rates in the assessment phase but not in the main phase. We have made it clear that we do not want to make any assumptions about a person before the main medical assessments have been satisfied in the first three months of the benefit. That is why the assessment phase rates are based on basic jobseeker&#146;s allowance personal allowance rates. Once in the main phase, customers will receive the same rates regardless of age.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000045"></a>The issue of the PCA for existing customers was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. We are still reviewing and testing the new PCA and, once that is finished, we will be in a better position to say what  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is the most appropriate stage to introduce it for existing customers. We expect that it will be at the first PCA review following migration to the ESA.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000046"></a>It has been suggested that our policy is not clear, and that there is no new detail. It is not possible at this stage to give every last shred of detail, because I do not want to commit prematurely to something that turns out not to work. However, we need to develop our proposals in line with the evidence.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000047"></a>There were questions about what will happen in the ESA to 16 and 17 year-olds who receive disability premium, and will get the 18 to 24 year-old personal allowance rate at the moment. Many young ESA customers will have access to the higher main phase rate of benefit earlier in the ESA than they would under the current system. It is a question of introducing a balance into these new allowances.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000048"></a>The noble Lord asked what &#147;in whole or part&#148; means in Schedule 4 in relation to matching terms. Schedule 4 contains wide powers to allow us to make sure we can move people smoothly from one benefit to another. Because the structures of the ESA and the IB and IS are different, it is important that we have that flexibility. It has also been clear that we want to simplify rules wherever possible, while protecting customers&#146; cash level benefits.</p>

<p><a name="07022052000049"></a>I hope that has dealt with each of the points raised, but if noble Lords would please press me again, I will certainly have another go. Subject to that, I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Will that also apply to the regime previous to incapacity benefit; that is, invalidity benefit? We now have almost an archaeology of disability benefits, and because some of the older ones, particularly invalidity benefit, were sometimes more generous and certainly gave greater security, there is a real reluctance among the holders of those benefits to risk exposure to the labour market, or to anything that seems to suggest that they may not be able to return to their incapacity or invalidity benefit. Instead of seeking to re-enter work, they seek instead to retain their benefit.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000060"></a>At the beginning of his answer, the Minister referred to the pilot Access to Work schemes&#151;on which all this is predicated, is it not? Some time ago, I asked the noble Lord's predecessor a Question for Written Answer. I asked how many people who had been on these  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pilots had not volunteered. I will not read out the whole Answer because I knew what it was when I asked the Question. The Answer is &#147;none&#148;. Therefore, in encouraging disabled people to have access to work and to discover what work is all about and so forth, I find it odd that pilots are relied on. Pilots do not prove anything; they merely show that there are volunteers who have had gainful employment and think that they have the opportunity of gainful employment, but they do not do much for the great bulk of people on IB with whom we are concerned.</p>

I do not have the data readily to hand, although they are in the file here somewhere, but comparisons have been made of people in Pathways areas and non-Pathways areas who have reached employment and moved off incapacity benefit, and the process has helped them. Even if you did not have the data to support that, conceptually, looking at what is entailed in all this, it is certain that these processes help people. We are engaging with them in a positive way and helping to deliver on their aspirations rather than paying them for not engaging and forgetting about them.</p>

It is a general point. I suspect that the Government will not find the scheme quite as successful as the results of the pilots have led us all&#151;me included&#151;to believe.</p>

Some of our correspondents have pointed out that the higher rate of invalidity benefit is &#163;80 a week, whereas the average in receipt is more like &#163;90 a week. Therefore, one wonders whether the levels will be closer to the average or the minimum. By the look on his face, the Minister is not prepared to answer that, so I had better move on fairly swiftly.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000071"></a>The Minister went on to say that there would be no topping up, as ESA is an integrated benefit, but that there would be enhanced disability benefit, if I understood him correctly. I am grateful, too, for that. Is the income support element to lose the disability premium of income support? That worries certain of my correspondents. I am glad to hear that at least some of the passported benefits will be continued&#151;for example, housing benefit, council tax benefit, prescription charges, and presumably eye and teeth tests and those sorts of things. I also noted that the disability premium was to continue.</p>

The disability premium will not survive under the new arrangements because of the new structure of the benefit, but in the income-related amount the components can include the enhanced disability premium, the severe disability premium, the pensioner premium and the carer premium where appropriate. The pensioner premium is an overlapping benefit in that calculation. Those premiums will survive.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000075"></a>As for linking rules, I understood the Minister to say that, when there was a break, the customer would go back to the same level of benefit income as they had before they went into work; I hope that I have that one right anyway. However, he did not rise to the challenge of my question about the &#163;40 back-to-work grant or whatever it is technically called; that will suffice for the moment. Clearly, a broken work pattern would mean that people would lose the &#163;40 for periods when they were not in work. Does the &#163;40 continue for 24 months of work activity or do people start again at the beginning of the &#163;40 period when they get back into work, having been off work for a period?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>

If somebody goes into work, that starts a 12-month period; if they come out of work, it ceases. If they go back into the system and start work again, the clock starts again on that 12-month period. I stress that the payment is due only when salary levels are at &#163;15,000 and below.</p>

I had not appreciated that point; the voluminous papers on the Bill did not make it clear that the grant was for 12 months rather than 24. Never mind.</p>

<p><a name="07022052000079"></a>I am extremely grateful to the Minister. I am sure that we will return to these and linked subjects throughout the afternoon&#146;s proceedings. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07022052000095"></a>&#147;Service users</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07022052000096"></a>(1) This section applies where a person in receipt of employment and support allowance who is a service user is asked by a public, charitable or educational body concernedwith health or social care to advise on service standards and delivery.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07022052000098"></a>(3) In this section &#147;service user&#148; means a person with recent experience of using or requiring public services relating to their ill-health, disability or caring responsibilities.&#148;</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000084"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 3 introduces a new clause whose purpose is to remove the benefit disincentives to service users who are benefit claimants and who act in an advisory capacity for public services. The new clause states that users of health and social care services who may under the Bill become recipients of ESA and who agree to be involved with advising a health or social care provider should not be treated as fit for work just because of  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC13"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this involvement if the fee paid, plus reimbursed expenses that are treated as earnings, exceeds the current limit.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000085"></a>The reason that this is an important point is that it is an explicit requirement of the disability equality duty, which has been a statutory obligation for public bodies since the beginning of December last year. That duty requires public bodies to produce the disability equality scheme, setting out the actions they will take to address the barriers to equality faced by disabled people within a particular service. Central to the DES&#146;s development is the involvement of disabled people. This is in addition to guidance issued by the Department of Health specifying that service users and carers who use social care or health services must be involved in all parts of the design and delivery of social work education and training. Many of these service users will have severe health or disability problems and are likely to be in receipt of ESA when it is introduced.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000086"></a>It would be very sad if this important and growing group of people were thwarted in performing this kind of public service because they were worried it would affect their entitlement to benefit. When this point was raised in Committee in the other place, the position of local authority councillors was made clear&#151;their position would be safeguarded under the Bill. But the position of service users was not addressed, although the Minister there said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07022052000099"></a>&#147;We do not&#151;and this is something that we can consider and reflect on in Parliament more generally&#151;have any plans at this moment, as a matter of policy, to extend the deductions to anyone other than councillors. However, it is important to have the power contained in this clause which would enable that to take place, if that became the Government&#146;s policy or any Government&#146;s policy in the future&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07022052000087"></a>I would be glad if the Minister could address this point when he replies. I beg to move.</p>

Refusal to respond positively to it could be self-defeating. All of us here know that charities save the public purse very considerable sums year by year in providing services that would otherwise have to be provided by public authorities; and in any way to inhibit people from helping them could be much costlier than conceding the amendment. This is not to say that cost is the only consideration. Knowing the value of policy initiatives is no less important than knowing their cost. I am sure that my noble friend Lord McKenzie will want to help if he can; if not now, then at a later stage of our consideration of the Bill.</p>

So it is not necessarily charities with which we are concerned here; it can be any public service of the state or charity or anything else. All other members of her advisory group receive one-off payments for this work but, as this one-off payment is higher than

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000003"></a>I accept that in many cases there will be a very fine line between work that is therapeutic and work that is done simply as a job. One of the case studies in the not-so-little red book mentioned a part-time job in a gift shop that would be allowed under the earnings rules for income-related ESA. A similar job possibly involving more hours a week could be very useful in helping a disabled person to gain confidence before returning to full-time work. That prompts me to ask how the Government intend to distinguish between regular work and therapeutic work, because it is hoped that both will eventually lead into full-time employment, which is what we are all after.</p>

<p><a name="07022064000004"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0002.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="07022064000085"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The amendment seeks to provide powers to disregard payments received and ensure that activity undertaken as part of service user involvement will not be taken into account in calculating benefit entitlement or payments.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000005"></a>The Government recognise the importance of encouraging public bodies to involve service users in improving services, and we are also aware of the concerns that have been raised about how current benefit rules can make it difficult to ensure service user involvement. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, gave us an example of that.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000006"></a>Employment and support allowance is an earnings replacement benefit, so we have to consider very carefully the effect on benefit entitlement of any activity which provides income. Equally, we have to take into account the effect of that activity on eligibility for benefit. However, it is equally important to remember that ESA is built on the aims of encouraging people to work, to build skills and to increase their confidence. It is essential that we provide an appropriate balance between encouraging participation in public life and protecting taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000007"></a>I know that it is argued by some that service user involvement is not work but I do not think that that is a helpful distinction to make. Service user involvement involves many of the skills and activities that people routinely engage in in their everyday employment and ensures that services reflect the needs of the people who use them. In creating any distinction, we would be dismissing the value of service user engagement in helping disabled people to build confidence and develop the skills that would help them into other types of work. As such, service user involvement could count as part of a person&#146;s work-related activity.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000008"></a>Everything that this new clause proposes in respect of treatment of service user engagement can already be done through the Bill. For example, the aim of the amendment could be achieved through the flexibility we already have in Clause 3 where we can regulate for the appropriate treatment of any payments regarding the contributory allowance, including the treatment of expenses.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000009"></a>However, whatever we do must be consistent with the principles underpinning the employment and support allowance. ESA is built on a foundation that people should be encouraged to work, build skills and

We want to encourage participation in public life as part of that, but we think that, as is already the case with councillors, a balance is to be drawn between income from working in and representing their community and avoiding duplicate provision from the public purse.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000010"></a>We want to ensure that people are rewarded properly and appropriately for their contribution and involvement in their communities, and that there is the right balance between benefits for people who are unable to work full-time due to illness or disability, and the income those people can earn. Any changes we make need to be approached with care. We need to understand what the effects would be, not only for service users and public bodies, but, more widely, for earnings rules and work incentives.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000011"></a>While service user involvement is an important activity, we also need to take account of the fact that our goal for many people with health conditions or disabilities is work, and we must not create disincentives for people to achieve that in our enthusiasm to ensure that all members of society can engage in activities in addition to employment.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000012"></a>We also need to make sure that the procedures and guidance properly deal with service user involvement. Some Members of the Committee will know that we have recently announced a change to the rules on expenses paid to volunteers to ensure that people who give up their time when on benefits are not penalised. Alongside that, we have revised the guidance on applying the incapacity-for-work test to emphasise that when people take part in service user involvement they should not automatically be sent for a reassessment. A reassessment should be done only when there are specific reasons for believing the work a customer is doing demonstrates that they no longer satisfy the conditions of entitlement to the benefit. We intend that similar guidance will apply to ESA in the future.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, made reference to therapeutic work. The permitted work rules replaced the old idea of therapeutic work, as agreed with the person advised that&#151;oh! I will leave that note to one side as I cannot read it. The question of permitted work rules is important, but in certain circumstances service users would fall outside the rules, but permitted work rules might be a route for some to engage in the manner envisaged.</p>

<p><a name="07022064000014"></a>I hope this reply reassures the Committee that the Government understand the issues the amendment intends to address, and that it is not necessary as the Bill already contains relevant powers. I should also like to reassure noble Lords that, as the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform said in another place, we are continuing to look for more flexible ways of helping people take up opportunities without fear of their benefits being removed. I therefore urge the noble Baroness and the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

First, how much money can you get, given that we are talking about an earnings replacement benefit? There is a clear read-across here to earnings disregard, income support and other benefits. That needs to be clarified. Secondly, the number of hours you are working may seem to indicate your capacity to enter the world of work rather than remain on a supporting benefit. The question there is about the reliability of the hours you can work, the fluctuating nature of your condition&#151;which is one of the big worries behind all this&#151;and whether the work itself will require consistency of hours. The third matter&#151;it has not been touched on but may also read across&#151;is the element of training involved, and therefore potential preparation. That comes up a great deal&#151;for example, whether people are able to go to, say, their local FE college and do a training course of some sort, and how many hours of training they may have before that too is regarded as interfering with their right to a dependency benefit.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000016"></a>Given that this is a very complicated area&#151;it is not just about work, because volunteering it is also about access to FE and related things&#151;will my noble friend assure us that there will be guidance or a leaflet? People will then know exactly where they stand and will not be afraid of jeopardising their benefit status by doing things that are of benefit to them, their families and society.</p>

Having listened carefully, the longer I listened to the Minister's reply, the more confused I got. If he is saying that we could achieve what the amendment of my noble friend Lady Thomas would achieve by doing things in another way, that does not answer the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. Are you going to do it or not? If we do not have an answer to that, it is not reasonable to ask my noble friend to withdraw her amendment.</p>

It seemed that what was being indicated was that there would be special rules for councillors. An explanation would be helpful for all of us. I am all for flexibility and lots of areas will be covered here, but are we certain that, in future, whatever exceptions are granted to councillors will also be granted to others in similar situations or to neither?

This area is not well understood and we should certainly do that.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000021"></a>The issue of training and the extent to which education features and lessens people's ability to be in full-time, part-time work or training is a complex one. We have an amendment on that coming up and I will deal with it more fully at that stage. At the moment, the specific provisions that effectively disregard the number of hours that councillors spend and reduce the contributory component by some of their allowances are specific provisions. We have no current policy intent to change that. But as I said, we are continuing to look at being more flexible in helping people to take the opportunities available. I am not sure that I can say more than that, but there is consideration of this matter.</p>

The power is clearly within the text of the Bill. The question is whether the Government will take advantage of using that. There are moments when ideas become apt, and the Government should take the opportunity to expand in a sensible way&#151;none of us is thinking of completely throwing open the doors and losing any kind of concept of therapeutic benefit. Still, there must be some idea within the department about what the cost would be of a fresh look, which, together with the sensible suggestion of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, could bring about some benefit. If it is introduced as part of this new cultural change&#151;make no mistake, that is what the Bill is&#151;it will be a missed opportunity. This issue, and this amendment, will come up later on in the Bill.</p>

It will be for the benefit of the Committee if he makesit clear exactly what he thinks he can do in future when considering the concept, rather than the fine print, of this important amendment moved by my noble friend. There are issues behind that which deserve fuller consideration in the further stages of the Bill.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000030"></a>The noble Lord said: The Minister and the rest of the Committee will be delighted to hear that I intend this amendment to be a quickie, compared with the first group of amendments that I had the pleasure of introducing. It is simple and, I hope, self-explanatory. I asked the same question at a meeting that the Minister graciously hosted with his civil servants when we were looking at the very early stages and preparing for Committee. I am hoping, though, to hear from the Government and have on record why those on the income-related strand of ESA are not allowed to take part in any educational training. It seems extraordinary that the Government would actively prevent these claimants pursuing an activity that would contribute much to their self-esteem and, ultimately, their employability.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000031"></a>This also raises questions of consistency. Since those on the contributory-based strand of ESA are able to undertake education, I am expecting that this will become a large proportion of their original work-related activity. After all, new skills allow a person unable to perform his traditional job, perhaps heavy labour, to find new employment in work more suited to his capabilities. I therefore look forward to hearing why the Government seem intent on denying these opportunities to those on the income-related strand. I beg to move.</p>

Clearly, we will return to this matter as we go through the Bill.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000033"></a>As the Disability Benefits Consortium points out, at the moment 16 to 18 year-olds can, while receiving incapacity benefit, attend up to 21 hours a week of education or training that would not be suitable for a person of the same age who did not have that disability. Like the consortium, we welcome this opportunity for the Government to state how they plan to identify students who may be able to benefit from &#147;disabled student&#148; rules under the ESA. We support the purpose of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07022064000034"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07022064000096"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The amendment would change the conditions of entitlement to the income-related allowance. It would remove the condition for a customer not to be receiving education in order for him to be entitled to income-related ESA.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000035"></a>I begin by assuring noble Lords that the condition of entitlement as we intend it to apply is not a blanket exclusion on all forms of education. Education and training certainly have a place within the framework of the employment and support allowance. For many of our ESA customers, some form of education or training may be the most appropriate work-related activity in helping them to move closer to the labour market, and that is precisely the outcome that we want.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000036"></a>However, we have an important duty to protect public funds, and one way that we must do that is by avoiding making double provision. Allowing recipients of the income-related allowance to participate freely in education would be an inappropriate use of public funds in cases where students already received appropriate funding through the education system. Income-related ESA will be aligned with other income-related benefits so that customers can study on a part-time basis without their benefit being affected.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000037"></a>We also make specific provision for certain groups of disabled students to access income support while they are studying, and we are bringing forward that access to benefit into income-related ESA. I think that that is the point on which the noble Lord sought assurance.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000038"></a>I appreciate the noble Lord&#146;s interest in the important issue of access to education for disabled people. That is entirely compatible with our commitment to improve the employment prospects of people who are some distance from the labour market. But we cannot make all forms of education, full-time and part-time, freely available to all customers of the income-related allowance, which is what the amendment would do. I suggest that that would be an inappropriate use of public funds, and I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

From what the Minister has just said, that does not mean all education; it means full-time education. Can we amend the Bill so that it reads &#147;full-time education&#148;?</p>

The broad principle that we are adopting here is to roll forward the current arrangements into the new system, but we also recognise that engagement in education would be expected to feature as part of the work-related activity. The construct allows us the flexibility to deal with those varying issues, which is why it is in that form. If we simply changed the wording to, say, &#147;full-time education&#148;, that would not necessarily fit all the circumstances that we are seeking to address.</p>

There is a real problem in defining full-time education. There are universities where the formal contact hours amount to only four or six hours a week but the home study associated with them can be anything from four to 40 hours. At the same time, the students may be working 10, 20 or 30 hours a week in order to finance their way through university. My noble friend is right that to put that in the Bill would not be helpful because it would be necessary to define &#147;full-time education&#148;, so it would merely postpone the definition. Guidance about what is training, education or part of a therapeutic work agenda and the advice of the advisers is a more appropriate way forward.</p>

That is my problem. Taking the noble Baroness&#146;s point, education taken for a limited number of hours&#151;part-time training, for example&#151;that does not receive government moneys through the Department for Education and Skills would certainly be appropriate. There should be a definition of what is allowed. It does not have to be in the Bill, but it ought to be in regulations. Clearly, a certain amount of education should and must be allowed.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000050"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 8, 11, 19, 22 and 25. As I and the noble Lords, Lord Addington and Lord Oakeshott, explained earlier, all today&#146;s amendments are probing amendments. I have tabled my amendments for the reason given earlier by the noble Lords, which is to explore the Government&#146;s thinking behind the low level of benefit given during the assessment phase.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000051"></a>We have already established that migrating claimants from IB will not have to go through13 weeks of assessment on the low benefit rate because we have been given assurances that migrating to ESA will not reduce the income of those already claiming benefit. That is obviously sensible: a person moving from long-term higher level IB to the support group from ESA would be justified in objecting to a significant drop in benefit for that amount of time.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000052"></a>Given the justification for maintaining the benefit level for migrants over the assessment phase and the current practice of backdating incapacity benefit to the date of claim, can the Government tell us what has prompted this innovation? I cannot think of any reason except to save money. This cost-cutting measure could cause significant hardship to those whose disability leads to costs that non-disabled unemployed claimants do not have to meet. The current system allows any debts caused by the discrepancy between the benefit received while being assessed and the costs of living to be met with the backdated funds once the claim is successful.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000053"></a>My reading of case study 1 in the Explanatory Notes on the regulations is that people will be able to apply for ESA while they are still being paid statutory sick pay. Can the Minister confirm that that is correct? That would go some considerable way to ensuring that disabled people did not have to undergo such a considerable period of restricted benefit. The income from their sick pay would then support them until the support or work-related component kicked in to provide a supplement to the basic allowance. Also, given that SSP lasts for six months, is there any bar on that benefit and ESA both being in payment other than, naturally, the usual total income rules?</p>
<h5><a name="07022064000082"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000054"></a>I also probe why the Government have decided that 13 weeks should be both the minimum and maximum period of assessment. What exactly is magic about13 weeks? How was that period chosen? I accept that time is taken in assessing the individual and, originally, in putting the claim through the system, but the fact remains that in many quarters 13 weeks looks like an awfully long time. Having said that, a guaranteed date to which benefit is back-dated once the assessment is complete is only sensible. However, a minimum length will give rise to the extraordinary situation of completed assessments being embargoed.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000055"></a>Do the Government intend to keep claimants in suspense for the whole 13 weeks? I certainly hope not as I am advised that with mentally ill people suspense  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC22"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can lead to stress, then depression&#151;a vicious downward spiral that we should all hope to avoid or, at the very least, keep to a minimum. But perhaps the Government intend that those whose claims have been rejected will move on to JSA, with its accompanying support, as soon as it becomes clear that they will not be eligible for ESA. The Government have already conceded that with many assessments the conclusion will be only too evident. They have explained that those who are too ill or disabled to undergo a face-to-face interview will be moved to the support group on the basis of paper evidence&#151;for example, from their doctor. Are the Government really planning to say that, although they understand that someone is unable to undergo an interview, he must still wait a full 13 weeks before collecting his benefit?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000056"></a>I am sure that the Minister will be quick to reassure me that many of these concerns are the result of a misunderstanding of the Government&#146;s intentions&#151;a favourite word that he used in responding to me and to us all the other day. I look forward to his clarification. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07022064000057"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0003.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="07022064000105"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 6, 9, 12, 23 and 26 in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Addington, and to the other amendments in this group.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000058"></a>I am not sure that our amendments are probing amendments. I hope that I am wrong, but it was noticeable at Second Reading that when we asked whether people would lose out and not have their claims backdated as they do at present, the silence from the Minister was deafening. I hope that I am wrong and that he can clarify that. However, these amendments would ensure that there is no such delay and that people&#146;s assessments are backdated to the date of their claim if their assessment is successful.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000059"></a>These are all linked amendments with a single purpose. Again, the Disability Benefits Consortium sums it up well in saying that claimants of ESA will get the full rate after the end of the 13-week assessment period and will not get backdated payments. The consortium believes that making people wait on a low level of benefit for 13 weeks with no backdating could create severe and ongoing hardship among many people, especially those coming off sick pay. It sees no reason why it should not be possible to backdate the appropriate rate of ESA to the point of claim, as is currently possible with IB. I think that those points are very fair.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000060"></a>With regard to the effect on young people, the Child Poverty Action Group made very similar points. It said that the Government accepted in their Green Paper consultation report that it was not their intention to penalise young people by aligning the basic rates of main phase ESA with JSA rates. However, according to the CPAG, the Government still propose to penalise young people during the assessment phase by paying the holding benefit at a rate in line with JSA, which will leave some sick and disabled people with inadequate incomes for three months simply because of their age.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000061"></a>If an assessment is completed before the end of the 13-week assessment phase, it is unfair that people should be worse off than they are now. The full

In addition, why should vulnerable people suffer because of where they live and whether the level of efficiency in the assessment process varies? I hope that these are probing amendments but they may well not be.</p>

They would affect our ability to set the level of the components which form part of the amount of ESA in the main phase. I believe that some of them may be intended to seek an assurance about a maximum period between customers submitting their claim and their entry into the assessment phase, including receiving payment of their benefit.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70220-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="70220-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000063"></a>The amendments would effectively remove the assessment phase from ESA. The assessment phase is key to the structure of the new benefit because we want to avoid making any assumptions about people before there has been an opportunity to carry out the necessary assessments. We also believe that it is right for the assessment phase to be fixed at a standard length. It would be unfair for some people to move on to the higher rate of benefit earlier than others due to circumstances such as delays in acquiring appropriate medical evidence that are beyond any customer&#146;s control. In fact, an assessment phase of 13 weeks means that most customers will move on to the higher, main phase rate of benefit sooner than they would see an increase in their benefit under the current system.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000064"></a>The amendments, which I understand may or may not be probing, would also remove very important powers. By removing Clauses 2(4)(c) and 4(6)(c), the powers to set the level of the work-related activity component and the support component would be taken out of the Bill. That would render entitlement to the components meaningless, since no amount of additional benefit would be attached to them.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000065"></a>The purpose of proposed paragraph (e) of Amendments Nos. 12 and 26 is not entirely clear. I believe that it may be intended to seek an assurance about the maximum period between customers submitting their claim and their entry into the assessment phase, including receiving payment of their benefit. It may help if I explain how a claim is made.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000066"></a>When someone submits a claim for benefit, their date of claim is then established. For ESA, we intend to maintain the alignment recently drawn between IB and IS so that when Jobcentre Plus is notified of an intention to claim&#151;for example, through a telephone call to the contact centre&#151;that date can be treated as the date of the claim if the properly completed claim form is then received within one month.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000067"></a>Entitlement to ESA will be dependent on the customer having made a claim for it. Once a claim is made, the first day of entitlement is established, and the assessment phase will start at that first day of entitlement. The relationship between that date and the date a claim is made can vary&#151;for example, because customers can backdate their claim by up to three months. It should also be noted that three waiting days will be served before there is any entitlement to receive ESA after making a claim in a period of limited capability for work.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07022064000068"></a>Let us use the example of a customer contacting Jobcentre Plus on 8 February to make a claim for ESA. When he sends in his completed claim form on 11 February&#151;within one month of the original date&#151;his date of claim is confirmed as 8 February because it was the date of first contact with Jobcentre Plus. However, this customer has been sick since3 January, so he wants his entitlement to benefit to be backdated to cover the whole period he has been sick. No entitlement to benefit arises on the first three days of limited capability for work&#151;the waiting days&#151;so his entitlement and his assessment phase start on6 January. This means that he will receive a backdated lump sum for the period since 6 January and he will then be paid as normal. His assessment phase will end on 7 April&#151;13 weeks after 6 January. If his PCA is completed by 7 April and he is assessed as having limited capability for work, he will move on to the main phase and receive the appropriate component. If, however, his PCA takes until 21 April&#151;for example, because he was too ill to attend the first scheduled medical examination&#151;he will stay on the assessment phase rate of benefit until 21 April but then have his main phase rate of benefit backdated until 8 April when the PCA has been satisfied.</p>

<p><a name="07022064000070"></a>A number of specific questions were raised, especially about SSP and claims for ESA. Customers can make an advance claim ahead of their SSP ending.

<p><a name="07022064000073"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, suggestedthat we might leave people in suspense for a whole13 weeks. We will tell people as soon as we can whether or not they have satisfied the PCA. However, they will not move on to the main phase of the benefit until the 13-week period is complete. As I said,that would be unfair. We originally estimated that13 weeks would be the period in which the majority or a significant number of claims could be satisfactorily dealt with.</p>

What is magic about the number 13? That is a very good question. Was it tested in the Pathways to Work pilots in those ambitious periods when personal advisers had to work with incoming and outgoing data? Did those pilots suggest that these were things that could be measured, not only in the specially chosen pilot areas but in downtown Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and so on? These are very important questions.</p>

The noble Lord asks what happens if that is not achieved and the claim is not dealt with and evaluated until after the end of that 13-week period. There will be a backdating of the work-related activity component or the support-group component to the beginning of the 14th week. Clearly, we need to ensure that the systems are efficient and that they deliver within the desired timeframe.</p>

Unless we can have an answer now, I am afraid that these amendments will not remain probing. It sounded ominous when he said that there would be resource implications if backdating into the assessment phase was pursued. It sounded as though they are trying to save money and as though people will have to wait longer than they do at the moment to go on to the higher rate of benefit by waiting through an assessment period that is not fully backdated. If I am wrong, can he say so? Despite making the points pretty clearly and giving the views of the Disability Benefits Consortium and the CPAG, I do not believe that I got a straight answer.

It is self-evident that, if you pay work-related activity components or support-group components that are on top of the basic level earlier, other things being equal in aggregate, that is bound to cost more than if you do not.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000004"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07022076000111"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> The question we are asking is: will it be earlier or later than now?</p>

I have already said that, if you look at the 13-week period and the time at which the work-related activity component or the support-group component kicks in&#151;and we have emphasised that the former of those would be higher than the existing long-term rate of IB&#151;you would expect that would arise earlier than under current circumstances. Obviously, the assessment phase has a different effect. That comes from an analysis of those timeframes and the components of payments within those timeframes.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000006"></a>I stress again that we have not set the overall level, but we are saying that it would be higher than the existing long-term rate of IB. You have to look at the new arrangement; you cannot simply compare it readily with the old. Also, when you look at the ESA, you are not only looking at the benefit levels; the support package that comes with it is a key part of it. That is why it is structured as it is. In terms of where you draw the line, clearly a judgment must be made and a balance must be struck between the needs of all the customers or clients&#151;call them what you will&#151;who are the people that we should be looking to support and help.</p>

They are likely to have considerable costs attached to their disabilities. Have the Government considered the impact on that particular group of having to wait for 13 weeks before they get the benefit to which they will subsequently be deemed entitled?</p>

I stress that people in the support group will be getting a higher component than those who are just in receipt of the work-related activity component. A greater benefit will flow at the week-14 point.</p>

She was saying that, unless the benefit is backdated, the individual concerned will have to live in some way, with all the associated costs of disability, during that 13-week period. With respect, I do not think that the Minister has answered her point.</p>

As I understand it, this means that claimants have to wait until the beginning of week 14 before they receive the benefit which has been assessed as being due to them.

I stress again that we must look at the generality&#151;the totality&#151;of the package. Paying the enhanced components&#151;the work-related activity component or the support-group component&#151;from an earlier date for some but not for others, based purely upon efficiency of resources in any region, would not be particularly fair either.

It is probably fairly easy to see why they have been grouped together&#151;they say exactly the same thing. They ask to &#147;leave out paragraph (c)&#148; twice in Clause 2 and twice in Clause 4. Paragraph (c) is always the same. It states,</p>

To give me an answer, the Minister really has to tell me something along the lines of &#147;X number of regulations will be presented in X way. We will know exactly when they will occur; we will have a reference to them&#148;. It would be much better to have such a provision in the Bill, whereas at the moment we just do not know what it means.</p>

My colleague Jim Murphy, the Minister of State in another place, went back in Committee through some of the history of the past 10 to 15 years pointing out what had changed over that period. That is the environment in which the ESA will operate in the future. We need to have the flexibility to deal with that. Failure to respond to such changes could result in entitlementto the ESA components for customers for whom the benefit was not originally designed.

<p><a name="07022076000039"></a>I should like to hear the Government&#146;s intentions on a related matter. Some concern has been raised over how broad the PCAs of migrating claimants will be. If a claimant who is already claiming IB for a physical disability has migrated, will he be assessed for both mental and physical disabilities or just for the physical disability that he is already known to have? It is possible that someone on long-term IB for a physical disability could have developed a mental disability that had never been identified. It would seem sensible to assess everyone fully whether they migrate or make a new claim, especially as the new assessment has significantly different criteria from the old one. I beg to move.</p>

The Minister made a very welcome announcement at Second Reading that the mental health assessment and physical assessment scores would be combined. As the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said, it is essential that the commitment is spelt out in the Bill rather than being left to regulations.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000041"></a>I shall leave my other comments on the PCA until our Amendment No. 38 is reached about the physical descriptors, unless somebody brings them into our discussions earlier. I will wait until then to talk about descriptors in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000042"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07022076000132"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I know that noble Lords and the disability lobby are keen to ensure that we consider both physical and mental health conditions when deciding whether a customer has limited capability either for work or for work-related activity. I hope that during the passage of the Bill to date we have emphasised the importance of both kinds of conditions. Indeed, a key reason for the review of the PCA was to ensure that mental health conditions received the same weight as physical conditions, remedying an imbalance in the existing PCA.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000043"></a>I will look at the assessment for limited capability for work first; it is dealt with in Clause 8. During the earlier passage of the Bill there was considerable interest from the lobby on whether we would be combining scores for physical and mental health as part of the assessment of limited capability for work. As the Committee will remember, I announced at Second Reading that having considered this matter further and listened to the arguments put forward by stakeholders, we will allow the point scores for mental health and physical descriptors to be added together. That has been reflected in Regulation 3(3) of the draft regulations for Clause 8, which have been shared with noble Lords. I am very keen to emphasise that point today and to make sure that it is very firmly on the record, if it is not already.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000044"></a>The findings of the PCA review on combining scores were inconclusive. One of the findings is that there is no robust evidence base for assuming that a combination of mental and physical functional limitations causes greater disablement of a person in such a way that we should combine and increase physical and mental scores to allow that person to meet the benefit entitlement threshold. It also found that there were differences of opinion on this matter between the experts involved in the review. Given that we currently combine physical and mental health scores when assessing whether someone is entitled to incapacity benefit, we have decided that we would need more evidence to support any decision to change this approach for ESA.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000045"></a>The amendments proposed by the noble Lord are unnecessary. The use of &#147;or&#148; rather than &#147;and/or&#148; does not limit us to considering these conditions separately, allowing us to combine scores should we wish to do so; and, as I said, the draft regulations under Clause 8 provide for the combining of scores. We do not need to change the wording for that to be enshrined in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000046"></a>I will now turn to the assessment for limited capability for work-related activity, dealt with in Clause 9. Although the Clause 8 and 9 assessments are similar in name and are carried out at the same time, they are concerned with different concepts. The former assesses whether a person has limited capability for work, and therefore whether he is  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>eligible for the benefit; and the latter, whether it is reasonable to require him to take part in work-related activity, and therefore whether he is suitable for inclusion in the support group.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000047"></a>The two assessments are carried out in different ways. A person demonstrates limited capability for work if he scores 15 points or more in the test of limited capability for work. As I said earlier, that could include a combination of scores from physical or mental descriptors or both. But there is no direct correlation between a person scoring 15 points or more in the test for limited capability for work and that person being an appropriate candidate for membership of the support group. Limited capability for work-related activity is assessed in an entirely different manner&#151;by the customer satisfying one of 46 functional descriptors found in the schedule to the draft regulations under Clause 9. The levels of functional limitation used in these descriptors, which again relate to either physical or mental functioning, are much higher than many of the descriptors used in the test of limited capability for work under Clause 8. That is because only people who are so severely impaired that it would be unreasonable to require them to undertake work-related activity will be placed in the support group.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000048"></a>Only one of the 46 descriptors needs to be met to qualify for entitlement to the support group. This descriptor could relate to either physical or mental functioning. Where customers meet a combination of both mental health and physical descriptors under the Clause 9 test they will of course still be determined as having limited capability for work-related activity, but as there is no point-scoring system in Clause 9, the notion of combining scores of any type&#151;physical, mental or both&#151;is not required in the assessment of limited capability for work-related activity. However, we will of course look at the effects of physicaland mental functional limitations when deciding whether somebody meets any of the support-group criteria.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000049"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, threw in a question about migration and the PCA. People who migrate will be fully assessed by the revised PCA at their first review after migration. I hope that that clarifies that point and that I have reassured noble Lords about our intentions. I believe that these amendments are unnecessary and I therefore urge that they should not be pressed.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000050"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07022076000133"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I am grateful for that. I see on pages 39 to 42 of what I referred to earlier as the little red book that the Government of the day can add the descriptors together to come to a final result, as the Minister said on Second Reading. However, in parliamentary terms regulations can be altered almost at the stroke of a pen whereas primary legislation takes a lot longer to achieve, even if one can persuade one&#146;s own Government to find the time. Relying on regulations does not seem particularly satisfactory. As usual, I shall ponder what the Minister has said, but I most certainly reserve the right to come back to this on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000053"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment stands in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, who is unfortunately not able to be here. It was inspired by Macmillan Cancer Support and addresses a series of deeply held concerns about people with cancer whose treatments make them incredibly ill, or even just feel bad, over fluctuating periods. The Minister in another place, Jim Murphy, said that he would not expect people in this condition to be considered to be available for work. It is only sensible that there is some form of guidance about people who are undergoing treatment.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000054"></a>The matters raised here go far further than just cancer patients. This could apply to many other conditions that are treated over a period of time. A database will have to be compiled at some point involving interaction with the health service or expert charities to let you know exactly who will not be able to take part because they are undergoing certain forms of treatment. If the Minister could give us some indication of how that best practice of preparing such a database is going, I would be very grateful. Perhaps the process has already started. Not only cancer patients, but potentially others will be affected. I would be much happier if this could be brought forward to give us some idea of what is happening. The initial group may be cancer sufferers, but the situation will apply to many more people. With advances in medical practice, we hope that others will be able to receive treatment that, although perhaps not necessarily disabling in the short term, will certainly have side effects. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an insight into the thinking on how they will provide for information to be stored and distilled through the people who are effectively on the coal face doing this interviewing. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000055"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07022076000135"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Amendment No. 48, which has been tabled in my name, is in this group. In speaking to it, I shall speak also to the amendment tabled in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, which was so successfully moved by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, in her unavoidable absence. I spoke to her yesterday, and I regret to say that it looks as though she will not be returning to us for at least a month. We will miss her expertise in this area.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000056"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said, the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment was suggested by Macmillan Cancer Support; my amendment was also suggested by that organisation. The amendments aim to improve provisions to ensure that claimants are placed in the correct group. Macmillan Cancer Support is particularly concerned about which cancer treatments will be considered sufficiently debilitating to warrant being moved to the support group. As the noble Lord said, it is not just cancer patients who may find themselves in this position. There are other diseases and ailments that have just such invasive treatments. I note that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has introduced a Bill on  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>palliative care that covers a wider group of disabilities than just cancer. Although we all welcome the Government&#146;s proposals that terminally ill patients and those undergoing certain invasive forms of chemotherapy will not be subject to conditionality, Macmillan is concerned that the assurances are not wide enough. In particular, radiotherapy and non-invasive forms of chemotherapy can be just as debilitating and can result in a patient being unable to undertake work-related activity. There can be added complications, such as a high risk of infection. Given the difficulty of predicting the side effects of many of these treatments or of anticipating the disabling fatigue that many patients suffer, can the Government assure us that they will consider including people undergoing active-type cancer treatment as well as terminally ill patients in the support group?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000057"></a>My amendment was designed to raise many of the same points. In particular, I would like to clarify a few points about the frequency of the PCAs. I understand that the time before the next PCA will be decided at the previous PCA. Is that correct? Can the Minister expand on how much flexibility the assessors will have in deciding how long it should be before the claimant is reassessed and what criteria they will use to select an appropriate length of time? Without a fair and transparent system of reassessment, claimants are in danger of being consigned to the support group without the encouragement and incentives of work-related activity from which they would benefit or of being subjected to needless and stressful PCAs at arbitrary intervals. There is a fine line to be drawn between those two possibilities, and I would be interested to hear where the Government intend to draw it.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000058"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07022076000136"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> I support the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. He knows that I have spoken about ME/CFS in the context of social security benefits for many years. The way that ME patients have been treated for many years is disgraceful. I cannot say anything less than that. ME groups have been negotiating new definitions for chronic fatigue syndrome and ME with the Department for Work and Pensions for some time, and they seem to have hit a brick wall as the DWP has arbitrarily withdrawn from any further negotiations. I believe I sent the Minister papers on this some time ago. The difficulty is that people who have severe ME are not being taken into account. When they have severe ME, they are bed-bound and need constant care. They are not lying in bed because they do not like work&#151;we have had this debate before&#151;but because they are seriously ill. I know that the DWP says that the illness may be progressive in some patients but is not life-threatening, but there have been a number of deaths from ME, including suicides and deaths from &#147;natural causes&#148;. It is life-threatening if it gets bad. If patients are made to undertake the treatment recommended, we know that there have been cases where there have been problems. I support the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, on Amendment No. 48. It is important that it is brought into effect.</p>

They relate to the experience garnered from the pilot Pathways to Work projects. How did the exercise of discretion work in these circumstances? Has any knowledge gained from how that discretion was used been brought to bear on the proposals going forward? It is important to know whether there is enough statistical data from which to make sensible predictions. In my experience, the case loads that personal advisers are dealing with lead them to conclude that everybody gets the same kind of treatment. Discretion takes extra time and involvement and the caseloads that the advisers are dealing with, even in the pilot projects, are stretching. That is bound to get worse as the programme unfolds across the rest of the country, and this is potentially a particular vulnerable group of claimants and clients that needs very special consideration.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000060"></a>Has anybody done any risk analysis or cost-benefit analysis of what it would cost to issue the blanket exemption that Macmillan is asking for? I do not think that it would add up to an amount that would make a significant strategic difference to the implementation of the proposals in the Bill. The Committee might like to have some sense of it. It might be difficult to pin it down to a specific sum of money, but the department must have a ballpark figure that would give it a sense of what it would cost to concede this amendment. If I am wrong about that and it is a strategically large number, the Committee would want to look at it again. The case that has been made to me is persuasive. Failing safe with this client group is the right thing to do, and I would need powerful evidence to suggest that the Government should do otherwise. I hope that the Minister will look carefully at this group of amendments and will go back to his advisers and ask them more questions, particularly about the cost and the capability of caseworkers who are handing a big case load to apply discretion in the case of this vulnerable client group before he can be satisfied that the clients will not suffer at the hands of this new system in an untoward way.</p>

While I am on the subject of the support group, I should take the opportunity to clarify a statement I made at Second Reading in response to a point raised about people undergoing cancer therapy. I said that there would be no automatic process on to the support group because we do not want to write anyone off, so the criteria for entitlement to the support group are based on the functional limitation that the individual has as a result of the condition. As the Committee knows from the draft regulations, we have made provision for a limited group of people, including those who are terminally ill and people undergoing parenteral chemotherapy for cancer, to be treated as having limited capability for work-related activity.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000062"></a>Amendment No. 14 is concerned with those undergoing treatment for cancer. An individual who is found to have limited capability for work-related  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>activity will be placed in the support group. People in this group will not have to participate in work-focused interviews or undertake work-related activity as a condition of receiving all of their employment and support allowance. The criteria for determining limited capability for work-related activity will not be based on specific health conditions or disabilities, but will focus on how severely these conditions impact on an individual&#146;s ability to function. We believe that this will be a fairer way, as conditions can affect different individuals in very different ways. It also means that we will look at what each individual can do and at what it is reasonable to require him to do. These criteria will be detailed in regulations under Clause 9, and the Committee has seen draft copies.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000063"></a>However, we do accept that there are circumstances where it would be sensible to allow entry to the support group even if the individual does not have limited capability for work-related activity. Paragraph 9(a) of Schedule 2 allows us to make provision in regulations to treat certain groups of people as automatically having limited capability for work-related activity. Our draft regulations include provision for people who are terminally ill and for those who are undergoing certain forms of chemotherapy that we know to have disabling side effects in all people receiving them. It would clearly be unreasonable to require people to take part in work-related activity in the final few months of their lives. Equally, it would be wrong to require people undergoing treatment which in and of itself is likely to cause severely debilitating effects on all people undergoing it, to do so.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000064"></a>This does not mean that people receiving other forms of treatment will not be placed in the support group. We recognise that other forms of treatment can be equally disabling for many customers, although not necessarily for all of them. That is why we will consider each individual&#146;s circumstances and the way in which his treatment is affecting his functional ability when looking at whether he meets one of the descriptors in the schedule to the regulations under Clause 9 in order to determine whether he should be placed in the support group.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000065"></a>Regulation 3(2)(c) of the draft regulations also makes provision to treat people as having limited capability for work-related activity if engaging in such activity would pose a substantial risk to their physical or mental health, even if they do not meet any of the descriptors. We will consider this factor on the basis of the circumstances of each individual and because we want to treat each person as an individual there will be additional flexibility for personal advisersto defer interviews where appropriate. The draft regulations set out that an interview can be deferred where it would not be of assistance to the customer or appropriate in the circumstances. This is likely to be the case where someone is undertaking treatment for cancer.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000066"></a>I am also aware of the concern that has been voiced about people whose condition fluctuates in severity over time, and I know that there are concerns about whether the current or revised PCAs will accurately assess the overall capability of such people. It is important to take account of a person&#146;s condition over a period  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of time, not just on the day of the assessment, otherwise we would not have a full and clear picture of the person&#146;s functional abilities and limitations. I assure the Committee that the PCA is not a snapshot of a customer&#146;s condition on the day of the assessment. It already takes into account the effects of a person&#146;s condition over a period of time when assessing whether he is able to carry out any of the activities set down in regulations. Using their medical skills and knowledge of the course of illnesses or disabling conditions, healthcare professionals carrying out the PCA will consider how the person has been during past periods, how he is on the day of the assessment and how he is likely to be in future periods. So in assessing a person&#146;s entitlement to the support component, the healthcare professional will take account of whether a customer satisfies any one of the criteria, bearing in mind the customer&#146;s condition not just on the day of assessment, but how he is likely to be affected over a period of time. It is therefore unnecessary to include a new clause making provision for reassessment of whether a customer has limited capability for work-related activity.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000067"></a>As I have mentioned, we have also taken powers in the Bill allowing us to defer conditionality for a customer where it is appropriate to do so. We intend to use them to deal with circumstances in which a work-focused interview would not be appropriate at a given time. We anticipate that this will be used where there are short-term fluctuations in a customer&#146;s condition.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about the cost of the amendment. This is an issue not of cost but of principle. The noble Lord smiles, but the purpose is to try and deal with individuals, to understand the limitations that their disability and health condition have on them, and help them through it into work-related activity. If we add blanket exemptions into the support group, we are at risk of repeating the mistakes of the past. We must ensure that the system is resourced so that those involved can take the time to ensure that the discretion in the regulations can be properly applied.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000069"></a>The noble Countess, Lady Mar, again raised the issue of those suffering from ME. I think that I have dealt with that to a certain extent, but it is an important issue. People with any condition will be assessed on its effect, not on the condition itself. That is an important point that we must make.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000070"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0005.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07022076000139"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> The problem with ME is that people can suddenly be tipped from being mildly or moderately affected into being severely affected. That is where my concern lies: people who suddenly become severely affected can be left out of the system, or treated badly.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000073"></a>Reverting to the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, on whether people have the time to look at individual cases promptly, we visited the Pathways to Work programme at Basildon a couple of weeks ago. We saw some data on how they had been dealing with the situation. Some of the condition management arrangements were truly impressive, specifically tailored to the individuals and moving them closer to the workplace in a profound way. I certainly encourage anybody who has not had the chance to engage with these opportunities to do so, so that they can see the impact upon people up close.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000074"></a>I have perhaps not dealt sufficiently with the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, on the availability of data and how best practice is to be shared. There is probably no quick answer to all of that. It is like any situation in which services are being delivered: you need to ensure that there are processes in place to share expertise and best practice. We will be coming on to the contractors later in Committee, and how they will ensure that best practice is used and properly shared. However, it is quite a wide issue, and that answer is probably inadequate for the moment. Perhaps we might seek to address that in more detail at a later stage. Accordingly, I hope that the noble Lord will consider withdrawing the amendment.</p>

I am sure that he meant no discourtesy, but he was very cavalier in the way he dismissed what I thought were perfectly reasonable questions about cost. In debates on previous amendments on the assessment phase, the Minister was quite happy to talk about resource issues. To some extent, where the dividing line is drawn is not a great issue of principle; it is a bit of a trade-off, and while I do not expect him to have the figures at his fingertips, I would have thought it perfectly reasonable to ask him to write to my noble friend Lord Kirkwood with some indication of cost.</p>

I will be delighted if the roll-out of the programme eventually gets every position across the country into the same position as Basildon in terms of the case loading.

On costings, it will come as no surprise if I restate the truth. The rate of allowance has not been set, and until it is, it is impossible to provide the sort of costings the noble Lord seeks. I revert to the genuine principle here: we are not looking to consign people to a support group when they do not need to be in that group. We want to engage with people in the widest possible way so that we can help and support them. It seems quite wrong to put everyone who is undergoing treatment for cancer in that support group. We have probably all had family circumstances which have been impacted by that dreadful challenge, but it affects different people in different ways. It does not inhibit some&#151;indeed, quite a lot&#151;of people who are undergoing the various stages of treatment from being involved in work-related activity, even if they are not in work itself.</p>

However, that is by the by.</p>

<p><a name="07022076000080"></a>My main point is about trying to ensure best practice.

If he could give me an idea of the ongoing process of how it is being done, such as the database and the contacts that will be needed in this and other fields, that would be very helpful.

<p><a name="07022076000085"></a>The noble Lord said: We have established over many years that once an amendment is on the Marshalled List it can be moved by any noble Lord, unlike a Starred Question, which has to be moved with the approval of the person who originally tabled it. On that basis, I will move the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, and speak also to my amendment. They are almost identical in effect, despite being targeted at different parts of the Bill. They are both designed to shorten the assessment phase in the case of terminal illnesses so that the full benefit might be enjoyed sooner. Sooner is the point, because listening to the discussion on the last group of amendments prompted me to think that it is one thing for terminally ill people to be put automatically on a support group, as the Minister says, but it is quite another thing for them to be fast tracked on to the support group. The question remains at what point they will get on to the support group. I hope that the Minister might have an answer for that. Anyone who is terminally ill is in a very vulnerable situation, and so is their family. The situation should not be made worse by money worries. They should not be made to wait for their benefits once it has been decided that they are in the position that these amendments describe.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000086"></a>The Government have given us welcome assurances on this matter in another place, and they have accepted that 13 weeks will represent a significant proportion of the amount of time left to a person suffering from a terminal illness. There might also be significant costs, as I have said, such as hospice care, which would not be covered by the reduced benefit available during the assessment period. I am interested to know exactly how the Government intend to help these claimants, if not by means of something similar to one of these amendments, by some other means. I beg to move.</p>

Ministers and officials have met MPs and Macmillan Cancer Support to discuss these issues in an effort to find the best way to support this group. Where people coming on to ESA have been diagnosed with a terminal illness and have a life expectancy of no longer than six months, we agree that it would be unfair to expect them to go through a three-month assessment phase before they receive the higher amount of benefit available in the main phase.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07022076000089"></a>That is why we have decided to fast-track terminally ill customers through the assessment phase, so that they can get the support that they need quickly and with the minimum fuss during what will be a hugely stressful time for them and for their loved ones.

We know how important it is for this group to receive the best service that we can offer, and we know that this decision will be welcomed both here and in another place. We thank all our parliamentary colleagues and other organisations who have contributed to the debate on this issue. We continue to work on the details of the policy.

I am delighted that there will be backdating to the beginning of the entitlement phase, which I think were the Minister&#146;s words. That presumably does not mean the date of the claim.

<p><a name="07022081000012"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 89. My noble friend and I tabled these amendments to probe the Government&#146;s policy on how claimants will move off the ESA when finding work, because that is clearly the ulterior motive of the whole operation that we are considering. I understand that the &#163;40 a week return-to-work grant is very helpful for those adapting to employment after a long absence. It has been mentioned to us that the end of that grant after one year can come as quite a shock. A beneficiary will by then have settled into employment to a considerable extent, and might&#151;indeed, we hope, will&#151;be earning a higher level of wage to compensate. Those higher earnings, however, could then start counting against other benefits, which the return-to-work grant does not. Do the Government have any ideas about how to soften that shock, perhaps by introducing a taper at the end?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000013"></a>Another piece of information that we have not yet acquired is the disregard level that is to be set for those earnings. What are the Government&#146;s intentions here? How high will they set the disregard for this new benefit? Do they have any intention to change the 16-hour rule&#151;we had a little discussion on that point earlier, but I did not get what I would regard as a full answer&#151;so that claimants can work a part-time job and yet still have access to support, albeit with some sort of claw-back if appropriate with the ESA? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000014"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0006.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="07022081000169"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The income-related employment support allowance replaces income support for people with an incapacity or disability. It takes account of a customer&#146;s and their partner&#146;s income and capital in determining the amount of benefit payable. It is not just payable to those with no income, but to those with a small amount of income that needs to be below their applicable amount. Not all income affects benefit entitlement, and some income, including earnings, may be disregarded in full or in part. For example, in the case of income support, disability living allowance is entirely disregarded, whereas earnings in excess of &#163;20 per week reduce entitlement for people who are entitled to the disability premium.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000015"></a>The Government regularly review the level of the earnings disregard in the benefits system, taking into account a large range of relevant factors, one of which is the prevailing labour market conditions. We also need to maintain a balance between ensuring that we do not undermine incentives for people to move off benefits into full-time work, allowing people to try out work to build self-esteem and confidence and to find out what is right for them. In addition, we need to maintain consistency across the benefits system to avoid complexity and help ensure better understanding of the rules by customers and staff alike.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000016"></a>Currently, people on income support who receive the disability premium are able to earn up to &#163;20 per week before their benefit is affected, but people in receipt of incapacity benefit, which has a quite different structure, are for a limited period able to earn up to &#163;86 a week provided they work fewer than 16 hours per week. That is commonly known as &#147;permitted work&#148;. The permitted work rules act as a

That is why in recent years we have extended the provision to enable more disabled people in receipt of IB to take advantage of the provision.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000017"></a>We recognise that the permitted work rules, which provide a gateway into the world of work and a balance between recognising the worth of work and a safeguard to protect the benefits system, are not as well understood as they could be and are seen as complex and inflexible&#151;we touched on that point earlier. One of the advantages of introducing a unified benefit is that it provides the opportunity to go back to the drawing board and to make improvements which build on the current system.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000018"></a>As we stated in the Green Paper, we want to make these rules even more effective for employment and support allowance, allowing people to try out work, build skills and confidence, and move towards greater independence. That is why we are continuing to look for more flexible ways of helping people take up opportunities and increase their options without fear of their benefits being removed straightaway. It is right that people should be given the opportunity to help themselves whenever they can. However, we also believe that people should not be allowed to claim benefits while working full time. There is an important balance to be struck, and this power will enable us to do so.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000019"></a>The noble Lord asked what plans there are for the &#163;40-a-week return to work grant and whether there are any plans for softening the end of the second year.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000020"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0006.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="07022081000170"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Earlier this afternoon, the Minister corrected me when I spoke about two years of the &#163;40-a-week payment; now he is talking about the second year. I am afraid that I am at a slight loss.</p>

Perhaps I should have said, &#147;any softening at the end of that one year into a second year&#148;. I think that that was the point the noble Lord was making; I apologise to him.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000022"></a>We have no additional plans for the return to work credit. Qualitative evaluation of RTWC pathways pilot areas found that people who expected the return to work credit to expire in the next few weeks were all thinking ahead to how they could manage the drop in income. Some had already taken steps to work longer hours; and some people had purposely not used the payment to help everyday budgeting, choosing to save it or to clear debts, and were not anticipating financial problems. Concern about the impending loss of RTWC was linked with believing themselves ineligible for working tax credit and with perceiving few alternative opportunities for enhancing income. People at least four months from the date of expiry said that they did not want to work longer hours. They thought that they could manage the loss of return to work credit by budgeting more carefully or perhaps investigate the possibility of receiving working tax credit. The evaluation showed that people can live and operate within the change and understand its parameters.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000023"></a>I hope that that has dealt fully with the noble Lord&#146;s points. I stress again that we are continuing to look at more flexible ways of helping people take up opportunities and increase options without fear of their benefits being removed straight away.

Some of the evidence from the pilot schemes suggests that it is difficult to capture progress if you are below the thresholds. If a client or customer&#151;whatever we call them now&#151;is acting in good faith, the adviser could recognise that good faith by giving them more flexibility than is currently in the plan. It might be difficult to tie down in terms of the regulations that would permit it. However, my experience is that if you can engage the interest of someone who is willing to try work, even at a very restricted level, such as a few hours a day or even a week, with the intention of building that up, and if the personal adviser thinks that that goes with the grain of what we are trying do in the Bill and the principle behind it, we should give the personal adviser the discretion to say, &#147;Let&#146;s give it a try for six months&#148;. That power is not explicitly in the Bill and we should think about including it.</p>

One could do it by discretion or by flexing the current rules, which can be an inhibitor. If we rolled forward the permitted work rules, people on a contributory allowance would be able to work for up to 16 hours a week and earn &#163;86. That is currently not the same for people who are in receipt of income support. Whether flexibility can be considered to address that issue would go a considerable way towards meeting the noble Lord&#146;s point. He makesa good point, as ever, about the importance of encouraging people into work, perhaps by small steps, until they can go back into full-time work.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000038"></a>My amendments in this group attempt to make some provision for those claimants who are on ESA, not because of their own limitations but because of the attitudes of some employers. This is unfortunately not an unlikely obstacle to employment, but is instead one of the major barriers to work that disabled people continue to face, despite the Disability Discrimination Act as amended.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70220-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000039"></a>The Cochrane review found that 58 per cent of people with schizophrenia can work with the proper support yet, according to the DWP&#146;s report, 75 per cent of employers believe that it would be difficult or impossible to employ someone with that disability. Why are the Government not taking the opportunity this Bill offers to address this? We are currently debating a new system specifically designed to help disabled people move towards employment. What is the point of the ESA if, after considerable effort, time and investment on the part of the claimants and the organisations involved, employers are still unwilling to employ disabled people through lack of information or support?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000040"></a>Our amendments therefore seek to ensure that the Bill addresses some of the supply-side problems disabled people can face. The first two amendments are to appreciate that a disabled person&#146;s ability to work can be limited because no employer will hire them, even if they are perfectly capable of doing the work and, indeed, want to do the work. Such discrimination, whether deliberate or unintentional, is common and no less an obstacle to work than the disability itself. Can the Minister tell me how many disabled people are employed in non-government business now compared with 1997? Despite the Disability Discrimination Act and its amendment that I just mentioned, can the Government claim any credit here? It is instructive to learn the record of the Minister&#146;s own department. In a recent Written Answer in another place I discovered that in 2005-06, 34 new disabled people were employed in the DWP but 500 left. Going back to the foundation of the DWP in 2002-03, the statistics are much the same.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000041"></a>To illustrate the problems of disabled people seeking employment, I refer to one of my correspondents who had a very bad experience in an inner-city area. He is a  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>highly intelligent man who had just completed a computer accountancy course, even though he had produced a computer program for one of his son&#146;s schools at which he was a parent governor. He applied to the city council for a job. This individual is partially sighted with a degenerative disease and has now reached the point where he walks with a white stick. When he turned up for the interview, for which he reckoned he was qualified&#151;and clearly the council officials reckoned he was qualified, on paper anyway&#151;he was told to go away because he was carrying a white stick. That is illustrative of the sort of problems that can, and, I am afraid, do occur, and should not. I have to confess that that happened before the recent amendment to the Disability Discrimination Act. If that Act is working properly, such a situation will never occur again. It could easily occur in the private sector, however, which is something one does not want to happen.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000042"></a>My other amendment is to encourage the Government to complete the policy that is set out in this Bill regarding making claimants ready for work by improving awareness among employers. There is much that could be done to educate them, not only in the capabilities and strengths of disabled people but in the support already available, such as the disability facilitation grant. Do the Government have any plans to improve awareness of that grant? What other means of support is currently offered to employers with disabled employees?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000043"></a>To form an effective policy for improving employer attitudes to disabled people would involve considerable input from the DTI, as well as from the Minister&#146;s department. What co-ordination is there currently between the two departments on this issue? After such a comprehensive review of the disability benefit system, it will be deeply disappointing if the hoped-for improvements for disabled people are not achieved due to lack of sufficient co-operation between the two departments. I hope that the noble Lord will assure me that that will not happen. Various ideas are floating around as to how that might be done but, before mentioning them, I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s response to what he would like to see done, and we will see if we can coalesce. I beg to move.</p>

<ul><a name="07022081000149"></a>&#147;capability for work may be improved by the taking of steps by the Secretary of State in relation to factors that limit his capability to work&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000045"></a>The DWP report 95 showed that 74 per cent of employers do not know about the existence of the access to work scheme. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was going to shoot my fox at that point&#151;but he did not, so I am very grateful. Access to work can help to pay for adaptations to premises and equipment, support workers and travel to work among other things. Is it any wonder that many employers do not want to employ disabled people if they think that they have to bear the burden of any such adaptations to their workplace to accommodate such employees? Knowing about the access to work scheme would address that problem.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000046"></a>The way in which the amendments would work is that claimants would be informed during the work-focused health-related assessment about the access to work scheme, which they could then relay to potential employers. How is the Minister&#146;s department planning to make the access to work scheme better known?</p>

<p><a name="07022081000047"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07022081000180"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> I want to add one small point arising from what the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said about the DWP&#146;s record in employing disabled people. I do not know whether the Minister heard the &#147;Today&#148; programme this morning, but it is a fairly widely known fact that disabled people have a very good attendance record and very low absenteeism. Given that the DWP has the worst record of absenteeism and sickness of any major Whitehall department, it would be well advised to employ more disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000048"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07022081000181"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> This group of amendments concerns employers and attitudes of employers and what the Government will provide to individuals to help them to return to and remain in work. I shall deal first with the amendments proposing that a person&#146;s limited capability for work or work-related activity should be based on the grounds to the grounds of his condition, as opposed to being limited by his condition.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000049"></a>These amendments are born out of concern that disabled people may find themselves suffering unfair discrimination by employers because they have a disability. While I agree that the attitude of many employers to people with disabilities&#151;particularly a mental health condition or learning disabilities&#151;is something that we need to change, I would point out that it is unlawful under the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act for employers to discriminate against disabled people in recruitment and employment. It is not appropriate for any assessment of capability for work in determining entitlement to ESA to take account of potential unlawful actions by employers.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000050"></a>The way we determine entitlement to benefit must be defined in a way that applies nationally and consistently, not in a way that is dependent on local conditions, such as the attitude of different prospective employers. In the revised PCA, we have a method for fairly and objectively assessing benefit entitlement on the basis of a person&#146;s functional limitations resulting from his physical or mental condition. It is an assessment that will be consistently applied throughout the country. Introducing societal factors, such as employer attitudes, into the assessment would mean we would have to consider factors that might vary locally, which would undermine this principle of consistency. It would mean entitlement to ESA would be dependent upon factors such as where a customer lived, instead of upon the individual&#146;s level of functional limitation.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000051"></a>The noble Lord has also tabled AmendmentNo. 84, which relates to Clause 18 to ensure that any pilots we run,</p>
<ul><a name="07022081000150"></a>&#147;encourage employers to recruit and retain&#148;</ul>



<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07022081000139"></a>individuals. The powers set out under Clause 18 are designed to ensure that any pilots have a clear purpose in mind, which is to allow people with the ability to return to work to realise their potential. We are determined to explore a broad range of avenues that might lead to better outcomes for employment and support allowance customers. By offering a tailored package of help and support, including such schemes as access to work, we help customers become job-ready.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000052"></a>Existing legislation, in particular the employment provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act, already requires employers not to discriminate against disabled people in recruitment and employment. Those provisions also require employers to make reasonable adjustments to overcome any substantial disadvantage a disabled person might face, compared to a non-disabled person. We are already working closely with employers and will continue to do so. For example, we have undertaken a series of campaigns to raise awareness and understanding of the DDA among employers, especially small and medium-sized employers, and to encourage them to fulfil their duties. Building on that, we want to raise awareness and promote the employers&#146; role in the recruitment of people leaving benefit.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000053"></a>At a local level, Jobcentre Plus is leading the way in securing the effective, voluntary engagement of employers. In the provider-led areas of Pathways, for example, we specifically ask during the bidding process for information about providers&#146; involvement or links with local employers and employment agencies and how they will meet local labour market conditions. However, we do not believe that it is appropriate or effective to increase the regulatory burden on employers.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000054"></a>Amendments Nos. 57 and 58 relate to Clause 10 and concern the work-focused health-related assessment. This is an additional stage that we are adding to the PCA process to focus on a customer&#146;s residual capacity and on what health interventions would help to increase it. At the work-focused health-related assessment, we will be exploring with customers the barriers that they perceive between themselves and the labour market. Some of the barriers will be medical, but it is likely that some of them will relate to other factors, such as a lack of appropriate skills or the need for workplace adaptations. We are not suggesting that those non-medical barriers will be ignored, but we want the work-focused health-related assessment to focus on what health-related interventions&#151;for example, a course of cognitive behaviour therapy&#151;might help to improve a customer&#146;s functional capability. We know that early intervention can have a beneficial effect on health and capability, so we want to ensure that any health-related barriers are identified and acted on as soon as possible. That is why the assessment will be carried out by trained healthcare professionals.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000055"></a>That is not to say that the assessment will not also deal with other matters, and we expect the healthcare professional carrying out the assessment to be able to identify, in general terms, occupational or other factors that are creating a barrier to work. Information from the work-focused health-related assessment will be

Although personal advisors are unlikely to have the skills needed to identify health-related interventions, they will be able to providehelp and support to address societal barriers, such as skills needs or low confidence, during work-focused interviews. It would not be the most effective use of scarce resources to expect healthcare professionals to provide customers with information which is available from other sources.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000056"></a>In relation to occupational factors, the first PCA, including the work-focused health-related assessment, will be carried out during or soon after the 13-week assessment phase. As I said, as well as identifying health-related interventions, the healthcare professional will be identifying other factors that are creating a barrier to return to work. They will consider workplace factors in general terms. For example, they will be able to advise whether a customer has mobility problems making it difficult to assess a workplace, or if a customer has difficulty standing for prolonged periods of time. At this early stage, however, without a specific job in mind for the customer, it is not yet appropriate to carry out a detailed workplace assessment.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000057"></a>Turning to some of the specific questions raised and the issue of the DWP and its record on this matter, we always need to do more. We need to be mindful that reporting on disabilities is self-reporting by employees and we need to understand the figures better. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, quoted some figures on joiners and leavers. I cannot comment without more detail, but I suspect the problem is partly to do with the recent restructuring of the department. Perhaps he will let me have the source of those figures so that I can look at them in more detail.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000058"></a>The noble Lord asked about co-operation between the DWP and the DTI on the matter of workingwith employers. There is wide cross-governmental co-operation in relation to the employer engagement agenda. The DWP, Jobcentre Plus, the Health and Safety Executive, the Department of Health, the NHS and the DTI are exploring together how they may best contribute, particularly in relation to issues affecting people with mental health problems.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000059"></a>I want to take a moment of the Committee&#146;s time to run through some of the things that the Government are doing on a cross-governmental basis to help people who have mental or physical disabilities into employment. We recognise that the problems faced by people with mental health conditions in particular are varied and complex, which is why the changes to the Disability Discrimination Act are important. We also recognise that there is no magic bullet and that one department alone will not be able to tackle these problems. In October last year, the Department of Health launched a new initiative called &#147;Action on Stigma: Promoting Mental Health&#148;, which was on ending discrimination at work. The scheme provides employers with a set of core principles that they should seek to follow and a clear process to help them do so, as well as information, advice and support via nine regional employment support teams. We also have the cross-cutting review that the Chancellor announced in Budget 2006 looking at mental health problems and employment outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000060"></a>Our strategy of engaging employers is advised by the Prime Minister&#146;s Strategy Unit report <I>Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People</I> and the National Employment Panel&#146;s <I>Able to Work</I> report. The clear message is that success will be best achieved through a sustained campaign led and delivered by employers, supported by the Government and in consultation with disabled people. We believe that committed employers should be given the opportunity to develop and spread positive ideas on an employer-to-employer basis.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000061"></a>If we look generally at the Government&#146;s record on supporting people with disabilities, we have strengthened civil rights and the Disability Discrimination Act has been strengthened to provide protection for an additional 600,000 disabled workers. We have brought 7 million more jobs and 1 million more employers within the scope of the employment provisions, and we have established the Disability Rights Commission. I have already mentioned the National Employment Panel and the <I>Able to Work</I> report.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000062"></a>The issue of training and awareness raising for employers is an important point. We actively promote the availability of all our disability services and programmes&#151;the noble Baroness asked about that&#151;including Access to Work among both disabled people and employers. Information on all of them is freely available in jobcentres and on the Jobcentre Plus website, as well as through disability organisations. Jobcentre Plus invests &#163;300,000 a year in marketing and publicising its disability services and programmes, including Access to Work. Leaflets and information about Access to Work are freely available in Jobcentres, and disability employment advisers regularly meet local employers to promote the full range of disability services, including Access to Work.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000063"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07022081000182"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> Why is Access to Work not well known? I take the point that it is well known in jobcentres and so forth and there are pages and pages about it on the DWP website, but it is not a well-known benefit. It is particularly important to find another way of getting the information to employers. Perhaps the DTI should be involved. Perhaps the CBI should take some steps. Will the Minister speak to colleagues in the DTI to see whether that could happen?</p>

<p><a name="07022081000064"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07022081000183"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The point is well made. The research on Access to Work shows that applications come from a range of sources, which suggests that there is a degree of knowledge out there. However, I accept generally in relation to Access to Work and the other issues that I ranged over, there is more to be done. This is a significant task. We must do this on cross-governmental basis and in partnership with employers and the support groups which work so valuably and importantly with disabled groups. That is the best way forward.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000065"></a>I hope that the Committee will find that helpful and that I have dealt with all the points that have been raised. If not, I am happy to have another go, but in the circumstances I will ask the noble Lord to consider withdrawing the amendment.</p>

But then he crossed through the barrier of the problems with employers. I agree with the noble Baroness that the publication and expansion of Access to Work would be a good way of getting round the particular problems that she and I have identified.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000067"></a>The extraordinary thing is that, as was discussedin Committee in the Commons, the drafting of Clauses 8 and 9 is completely at odds with the definition of disability that the Government have effectively adopted with their acceptance of the strategy unit's report, <I>Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People</I>. The report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07022081000146"></a>&#147;Disability is defined for this project as the disadvantage experienced by an individual as a result of barriers (attitudinal, physical, etc.) that impact on people with impairments and/or ill-health&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022081000140"></a>Does not the wording also run counter to the most progressive example of a legal definition of disability as given in the Canadian Employment EquityAct 1995? This provides that &#147;persons with disabilities&#148; means persons who have a long-term or recurring physical, mental, sensory, psychiatric or learning impairment and who,</p>
<ul><a name="07022081000151"></a>&#147;a) consider themselves to be disadvantaged in employment by reason of that impairment, or</ul><ul><a name="07022081000152"></a>b) believe that an employer or potential employer is likely to consider them to be disadvantaged in employment by reason of that impairment&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07022081000141"></a>such as the example I gave earlier of the inner city council. The definition continues:</p>
<ul><a name="07022081000153"></a>&#147;c) and includes persons whose functional limitations owing to their impairment have been accommodated in their current job or workplace&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07022081000142"></a>&#147;On the grounds of&#148; is a concept that is also found in European framework directive 2000/78 which establishes a general framework for equal treatment in employment.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000068"></a>The result of my thinking on this is that labour market disadvantage and limitation on the grounds of physical and mental functioning are two entirely different concepts. The arguments put forward by the Government for not adopting the concept of labour market disadvantage do not apply to the idea of limitation being on the grounds of physical and/or mental health functioning. I shall have to think deeply about where I shall go with the amendment on what we might call the supply side of the Bill. For the moment, I can do no more, unless the Minister is poised to intervene.</p>

The revised PCA, based on functional limitations, is an objective assessment that is consistently applied throughout the countries. Other factors will be assessed at later points in a claim, particularly as someone moves closer to work, but are not appropriate for the PCA itself.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000070"></a>I turn to why we use &#147;disablement&#148; when the Disability Discrimination Act defines disability using &#147;impairment&#148;. It defines disability as,</p>

<p><a name="07022081000071"></a>The World Health Organisation defines disability as the restriction of ability that results from impairment. At the heart of this&#151;whatever definition you use&#151;the process is about understanding how the condition that a person finds himself in affects his functional ability to work or not to work or to progress towards work. The assessment of how it impacts on individuals is the key to this process.</p>

The noble Lord is naturally concerned with the construction of the benefit and is looking at the whole thing from the perspective of who we call &#147;the client&#148;, and who I used to call &#147;the claimant&#148;. I understand that. None the less, there is nothing more mentally debilitating than being on the work assessed group and going to interview after interview for a job for which you know, and indeed your adviser knows, you are perfectly well qualified, and not getting the wretched thing. That will eventually push some people on to the supported group, which is the last thing any of us wants.</p>

I agree entirely with the thrust of the noble Lord&#146;s point. We seem to be arguing only about how the PCA fits in to how you deal with all that. Issues of discrimination generally are dealt with through a range of factors, including cross-government engagement. I outlined earlier some of the engagement that is taking place. It is a huge task&#151;I would not suggest otherwise&#151;but I believe that we are approaching it on a cross-government basis. The welfare to work reforms are a component of that, but it is not the only plank of how we deal with this discrimination, which is entirely unacceptable.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000079"></a>It is of course critical that assessors are sufficiently trained so that they can successfully assess the limitations a disability imposes. Unfortunately, even the research of the Department for Work and Pensions suggests that this is not the case, and that assessors are especially lacking in experience with mental disabilities and learning difficulties. Do the Government intend to raise the standards of training of their assessors? If not, will this not be a significant obstacle to the rollout of the ESA? It would be sensible, in view of many of the variations of disabilities, to ensure that a claimant with a mental disability is assessed by someone properly qualified in those types of disability. Do the Government have any intention of assigning different assessors to claimants with disabilities in their field of expertise, or will there be a totally random system of allocation? </p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000080"></a>Not only is there a strong argument for claimants with various disabilities to be assessed by assessors with appropriate and specific experience, but the two tests also seem to need a very different set of skills and training. Whereas the first assessor will need medical experience to understand fully the disability that they are measuring, the second will need considerable experience in rehabilitation and training to know what support options are available for the claimant and how much improvement can be expected from them&#151;in other words, how close they are to the job market. Can the Minister confirm that the two tests will be undertaken by two such different people?</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000081"></a>Where does the health professional approved by the Secretary of State, mentioned in AmendmentNo. 111, fit in? Is he to have direct contact with the claimant, or is he to advise the assessors or the decision-makers? Or, indeed, the decision-maker; I have not quite established whether there will be a single national decision-maker or whether they will be regional, or perhaps there will be one in each office. I do not know how these decision-makers will fit into the picture, but I am sure I shall be told sooner rather than later.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000082"></a>While I understand that the decision-maker, whoever he is and wherever he sits, makes the final decision, I cannot believe that he is expected to be a medical polymath without a full understanding of either employment needs or medical therapy. How can work-related interviews result in achievable and useful goals? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response for assurance on these points or an explanation of why my concerns are needless. I believe that this will be the first occasion on which the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin, has spoken from the Dispatch Box, and I congratulate her on her promotion. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000083"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07022081000190"></a>Lord Addington:</b> I must express a degree of envy. The noble Lord has put down an extremely good amendment that comes in straight alongside the issues with regard to good practice I was raising earlier. Unless you are qualified to carry out the assessment correctly, you cannot do it. It is that simple. Mental health is a subject that has been much on the minds of this House over the past few weeks, and we have seen that you need specific training.</p>




<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC54"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000084"></a>The noble Lord mentioned other types of disability. We can run down the list. Unless those involved have some expertise or training, or have at least been trained how to assess and bring in support&#151;which might be a way of squaring this circle, although even then there would be limitations&#151;they will not be able to do it.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000085"></a>Once again I apologise for not adding my name to this amendment&#151;I think our &#147;spring break&#148; has a little to answer for. Unless we get some form of assurance that we are getting people to carry out the assessment who know what they are talking about, the potential benefits of this system will start to miss a large proportion of its client base, or claimants&#151;call them what you will. The people who are going through these assessments may well not get the help they need, and the system will fail. Will the Minister assure us that assessors will be qualified to do this and qualified in bringing in the expertise when it is needed? That is what is required here. If that cannot be done, and if we cannot be given some idea of structures, there is a damn great hole in the whole system.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000086"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07022081000191"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> I welcome the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, on behalf of the rather large Liberal Democrat team. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, might have been feeling slightly lonely. We are delighted to welcome the noble Baroness and hope this will be the first of many ministerial appearances.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000087"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07022081000192"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> I do not want to be left out of this welcome. It is a great pleasure. This is my first Committee, so I know how the noble Baroness feels.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000088"></a>My question is not so much about qualifications and capability as quantity. We learnt from the pilots that we were dealing with people who were enthusiasts and converts; they were in key positions because they wanted to be. Some of the regions were chosen particularly because of the expertise among the existing staff. My concern is that in the very ambitious roll-out timetable for the programme of the Bill, the capacity of those capable of carrying these heavy responsibilities is not yet available. Earlier on, the Government accepted that this was a challenge. That word frightens me because Governments always struggle to deal adequately with challenges.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000089"></a>My noble friend is absolutely right. The whole business is hinged on getting appropriately qualified, sufficiently staffed positions. He is rightly concerned about the level of qualifications; I am concerned, more fundamentally, about the fact that the staff will not be there and they cannot be magicked out of thin air. This will take weeks, if not months, of intensive training; they have to have special people skills to be able to do the job. The noble Baroness may not have the answer immediately to hand, but how is the training process going? What capacity currently exists? Is the department confident that when day one arrives, there will be a sufficient number of people in place to start the process in a way that leaves her and her ministerial colleagues confident that the job can be done properly by an appropriate number of skilled individuals?</p>

Disability is exceedingly complex; when you are talking about mental health and bodily health&#151;a word I had not heard before, but I suppose I am included, having a disability&#151;it is vital to have properly trained staff, otherwise there will be a muddle.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000091"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07022081000194"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I feel well and truly welcomed to my position and to this Committee. I thank noble Lords for their warm welcome.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000092"></a>The assessment for limited capability for work and limited capability for work-related activity will take place during the same appointment and will be conducted by the same healthcare professional. As set out in the draft regulations under Clauses 8 and 9, where a claimant is asked to attend a medical examination, it will be with a healthcare professional approved by the Secretary of State. This means we will continue the current practice whereby all those carrying out medical examinations will undergo training specified and agreed by the department&#146;s chief medical adviser before being approved by the Secretary of State to carry out those examinations. With reference to the point made by the noble Countess, Lady Mar, one of the modules that the continuing professional development of health professionals covers is chronic fatigue syndrome.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000093"></a>The healthcare professional must subsequently maintain standards set by the Secretary of State to keep that approval. The training the healthcare professionals receive equips them to assess the functional effects of any disabling condition, either physical or mental. That is what is required to be able to assess limited capability for work or limited capability for work-related activity.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000094"></a>In addition, the healthcare professionals who carry out the assessment are also trained in the evaluation of written evidence so that they will be able accurately to identify those who will be in the support group on the basis of paper evidence. We do not intend that the training itself will be prescribed in regulations; this will allow us to maintain the necessary flexibility to change the requirements when required&#151;for example, to respond to feedback that a specific training need has been identified that applies to all healthcare professionals. We all recognise that that is very important.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000095"></a>Before the new PCA is introduced, we will develop new training for the Atos Origin healthcare professionals, who will carry out the revised assessment. So new training will be developed. We shall seek advice from appropriate organisations with a special interest in specific health conditions when we devise that training, which I think will be welcome. For example, the National Autistic Society has given valuable advice in devising training assessments, especially for people with Asperger&#146;s syndrome.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000096"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, made a point about whether the personal capability assessment for people with mental health conditions will be carried out by health professionals with expertise in that particular condition. The issue is very much about professionals being trained to assess functional capability.  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC56"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column GC56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>They are trained to understand mental health conditions, to have advanced interviewing skills and to assess customers&#146; issues with empathy. It may be appropriate in some situations to use healthcare professionals with specialist expertise&#151;for example, in assessing people with mental health conditions. But entitlement to benefit depends on the effect of a person&#146;s condition on his functional ability; it does not depend on detailed clinical knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of the conditions&#151;it is functional ability. All healthcare professionals are trained especially in assessing the functional effects of any disabling condition.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000097"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07022081000195"></a>Lord Addington:</b> If it is functional capacity that is being tested, what is the process by which that is assessed if you are not really an expert in the field? At which point are you told that you have to bring an expert in? When are you told that you do not understand something? It would be helpful to have that brought out. It would reassure me if there was a limitation whereby someone could say, &#147;I don&#146;t know what I am dealing with here and I need an expert brought in&#148;. Has that been addressed?</p>

<p><a name="07022081000098"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07022081000196"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> The point that we need to look at is on the personal capability assessment descriptors that are very detailed and which the staff are trained to apply. We need to be clear that in the past a particular diagnosis was used as a method of entitlement, whereas here we are talking about functional limitations as defined by the descriptors in the PCA test. The health professionals are trained to use those tests in a fair and consistent way. They are audited to ensure that they are applying their skills professionally and up to the standards required by the Secretary of State and monitored by the DWP&#146;s medical adviser.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000099"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked whether healthcare professionals carrying out the PCA receive training in assessing mental health. I think I have already mentioned that&#151;the answer is, yes. All healthcare professionals carrying out assessments are trained in the skills they need, including assessment in mental health problems. For ESA, the revised PCA mental function assessment is much more comprehensive than the current assessment, and we will provide training to all healthcare professionals in applying that revised test. We will consult organisations with a specialist interest in mental health when the training is being developed. We particularly recognise the value that such organisations can bring to developing this training. However, there is no need to be an expert in mental health to assess functional capabilities. We will be piloting the work-focused health-related assessment and will evaluate whether it will be more effective using the same healthcare professional or a different one, which is an important point. I hope that I have picked up all the questions. If I have not, I will follow them up.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000100"></a>The amendment makes provision in legislation for the training of healthcare professionals, but that would not improve or enhance the system already in place. Instead, the amendment would limit our

I therefore urge that the amendment be withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000101"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07022081000197"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I am very grateful to the noble Baroness. I have been labouring on these assessments under what appears to have been a misapprehension. As I understood it, there would first be an assessment using the descriptors to decide whether the process should be taken further or whether the benefit was not appropriate for that claimant. Then there would be a second assessment about which group he should fall into&#151;in other words, a slightly more severe test. I assumed that there would be a third test to identify the procedures that the claimant needed to undergo in order to get as close to the employment market as possible.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000102"></a>From what the Minister said, I understand that health professionals will be used to make the assessment in the first two tests&#151;and the Minister nods, so I am right. But what about the third test? It needs knowledge of health disability matters and employment matters. I assume that somebody else will be involved here. Perhaps the noble Baroness will give me an answer on that.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000103"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07022081000198"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> It needs to be made clear that although the Bill has separate clauses&#151;Clause 8 and Clause 9&#151;in reality, as far as the customer is concerned, there will be one assessment. The assessments are separated for the purposes of the Bill, but for the customer and the health professional they will be one discrete assessment. It might help if we talk about the work-focused assessment next.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000104"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07022081000199"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> That is extremely helpful, and I have not had the assessments explained to me in that way before. So there will be two assessments, but only for the work-focused group. For everyone else, there will be a single assessment. Is that correct?</p>

<p><a name="07022081000105"></a><b><a name="70220-gc0008.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07022081000200"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> From the customer&#146;s point of view, they will have an assessment that will look at entitlement for ESA and at their limited capability for work-related activity; one assessment will look at those two strands. Then there will be a separate work-focused health-related assessment. It is the important new element introduced in the Bill and will look at the capabilities of a person and at the barriers that need to be overcome: the positive side, not the limited capabilities side.</p>

As I understood her, the Minister said that the department had not yet decided whether that assessment would be made by the same people who made the first assessment. Since knowledge of the employment market is so important in this, it would be sensible for the assessments to be conducted by different people. I leave that thought with the Minister. She might want to say something now, but I would be happy to have a letter on the subject on the department&#146;s current thinking.</p>

This amendment is about the consistency of testing, which to an extent we covered in our discussions just now. These amendments place a requirement on the Secretary of State to ensure that the assessments will be of a consistent standard across the country, and of course that depends on the training we have just been talking about. Other parts of the Bill, particularly the clause enabling the contracting out of service provision to third-party organisations, will lead to the possibility that claimants will have to suffer a postcode lottery in the quality and rigour of the assessments&#151;or, rather, not the assessments, I hope, because they are under departmental control, but certainly the post-assessment support from the personal advisers.</p>

Although some flexibility is a good thing when it comes to responding sensibly to unique individual circumstances, that should not be taken to the extreme of allowing individual providers to go their own way. Can the Minister explain what steps will be taken to monitor how these assessments will be undertaken? Without sufficiently rigorous supervision, there will be no way of knowing whether the criteria for eligibility are being applied fairly across the whole country, and no remedial measures can be taken.</p>

The pilot Pathways to Work experience suggested that in carefully picked areas of the country, things were capable of being handled, and lessons have been learnt. But some geographical locations, such as the travel-to-work area around Merthyr Tydfil, the north-east and the heavy industrialised areas, have a high stock of incapacity benefit claimants. The circumstances that apply in the small number of areas covered by the pilot is qualitatively different in terms of problems being faced, labour market conditions, culture, background and the way in which the department is able to deploy this policy.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000116"></a>It is right for the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, to ask for assurances about consistency of assessments. The department is living in cloud-cuckoo-land if it thinks that conditions in Basildon are the same as those in Merthyr Tydfil, because they are not. If we do not recognise that right from the beginning, consistency of assessment will fail and the department will miss an opportunity with regard to the scale of the support measures necessary to deal with the spatial geographical incidence of the unemployment figures resulting from the collapse of the large-scale smokestack industries.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000117"></a>Can the Minister widen the questions raised by the amendments to deal with the quantity, level and scale of the difficulty faced by the personal advisers in Jobcentre Plus in these special areas of the United Kingdom?</p>

The drive behind these developments is to focus on the right of all people to benefit from employment. We know that in particular parts of the country, long-term economic inactivity is leading to appalling deprivation for families and single people, and it is essential that we address this. When my noble friend and I visited the Basildon Pathways to Work pilot, issues of how far we can roll out the positive experiences of a pilot nationally were at the forefront of our mind. One of the Pathways to Work pilots is in Rhondda Cynon Taf, which can hardly be described as an affluent area. There is a lot of learning to be done, and that learning is seen as very important. The department is not rushing to roll this out across the country without taking into account the huge variation in distribution of need.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000122"></a>It is a fundamental principle of any benefit entitlement decision that it should be applied consistently across the country. It would not be appropriate for entitlement to ESA to be based on standards that vary in different areas of the country, rather than being based on the condition of the individual customer.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000123"></a>The PCA already addresses the requirements of consistency in a number of ways. First, it is based on defined criteria by which limited capability for work is assessed&#151;the descriptors and scores in the draft regulations. These descriptors focus on whether a person's condition has resulted in him having limited capability for work, not on whether he has a named condition. Different people may have different levels of functional limitation arising from the same disabling condition. The approach that we have taken with the PCA descriptors avoids this problem by assessing limited capability for work in a consistent and objective way against the same set of descriptors, regardless of where the assessment is carried out or by whom.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70220-gc0009.htm"/>


<a name="70220-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000124"></a>Secondly, healthcare professionals carrying out the medical examination that forms part of the PCA are trained to standards prescribed by the department's chief medical adviser before they are approved by the Secretary of State to carry out the medical examinations. They must subsequently maintain those standards to keep that approval. The quality of their reports and the advice they give to the decision-maker on the basis of paper evidence is monitored on a regular basis, again measured against clearly defined standards prescribed by the chief medical adviser for the Department for Work and Pensions. These standards are used in all medical services centres; and their use will be regularly audited to ensure that they are being applied consistently. We will continue to take these measures in relation to the revised PCA to ensure that it maintains this consistent approach when it is applied for the purposes of the ESA, both for the tests of limited capability for work, dealt with in Clause 8, and limited capability for work-related activity, dealt with in Clause 9.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000125"></a>There were further questions about the decision-maker. Formally, the Secretary of State delegates decisions to the decision-maker, who takes all the information provided by the assessment process and formally makes the decision for benefit entitlement. I hope that that answers that question.</p>

<a name="70220-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07022081000126"></a>I was asked what we were doing about monitoring the quality of medical reports. Sub-standard reports are a minority and I am pleased to say that Atos Origin Medical Services, which carries out the assessments, regularly monitors a statistically valid sample of reports that come out of this assessment and fewer than 5 per cent of them are unsatisfactory. Atos Origin has a programme of continuous quality improvement, which its audit results demonstrate is effective in driving up standards. Doctors who fail to meet standards are given feedback and remedial training. Their work continues to be closely monitored until they have reached the required standard. Importantly, if they fail to reach the standard despite retraining, their approval to carry out the assessments is revoked.</p>

<p><a name="07022081000127"></a>I do not believe that making provision in legislation for the PCA to be applied consistently would enhance or improve the systems already in place, although it is extremely important. It would limit our flexibility to respond as necessary to situations that call for a change to the current processes we have in place. I therefore urge the noble Lords to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Whether he was right or wrong, the current PCA is stringent, and I understand that the new test with the new descriptors will be even more stringent. In broad terms, the mental health assessment has been improved, but the physical assessment has been significantly tightened. Lower-scoring descriptors have been removed, which could potentially exclude people with significant but lower-level impairments from receiving the benefit. Indeed, an early small-scale trial found that more than half of those who currently pass the PCA because of a physical impairment would fail the revised tests. That would impact in a number of ways. When current

People with lower-level physical impairments, who might benefit most from some of the support programmes available through ESA, might end up failing the revised PCA and being excluded from the support programmes. The only benefit available to them would presumably be the jobseekers&#146; allowance.</p>

We are now moving someway from that assessment. We are looking at an assessment that takes into account significant changes in employment experienced by people with disabilities and long-term conditions, as well as a change in the distribution between mental health problems and physical disabilities in people claiming incapacity benefit. We need to recognise that things have moved on quite significantly. There has been a limited evaluation of the PCA, which has looked at the current and revised PCAs. We are in the early stages of evaluating the effects of the developments, and it would be unfair to suggest that the revised PCA is such a stringent test.</p>

<a name="70220-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07022048000023"></a>Changes to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 for England came into force today introducing a new permitted development right to help mitigate the current increased risk of avian influenza (&#147;bird flu&#148;).</p>

<a name="70220-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07022048000024"></a>Following the recent outbreak of avian influenza on a farm in Suffolk, Defra has taken measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including the culling of all birds on the infected premises, putting in place a three kilometre protection zone and a 10 kilometre surveillance zone around the infected area and a restriction zone covering approximately 2090km2 of north-east Suffolk and south-east Norfolk. In all of those zones, bird keepers are required to house their birds or, if that is not practical, otherwise isolate them from contact with wild birds.</p>

<a name="70220-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07022048000025"></a>In order to help deal with the current increased risk of avian influenza nationwide, the Government have decided to assist poultry farmers and owners of other captive birds by granting planning permission in the whole of England for temporary and reversible works to shelter poultry and other captive birds from contact with wild birds. Landowners will be allowed to erect a building with a ground area of up to 465 square metres, or extend an existing building by up to 50 per cent. Any such development will be permitted to remain standing for as long as it is necessary to protect poultry and other captive birds from avian influenza, but not beyond 12 months. After such time, the structures will either need to be removed and the land restored to its original condition or to any condition as agreed between the local planning authority and the developer or planning permission for a permanent structure will need to be sought.</p>

It is said that he kept so-called &#147;special case&#148; files containing original medical records relating to his patients that were not also kept on the child's proper hospital file. Concerns have been raised that in some of those cases criminal proceedings may have been taken but the existence of the files not revealed, resulting in their not being disclosed as part of the prosecution process. I share those concerns.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07022048000028"></a>What is not clear at this stage is the nature and extent of the failure of disclosure, if such it be. I have therefore decided that I will conduct an assessment of the cases where Professor Southall was instructed as a prosecution witness to determine whether any &#147;special case&#148; files existed in any cases involving criminal proceedings. Once that assessment has been completed, I will decide what, if any, further review is required.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_181"></a><a name="07022048000208"></a>The Government announced last year that restrictions on smoking in enclosed workplaces, public places and vehicles would be introduced in England from 1 July 2007. These provisions are described in the Health Act 2006 which aims to act on medical and scientific advice. This will save thousands of lives over the next decade by reducing both exposure to hazardous second-hand smoke and overall smoking rates.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_182"></a><a name="07022048000209"></a>The Health Act 2006 includes provisions designed to prohibit smoking in enclosed public places and vehicles, but does not cover vessels operating at sea or on inland waters. I now intend to introduce similar provisions to provide protection from second-hand smoke for people on vessels operating in UK waters, both at sea and on inland waterways.</p>

<a name="70220-wms0002.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_183"></a><a name="07022048000210"></a>On 14 February, I launched a consultation paper asking for comments as to how smoke free provisions should be implemented on sea-going and inland-waterways vessels. The provisions under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 will apply to all vessels operating in UK inland waters or within the 12 mile territorial waters, regardless of which country they are flagged with, provided they carry passengers or employees. I am also keen to see these provisions extended to Wales and Northern Ireland and for a consistent set of restrictions to be established in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_184"></a><a name="07022048000211"></a>In line with the Health Act 2006, I am proposing that owners and operators of vessels may provide for residents and guests on merchant ships to be allowed

<p><a name="wms_stpa_368"></a><a name="07022048000406"></a>The first and main item is preparation for the spring European Council, which will be held on the 8-9 March 2007. The key messages paper, prepared by the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee, identifies the key messages emerging from the various other reports for adoption and endorsement at the March Council.

This will be held on 7 March in advance of the spring European Council to allow the European social partners to feed in their views to the spring Council. Attendees are the current presidency, the two subsequent presidencies (Portugal and Slovenia), the Commission and the social partners.</p>

The exchange of views on <I>Structuring the European Debate on Demographic Change</I> will be the main discussion on the Council's agenda. I shall insist that Europe should avoid the temptation to set up new or duplicate processes at EU level where perfectly good mechanisms already exist. We need to place any new actions we take within the context of achieving greater growth and jobs and the existing open method of co-ordination. Within the context of demographic change in Europe, the Council will also be asked to adopt a resolution on the contribution of older people to economic and social development.</p>

<a name="70220-wms0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_372"></a><a name="07022048000411"></a>The Government are today announcing three steps to modernise the tax system to remove obstacles to competition and expand choice in trading financial instruments in the UK. They will allow firms to benefit from the new opportunities offered by liberalisation of financial regulation in the European Union, and specifically from the introduction of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID).</p>

<a name="70220-wms0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_373"></a><a name="07022048000412"></a>First, from November 2007, the Government will no longer require transactions in shares admitted to trading on a regulated market under MiFID to be reported to that market, or those intermediaries to be  


<notus-date day="20" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS71"></a><b>20 Feb 2007 : Column WS71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>members of that market, in order for intermediaries to benefit from stamp duty relief. Currently, relief from stamp duty is available for intermediaries that trade securities listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) only if they are members of the LSE and they report their trades to the LSE. This will allow new providers of transaction reporting services to enter the market more easily. The Government are today publishing draft clauses for consultation in advance of this year's Finance Bill.</p>

<a name="70220-wms0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_374"></a><a name="07022048000413"></a>Secondly, the Government are announcing that, in addition to shares admitted to trading on a regulated market, they also intend to extend this approach to include shares admitted to trading on a multilateral trading facility (MTF). Currently, in order to benefit from stamp duty relief, intermediaries trading in such securities are required to report transactions to the market on which the securities are admitted to trade. The Government intend to remove this requirement, in order further to extend choice in transaction reporting. However, before proceeding with this proposal, the Government are providing time for the Financial Services Authority to consider fully any possible regulatory implications from this change and will provide an update on progress at the pre-Budget report.</p>

<a name="70220-wms0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_375"></a><a name="07022048000414"></a>Thirdly, the Government also propose to modernise the definition of a recognised stock exchange for tax purposes to allow shares traded on other regulated markets under MiFID to benefit from the same tax arrangements that currently apply only to the LSE in the UK. For example, this will allow shares listed by the UK Listing Authority and traded on a regulated market under MiFID to be held in an individual savings account or to meet the listing requirement to be a UK real estate investment trust. The Government will publish draft clauses in advance of this year's Finance Bill.</p>

<a name="70220-wms0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_376"></a><a name="07022048000415"></a>Taken together, these changes will help expand choice and increase competition in the provision of services to trade financial instruments in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_377"></a><a name="07022048000416"></a>The Government have been a leading proponent of the need to improve competition and efficiency in Europe's securities markets for three reasons:</p>
 first, to ensure that capital markets play their full role in financing the long-term investment needs of the wider economy as efficiently as possible;

<a name="70220-wms0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_378"></a><a name="07022048000417"></a>The Government have supported the introduction of greater competition through MiFID. The UK is the only major financial centre in the European Union to transpose the MiFID by the deadline of 31 January. This gives UK-based financial firms the maximum time to prepare for the impact of the new trading environment.</p>

<a name="70220-wms0004.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_379"></a><a name="07022048000418"></a>Today's announcement removes other unnecessary non-regulatory obstacles to greater competition in trading financial instruments by modernising the tax system to bring it closer into line with the liberalised regulatory environment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_380"></a><a name="07022048000419"></a>These announcements today coincide with an informal meeting of the high level group on City competitiveness, during which senior figures from the UK-based financial services sector met European Commissioners Charlie McCreevy and Neelie Kroes to discuss the future direction of financial services policy in Europe, including developments in trading securities.</p>

It followed the extensive consultation we undertook on the proposals set out in the final report by Lord Carter of Coles, published on 13 July 2006.

We have already made changes to the timing, sequencing and detail of some of Lord Carter's proposals.</p>

We seek to increase co-operation with China within multilateral fora and initiatives relevant to Africa in areas such as transparency, aid and debt principles and arms transfers. All Africa's partners, including China, need to work in ways that reinforce Africa's own agenda of poverty reduction and sustainable development. The Department for International Development has already established regular high-level talks with China on international development issues, focusing on Africa, and China and the EU agreed at their September 2006 summit to establish a structured dialogue on Africa. The German presidency hopes to begin this dialogue soon and we look forward to contributing actively. We welcome the commitment in China's first White Paper on Africa, published in January last year, to &#147;step up co-operation with other countries and international organisations&#148; in support of the millennium development goals in Africa.</p>

The trade can, if managed unsustainably, also damage wild populations. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, to which the UK and EU member states are parties, has arrangements that aim to regulate trade in some endangered wild birds so as not to be detrimental to their survival in the wild. Before agreeing to any ban on conservation grounds we would need to first consider the effectiveness of those controls. We could not press for a ban on welfare grounds, as this would not comply with World Trade Organisation agreements.</p>

However, this is more than compensated for by an even larger uptake of carbon by photosynthesis, which is enhanced at elevated carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. When this is taken into account, these processes give rise to a net sink of approximately 9.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year. This acts to slow the rate of rise of atmospheric CO2 caused by emissions from fossil fuel combustion and changes in land use by humans, mainly deforestation.</p>

<a name="70220w0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_64"></a><a name="07022062000163"></a>If this sink&#151;and a similar sink in the oceans&#151;did not exist, the CO2 rise would be approximately twice as fast as currently observed. Identifying uncultivated land, swamps and bogs within this total is very uncertain but these land areas are probably responsible for most of the net sink. Natural wetlands are also a source of methane emissions amounting to some 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>

In response to this increase, HMRC has strengthened its operational strategy, increasing the level of criminal investigations with international partners in Europe and beyond and re-deploying over 700 extra compliance resources in order to check a greater number of suspect VAT repayment claims submitted by those operating in supply chains known to be associated with MTIC fraud.</p>
