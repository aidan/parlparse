We believe that more could and should be done. That is why consultation on a national dementia strategy that we published last month includes a recommendation and plans for building on the existing UK research base.</p>

Do not 700,000 people already suffer from this terrible disease? That number is forecast to double in the next 20 years, at a cost to the Exchequer of about &#163;34 billion. Many leading scientists have warned that that could destroy the National Health Service. Does not that make the Government&#146;s investment of a mere &#163;25 million, only 3 per cent of the Department of Health&#146;s research budget, look totally inadequate?</p>

We are committed to supporting and enabling more research on dementia. A significant amount of money, &#163;29 million, is being invested today. In addition, the Department is investing &#163;20 million over five years for the national research network on dementia and neurodegenerative diseases, DeNDRoN, plus several new initiatives involving amounts of &#163;6 million to &#163;8 million. Since 1997, the increase is from &#163;5.9 million to &#163;29 million in the past

That shows that we are committed to that research. In the next years, we are attempting to use the model of the way that cancer research was built so successfully in the UK. That means investing in relevant research networks and centres but, as the noble Baroness will be only too well aware, it is extremely important that only science that achieves the highest quality assessment should receive funding.</p>

A number of drugs have been introduced that are simply symptomatic treatments, such as Donepezil, but work that is now being done in many centres, not least on the superb new campus for ageing and health on the Newcastle General Hospital site where major research is being undertaken, shows great promise of developing drugs that strike at the cause of the disease. Does not this development justify significantly greater investment in this important field?</p>

Part of the Government&#146;s drive to ensure that NICE processes the findings and implications of new treatments as rapidly as possible includes NICE issuing guidance on drugs to treat Alzheimer&#146;s and other dementia diseases as quickly as it can.</p>

It is insignificant by any standards, and I am astonished that she should make that claim in this House. No Government have a good record on dementia. I welcome their recent announcement that they are developing a national dementia strategy. Nevertheless, the real requirement now is for a massive injection of funds, because with them, anything is possible. Without them, dementia will remain for ever the pathetic orphan of medicine. That simply will not do in this House.</p>

There is absolutely no doubt that more funding needs to be found and will be found. The other point that I was making is that there is no point putting in extra money if the research base does not provide the highest quality science that we need to deal with this dreadful condition.</p>

Although the money that we are putting in seems a lot, the Americans are putting in &#163;64 million for the equivalent of our population. We are putting in &#163;29 million. Is it not essential to see that young scientists are encouraged to enter this field? Unless we can get young scientists interested in this, we will not have a succession of people who can do the necessary research.</p>

Is my noble friend aware that that trust, which does not receive public money, is forced to turn away about two out of three of the research applications that are put to it because of lack of resources?

As part of the strategy that was announced by my honourable friend the Minister last month, a dementia research summit will be held in the autumn to bring together the key stakeholders, particularly the relevant charities and voluntary organisations, so that they can take an active part in developing the future research agenda. I am absolutely certain that they will make that point very clearly indeed.</p>

The amount of money that is being put into the care of people with long-term illnesses such as dementia means that we are about average.

In this context, are the Government able to concentrate with the Russians on the dumbing down of the media, the harassment and, indeed, murder of journalists, the curbing of NGO activity, manipulation of the law and, whatever the propaganda by the Russians in this respect, the continued sinister oppression in Chechnya?

I should like to assure him that the Government last year spent some &#163;700,000 on human rights projects in Russia.

In fact, between this country and Russia, they have been going very badly.

Lastly, can he confirm once again that, in the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement that we are negotiating, we must insist on the rule of law to underpin not only human rights but also economic relations and foreign investment?

These provide credible, regional, internationally-binding legal instruments. The UK remains fully committed to the negative security assurance we gave to the non-nuclear weapons states parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in our 1995 letter to the UN Secretary-General, subsequently noted in Security Council Resolution 984.</p>

Can I persuade him and your Lordships, first, that a treaty of the kind suggested would draw attention to the need to eliminate completely all nuclear weapons? Secondly, would it not dissuade those powers which do not have such weapons from acquiring them? Finally, would it not make it easier for the smaller states that possess nuclear weapons to destroy them? Would that not improve the situation quite a lot?</p>

But we believe that through both the assurances given to NPT signatory states that they would not face nuclear attack unless they attacked in alliance with other nuclear weapon states, and through the regional agreements which have allowed us to give 100 countries further such assurances, we will achieve the purpose he wants. The actions of others, such as a number of noble Lords and Baronesses in this House who have signed up to different initiatives leading towards a nuclear-free zone like their counterparts in the US, provide the goal that the noble Lord wants to see of attention being given to the objective of a nuclear-free world.</p>

The UK Government have been supporting the development of these options because we believe that both within the forthcoming review of the NPT and more generally in our disposition of arrangements for a nuclear-free world it is vital to provide safe sources of nuclear power to those who wish to pursue that option.</p>

Does he further accept that we on this side support the long-term vision of a world free of nuclear weapons if that can be achieved? We realise that there are considerable difficulties&#151;it would take time and would require the fully verifiable destruction of every nuclear weapon&#151;but we believe that this is the right guiding light for policy makers in the years ahead and will support all endeavours in that direction.</p>

I refer again to the article by that extraordinary group of American leaders, including Secretary Shultz and Secretary Kissinger, and more recently the article in the <I>Times</I> by Sir Malcolm Rifkind and the noble Lords, Lord Hurd, Lord Robertson and Lord Owen, which laid out a similar vision of the objective of a nuclear-free world while recognising the complex, extended negotiations that it will take to get us there.

There are two more treaties, covering south-east Asia and central Asia, that need further work for us to be able to support them fully. The same principles apply to the Arctic. We are in favour of as many of these regional agreements as possible, so long as they are sensibly drafted to ensure that all countries are bound by them and that they apply in an equal way the principle of non-nuclear use.</p>

Will he first confirm that until a few weeks ago the listing of the PMOI in Europe rested entirely on its listing domestically in the United Kingdom? Secondly, will he confirm that two superior courts in the United Kingdom, including the Court of Appeal, after scrutinising all the evidence, declared that its listing here was unjustified and perverse, and that Parliament has endorsed an order to remove it from the list? Thirdly, will he confirm that the European Court of First Instance has declared that its initial listing was unlawful? Given all that, would my noble friend agree that the continued listing of the PMOI demonstrates a shameful indifference to human rights or an abject capitulation to the Iranian Government&#151;and, in either case, a repudiation of the rule of law?</p>

How could any evidence presented by France to justify a new listing have escaped the notice of those who represented Her Majesty&#146;s Government before the Court of Appeal, and not therefore have been known to that court when it gave its judgment? It follows, therefore, that by not opposing this matter the British Government were spitting in the face of a court in this country, the Court of Appeal.</p>

We were determined to respect that court decision, which is why we were not able to support the Government who brought to the table new information that had not been available earlier, on the basis of which they were able to persuade many Governments of Europe to support them. As to why we abstained rather than opposing the listing, the difficulty is that it is a total list with all terrorist organisations on it, and you have to vote up or down on that list. We were therefore faced with the unpalatable situation that either the old list would be retained, which would have done no good because the PMOI would have remained on it, or we would have been left with no listed terrorist organisations in Europe. We felt that was an unacceptable threat to the people of Britain as well as the rest of the Continent.</p>

The Second Reading was secured without a Division and, by the time the petitioning period for this House&#146;s Select Committee had closed, 113 petitions had been deposited. The Select Committee of this House did a sterling job; it sat for 29 days and listened to many of the same petitioners. I am sure that the House will join me in paying tribute to the skill and rigour with which the committee was chaired by the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross. The Select Committee published its excellent special report in May, so we could consider it alongside the Committee proceedings.</p>

Finally, I mention the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, for her unwavering support for the project.</p>

I begin by thanking the Minister for the manner in which he accepted our scrutiny and listened to our concerns and amendments. He has covered the points about the hybrid Bill very well already. Although he rarely agreed with our position, the debate has provided your Lordships and the public with valuable information about some of the finer details of this complex piece of legislation.</p>

<a name="80722-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08072254000115"></a>A legal framework to facilitate the funding and construction of Crossrail has been long in coming. I remember when this project was first conceived, nearly 20 years ago; since then, its progress has been stalled by a plethora of reviews and seen many false dawns. I think that a dairy farmer would be impressed by the number of times that this Government have announced that Crossrail was to go ahead. Since finally obtaining a finance package last year, there has been a high level of scrutiny which benefits this Bill, but that has not been too protracted in this House.</p>

<a name="80722-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08072254000116"></a>I pay my own tribute to the work of the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross, and his committee, the noble Lords, Lord Snape, Lord James of Blackheath, Lord Young of Norwood Green and Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe.</p>

<a name="80722-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08072254000117"></a>It has been clear from the start that we on these Benches have always supported the Crossrail project in principle, but throughout the progress of the Bill in this House and in another place we have raised concerns relating to transparency and disruption. We would have liked to have seen the Government go further on some issues such as ensuring that disruption is kept to a minimum through earlier notification and being more open in taking a transparent and consistent approach to reporting.</p>

<a name="80722-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08072254000118"></a>As expected, funding has always been a major worry. We are concerned about the cost of the Government&#146;s delay in getting Crossrail to this stage, which has been estimated at &#163;1.5 billion per annum. We are also concerned about whether the current &#163;16 billion funding package is sufficient and that taxpayers have already spent &#163;400 million without a single track being laid. The main reason for that apprehension is that mega-projects such as this often span the life of more than one Government. Who knows; by the time of completion we may have a Liberal Democrat Government. Therefore, it is imperative that we get the legislation right now in order to avoid problems in the future.</p>

<a name="80722-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08072254000119"></a>In closing, the benefits that Crossrail will bring are undoubted; it could add &#163;20 billion to the UK economy and support an expected 30,000 new high-value jobs. Crossrail will also provide greater capacity and speed to the city's transport network, enabling a further

One of the objectives of the Select Committee in producing what appears to be rather a fat report was to include in the appendices a lot of information that ought to make things a great deal more transparent for those who might be affected by the Bill. Therefore, I hope that we have added to the general knowledge about what will happen, the remedies that people have and the sort of conditions that they might expect.

One of the lessons of the success of the Alloa railway, where the loadings proved to be three times greater than forecast, was that we should have got on with it earlier. I would like to carry that forward and say, please introduce a high-speed line railway Bill, because we are about to need it now, not after we have legislated for it, which will probably be in about 20 years&#146; time.

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08072254000125"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I have worked closely with my right honourable friend the Leader of another place to ensure that proposals for another place also cover your Lordships' House. I have consulted with usual channels colleagues and with the House Committee about the introduction of this order and I am grateful for their support.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08072254000126"></a>It is my strong contention that to carry out our duties in your Lordships' House properly, we have to be able to speak freely without fear or favour. We must be able to say what we believe to be true about difficult or controversial issues and we must be able to do so without feeling that we could be putting ourselves or our families at risk. Section 7 of the Freedom of Information Act allows for the Act to be amended in  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1656"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the light of developing circumstances such as these. The section permits the Secretary of State to make an order limiting the scope of the Act&#146;s application to specific information held by a particular body. The order amends Schedule 1, which covers which bodies are subject to the Act. The order will exclude four categories of information, if held by either House or the National Assembly for Wales, from the scope of the Act. This will mean that the response to any request for information falling into these categories will be that the House does not hold such information for the purposes of the Act.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08072254000127"></a>The four categories of information are, first, residential addresses of any Member. This means that information relating to any residential address held by either House, regardless of whether a claim has been made in respect of it or not, will no longer be covered by the Act. &#147;Residential address&#148; includes a Member&#146;s main or alternative place of residence, including any temporary accommodation such as a hotel, a holiday home or any grace-and-favour residences&#151;that is, those that come from a job. Members will know that, unlike another place, the House of Lords authorities do not hold addresses in relation to claims for expenses except in relation to travel. However, any information the House holds on addresses will now be outside the scope of the Act.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08072254000128"></a>The second category is information as to regular or forthcoming travel arrangements for any Member. &#147;Forthcoming travel arrangements&#148; means any travel that, at the date of a relevant freedom of information request, has not yet taken place. Disclosure of this information might endanger the Member or Members undertaking that journey. &#147;Regular travel&#148; covers any journey between two points using any mode of transport that happens at broadly the same time&#151;for example, each day, week or month&#151;knowledge of which could put a Member&#146;s personal safety at risk. Information on the amount spent by Members on regular travel during any calendar month will remain subject to the Act. However, any further breakdown of expenditure&#151;for example by week or day&#151;will not be, as it could enable the identification of a regular travel pattern.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08072254000129"></a>The third category is information that would enable the identification of any person who has delivered goods or provided services to a Member at any residence of the Member. This provision is of more relevance to Members of another place, who are entitled to make claims for goods and services received in relation to homes they maintain in order to fulfil their parliamentary or constituency responsibility. This House&#146;s Members&#146; reimbursement allowance scheme contains no analogous provision.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08072254000130"></a>The fourth category is that of information relating to expenditure by a Member on security arrangements. Again, this issue is relevant to Members of another place, who are entitled to make claims for expenditure in relation to security arrangements at their addresses. All the provisions I have outlined also apply to the National Assembly for Wales. I beg to move.</p>

It brings to an end, I hope, the most unsatisfactory and unedifying spectacle of a deep disagreement between the authorities of another place and the Information Commissioner on the publication of private addresses of Members of another place and, I suppose by extension, those of your Lordships. From that point of view, the order is very much to be welcomed for the reasons that the noble Baroness has outlined, particularly in view of many of the security aspects affecting Members of both Houses.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08072254000133"></a>Will the noble Baroness confirm that the order extends equally to all Members of this House as well as to those of another place? The noble Baroness has said that it extends to Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. For information, will the noble Baroness tell us the position for the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Scottish Parliament? They are clearly excluded from these provisions. Do they have their own arrangements or are they planning on doing something else? There is no need for the noble Baroness to give me an answer today, but perhaps she could write to me and let me know.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08072254000134"></a>Finally, this order has raised the fact that issues in the Freedom of Information Act need clarifying. It is not that anybody is trying to hide information from greater public scrutiny, but this has raised all sorts of questions about the nature of the information requested, by whom it is requested and the use to which it is put. Have the Government plans to review the working of the Freedom of Information Act to see whether any changes should be made in the foreseeable future?</p>

<a name="08072254000135"></a><a name="80722-0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80722-0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08072254000453"></a>Lord Addington:</b> My Lords, we on these Benches have absolutely no objection to making these changes to the Freedom of Information Act. I am not sure that I can entirely agree with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, but certainly there should be reasonable limits on the information that can safely be given out so that it does not endanger those engaged in certain activities. This measure is a bold first step in attempting to set those reasonable limits. One could argue about what are appropriate requests for information and what are vexatious, and whether the Act gives some journalists a licence to become voyeuristic about other people&#146;s lives, but I shall not go too far down that route today. The order constitutes a reasonable compromise that safeguards national and personal security. As I say, we have no objection to it.</p>

Therefore, I hope that the Government will provide the Information Commissioner with sufficient powers to ensure that these data are protected, wherever they are located. As we well know from past reports of the Information Commissioner, there is, unfortunately, a propensity to try to purchase this information. Therefore, I hope that these data are held in a suitably secure,

It will not surprise noble Lords to hear me say that I keep a paternal eye on orders that affect the Freedom of Information Act, and that I try to assess the effect of any orders on the original Act. I remind the House that the whole purpose of the Act is to empower the citizen to challenge the apparatus of the state, particularly that of the Executive, and to extend their own freedom.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08072254000139"></a>As regards an observation made by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, I should point out that when we drew up the first semblances of the Act in the original Bill, we excluded Parliament. We felt that if Parliament were included it would be so easy for the press to have a go at MPs and Members of this House and neglect where the real power lies in Great Britain; namely, in the Executive. That is exactly what has happened. I am not saying that it was wrong to include it, but that was the judgment that we made at the time.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08072254000140"></a>The security of Members of this House and the other place is paramount. We should not forget that only 25 years ago, or even less, we all went through a heavy security curtain. I clearly remember the days when the police gave briefings on security for our constituency homes. We also had to search underneath our cars every time we went out in them. We forget those things now but they were very real at the time. We all hope that those days never come again, but it would be foolish to forget them.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08072254000141"></a>My last point is very important. The families of Members in both Houses of Parliament usually make a great sacrifice so that we can be here to try to serve the nation. Particularly in the other House, where Members may traditionally have had younger families, there is real pressure, real fear and real tension. Members from provincial seats come down to London on a Sunday night or Monday morning and return on a Thursday or Friday, but their families are left up there, often on their own. I can well recall my wife being frightened&#151;I would almost say to death&#151;during a period in the 1980s when, literally at 4 am, there was a braying at the door. She went to the upstairs window, and a policeman was outside saying, &#147;Under no account must you open any parcel that might be delivered to your house&#148;. Of course that was a helpful intervention&#151;the police were delivering a warning&#151;but you can imagine the fear of a woman living on her own with a young family in that situation.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08072254000142"></a>It is therefore right and proper to insist that a certain amount of privacy should be given to Members of Parliament of both Houses. This order is a correct procedure and I welcome it as a step in the right direction.</p>

I say to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that we have not had discussions with Northern Ireland, but we are very happy to do so. Such discussions may well take place.

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08072254000144"></a>My noble friend Lord Clark eloquently reminded us of the history, and noble Lords who were in another place will remember only too well the difficulties and the dangers. However, we have also had recent examples: noble Lords will recall that my right honourable friend has twice had visitors on her roof from the organisation that calls itself Fathers for Justice. So there are real issues of concern in any event. We are confident that we have protected every Member of your Lordships&#146; House through this move. I am informed by the Clerk who looks after this information that it is kept secure, so the noble Earl, Lord Errol, need not worry about that. We will ensure that any requests are dealt with appropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08072254000145"></a>We do not have plans to review the Act more formally. As noble Lords may recall, I was the Minister responsible for freedom of information. The Act was brought in not to support journalistic enquiries into issues about your Lordships&#146; House or another place, important though those are, but to enable ordinary citizens to find out information from public bodies in their locality, whether that is their health service, their local schools or another body. I think that we all recognise the importance and value of that. However, as with any piece of information, context is everything. We must continually strive to ensure that when information is released, people understand the context of what that information actually explains to the person who requested it, rather than, as we have occasionally seen, simply seeing the stark fact without realising its relevance.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08072254000146"></a>There are continuous discussions to ensure that the Information Commissioner has the necessary relevant powers.

In March this year the committee produced its report <I>The Use of Restraint in Secure Training Centres</I>, and the Government published their response on 17 July, just in time for this debate.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08072254000150"></a>The House will know that secure training centres house young offenders aged between 12 and 17 who are too vulnerable or young to be in young offender institutes run by the Prison Service. These centres are privately run, and there are four in the UK, at Medway, Oakhill, Hassockfield and Rainsbrook. The young people held there often have a violent background, and the use of violence against them needs to be avoided. This is not just a matter of training staff, but of developing strategies in secure training centres to

By any standards, these are the very people most in need of human rights protection. The Ministry of Justice is responsible for legislation and for the Youth Justice Board, which oversees contracts for STCs and places children and young people into institutions.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08072254000151"></a>In July 2007, the new Secure Training Centre (Amendment) Rules came into force. They were not subject to parliamentary debate at the time. The rules allow staff in STCs to use force to,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000325"></a>&#147;ensure good order and discipline&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000293"></a>Legitimate techniques, called &#147;physical control in care&#148;, include restraint holds and something called distraction techniques; that is,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000326"></a>&#147;inflicting pain to thumb, ribs or nose&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000294"></a>In fairness, I should point out that the nose distraction technique has since been suspended.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08072254000152"></a>I understand that, about two years ago, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, on behalf of the Howard League for Penal Reform, investigated the use of restraints. As a result, the Government decided to hold their own inquiry but, so far, that has not been published. Could the Minister enlighten the House about when the report and the Government&#146;s comments on it might be available?</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08072254000153"></a>The key conclusion of the JCHR report is that the effect of current UK law is that the Government have sanctioned violence against children and young people. We say that force used against young people and children in detention is &#147;rarely acceptable&#148; and requires significant justification. The practice runs the risk of breaching international human rights standards under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. According to that convention, the state needs to ensure that restraint does,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000327"></a>&#147;not involve deliberate infliction of pain as a form of control&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000295"></a>In its report in 2002-03, the JCHR said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000328"></a>&#147;the level of physical assault and the degree of physical restraint experienced by children in detention ... represent unacceptable contraventions of [the] UNCRC&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000296"></a>Detention techniques, according to the Youth Justice Board,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000329"></a>&#147;rely on techniques which create pain&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000297"></a>We heard evidence in which a young person, who subsequently died in a secure training centre, wrote a note saying that he had been punched in the nose and was told that that was an example of restraint.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08072254000154"></a>Even more sadly, two young people have died in STCs following restraint. Their inquests took place in the past year. The Government claimed that their reason for introducing the new amendment rules was to respond to the coroner&#146;s recommendation regarding the death of one of the young people. In their response, the Government seem to dismiss the committee&#146;s concern and the Government&#146;s obligations under the UN convention by explaining that the UN committee&#146;s comments are,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000330"></a>&#147;not binding on signatory states&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000298"></a>The committee and I believe that the Government should seek to meet their obligations under the UN convention, as it seems clear that there is a lawful  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1661"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1661</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sanction of the use of pain against young people in STCs. I welcome the Government's response that they are seeking to,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000331"></a>&#147;reduce the use of physical restraint in STCs&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000299"></a>We on the committee say that the amendment rules are ambiguous because &#147;good order and discipline&#148; is imprecise, broad and inherently subjective. Any confusion caused by the rules and the use of force can have tragic consequences, as we have seen.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08072254000155"></a>The Government insist that &#147;ensuring good order and discipline&#148; is not a catch-all phrase and that force must not be,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000332"></a>&#147;used as a punishment or merely to secure compliance with staff instructions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000300"></a>However, the committee heard evidence about force being used against boys who, for example, refused to go to bed. They were not causing any harm; they simply said that they were not going to go to bed. To use force against them seems to me and the committee to be excessive in the circumstances.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08072254000156"></a>The Government's response was to argue that the committee or others could not judge whether force was legitimate in such an example,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000333"></a>&#147;without an understanding of all the circumstances in which it was made and of the establishment itself&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000301"></a>and that a continual refusal to go to bed might legitimise the decision to use force. My Lords, I beg to differ.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08072254000157"></a>A judicial review case was brought that challenged the new amendment rules. The Government will use the result of that to say that they are right and that the committee has gone too far in its criticisms; I am sure that that will be in the Minister&#146;s brief. The court held that the rules are not legally uncertain, nor do they legitimise treatment which is in breach of Articles 3 or 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, it also stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="08072254000315"></a>&#147;Whether conduct and/or treatment complained of in a future case is contrary to Articles 3 and/or 8 will depend on all the circumstances&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000302"></a>In other words, it may be legitimate to have these rules but the way in which they are given effect to may breach human rights. I could, although I shall not, go into greater detail about the court decision and its consequences.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08072254000158"></a>It is a matter of concern that the Government seem to be suggesting that it can be appropriate to use force in compliance with staff instructions. That goes against the code of practice of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, and I think that the board is right.</p>

<a name="80722-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08072254000159"></a>The rules were brought forward without any human rights impact assessment, which I suppose is legitimate. The committee called in its report and other reports for the Government to address human rights considerations in Explanatory Notes and Memoranda. The Government provide formal compatibility statements with affirmatives and super affirmatives but they say that to provide analysis for every statutory instrument would be onerous. I accept that analysing every SI might be onerous, but the committee recommends:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08072254000316"></a>&#147;Where secondary legislation raises significant human rights implications, we would expect to see sufficient analysis to facilitate effective parliamentary scrutiny&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08072254000303"></a>I should like the Minister to ensure that officials communicate with committee staff with the aim of providing more human rights information on at least some SIs. I repeat that I am talking about SIs which have significant human rights implications, not the whole generality of subordinate legislation. Given that the Minister will himself or herself have to check that these things are human-rights compliant, it is not very much to ask that these matters should be reported publicly.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08072254000160"></a>I welcome the fact that the Government are meeting our recommendation to place in the Libraries of both Houses every six months detailed statistics about the number of restraint incidents. It was difficult for the committee to access this information during the inquiry; this will enable it to continue scrutinising the issue.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08072254000161"></a>Can the Minister suggest how Parliament can assess whether force is always being used legitimately? Can the detailed statistics promised to Parliament include a short commentary on the circumstances in which restraint was used, without going into too much detail about individual cases?</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08072254000162"></a>It is regrettable that the Government will not place in the public domain the manual of constraint techniques. They say that that could be dangerous, but I am not sure that I follow their reasons. Surely having this information in the public domain would allow proper scrutiny and assessment of the physical controls to help to ensure that force did not turn into illegitimate violence.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08072254000163"></a>I believe that the Joint Committee on Human Rights has done a public service in producing the report and highlighting the needs of a small number of extremely vulnerable people. We believe that using violence against people who were subjected to violence before being put into detention can only breed violence. It can hardly lead to them coming out in a more peaceful and less violent frame of mind. The evidence shows that when young people come out of these centres, the likelihood of their reoffending is very high. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. I beg to move.</p>

I am also grateful to him for giving this House the opportunity to discuss in detail the Joint Committee&#146;s report and the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08072254000166"></a>I shall concentrate on two fine lines, which are revealed in the debate between the Joint Committee and the Government. The first fine line revealed is that between restraint and violence. The semantic debate between the committee and the Government on the distinction between force and violence demonstrates how difficult it is to make these distinctions. I hope  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1663"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1663</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the Minister will confirm that any action that can be construed as violence has no place in a secure training centre.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08072254000167"></a>One problem is that restraint can so easily slide into violence. I have considerable admiration for those who undertake the care of challenging children and young people, and I know something of the pressures on them from my visits as a parish priest to such institutions. That makes it all the more crucial that there is clarity that violence is not a part of the sanctions available to them in their work. The quality of care needs to be constantly reinforced by training and by support for front-line staff. I very much welcome the emphasis of both the committee and the Government on the need for training and the improved training now available.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08072254000168"></a>I hope that the Minister will say more about the personal support that is, and must be, provided to staff. They need encouragement to develop a caring relationship with those for whom they are responsible, many of whom have experienced very little care or love in their own lives. They need to do all that they can to ensure that STCs are not themselves bleak and unloving institutions.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08072254000169"></a>In that context, I was particularly pleased to see in the Government&#146;s response a reference to restorative justice, whereby in one of the institutions, at least, staff review the incident of restraint along with the young person concerned. This taking of responsibility by the young person is very much to be welcomed, and I hope that the Government will agree to encourage such developments in the other secure training centres so that restorative justice becomes one of the principles by which relationships are developed and love is shown in STCs.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08072254000170"></a>That taking of responsibility by the child or young person is necessary if we are to maintain another fine line, between restraint and punishment. Again the Government are clear that techniques of restraint are not used as punishment, yet I wonder whether it feels like that to the young person concerned. The difficult examples given by the committee, and to which the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, has referred, sound to me as though the children involved received that treatment as punishment&#151;and undeserved punishment at that. We need to be clear that violence by a child upon child or staff will not be tolerated, but we need to be still more aware that what is perceived as violence by staff upon a child is more dangerous still. This quickly becomes the violence of authority escalating within the secure system and then beyond.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08072254000171"></a>I am currently attending the Lambeth conference of Anglican bishops from all over the world. Indeed, when I asked for consent to be here yesterday and today, the conference asked me to bring its best wishes to all in your Lordships&#146; House. I would not want noble Lords to think that my presence here means that either I or the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Lincoln were not invited to Lambeth or that either of us declined to go. Among the events in Canterbury is one organised by the Churches&#146; Network for Non-violence, which campaigns for an end to violence against children throughout the world and to whose work I am delighted to pay tribute.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1664"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1664</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80722-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08072254000172"></a>The conference gives us the chance to reflect on the violence of our world, as we pray alongside bishops from Zimbabwe and the Sudan, for example&#151;as we speak with them, eat with them and share with them. People at the conference speak time and again of how easily violence becomes part of a culture in our contemporary world, becomes endemic in a society.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08072254000173"></a>We are not immune to that danger. We need to affirm that violence needs to be outlawed in all circumstances in our society, not least within the narrow world of the STCs, which we are talking about today. There needs to be a greater determination to do away with those restraint techniques which are or could become violent and to stress the importance&#151;which has hardly been mentioned here, but which I hope the Minister will talk about&#151;of relationships of personal care between staff and children. If the quotations in the committee&#146;s report from the training manual about techniques of &#147;hair grab&#148;, &#147;strangle against the wall&#148; or &#147;kicks on the floor&#148; are accurate, they are alarming. I hope that the Minister will be able to speak of positive moves towards better relationships in STCs and to an ending of such practices.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08072254000175"></a>I am somewhat puzzled that the Ministry of Justice is not dealing with this issue. The Minister was in the Chamber earlier. I recognise the locus of the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, in this matter, given that the Department for Children, Schools and Families is involved in the treatment of young people&#151;I am sure that the noble Lord will give us a most excellent expos&#233; of what the Government are doing&#151;but one would have expected the relevant ministry, the ministry to which we address our scrutiny in our Questions on a regular basis, to deal with the issue. It is the ministry that dealt with the Joint Committee on Human Rights; it is the lead ministry; and it is the one that issues the guidance. It is extraordinary that it has chosen not to be involved. At this stage, we are carrying out parliamentary scrutiny of one sort or another.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08072254000176"></a>We are also aware that the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Children, Schools and Families have agreed a joint review of the situation&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, mentioned that. I re-emphasise his question. The review was due to report on 4 April this year. As far as we are aware, we have not been shown the findings of the review, nor have we seen the Government's response. Can the Minister tell us when we can expect to see that?</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08072254000177"></a>I turn to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I should say that I was a member of the committee when the previous report on deaths in custody was produced&#151;I believe that it was during the 2004-05 Session. We brought up some of the issues that arise in this report. Some years have now passed, but I fear that we do not see much movement.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08072254000178"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said that the Government&#146;s response came out on Thursday 17 July. The noble Lord may naturally seek to be kinder in his comments to the Minister than I might be from the other side of the Chamber. If it came out on Thursday 17 July, I should say that some of us have been abroad. I came back last night, and the only opportunity that I have had to read the Government&#146;s response has been this morning. The way in which the debate is treated is indicative of the importance given to this issue.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08072254000179"></a>The report is eminently sensible. It recognises the difficulties involved on all sides. We accept that the trainees&#151;the young people who are detained&#151;and the staff have to maintain a level of order whereby these young people can be detained for the prescribed period in the best possible way. I think people on all sides accept that there must be an element of pragmatism. The committee, however, seeks to influence the Government&#146;s report in several significant ways. That is what it is there for. We on these Benches agree wholeheartedly with its conclusions and its criticisms, and we were disappointed&#151;briefly, as I scanned it&#151;with the Government&#146;s response to it.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08072254000180"></a>First, the order to extend the scope of the use of restraint was passed without parliamentary debate. We are told that it is a statutory instrument and so cannot be subject parliamentary debate, and that that is how the system works. That is all very well, but an order that broadens so widely the application of restraint&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, commented on what it does in practical terms and I will not take up any more time discussing it&#151;passes without debate, and the Government&#146;s response is that they do not believe they should answer the question about the provision&#146;s compatibility with the Human Rights Act or provide any scope for consultation. I would have expected the Explanatory Notes, as did the committee in its report, to cover whether this new expansion of powers was compatible with the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08072254000181"></a>Let me go further. We know that, historically, black and ethnic minority young people are subjected to restraint in larger numbers than their white counterparts. According to the Howard League for Penal Reform, prison monitoring shows that restraint is used disproportionately on young black men. Will the Minister say whether the Ministry of Justice will give us a broader view of whether the expansion of powers is compatible with human rights? The Ministry of Justice also needs to carry out a race impact assessment when members of a particular population within the secure training estate are affected in higher numbers than their white counterparts. We need to know why this is happening.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08072254000182"></a>Still on the theme of scrutiny, will the Minister say whether he will take up the committee&#146;s recommendation that every six months the Ministry of Justice should provide Parliament with figures on the use of restraint? If the answer is yes, will he say when we can expect the latest set of figures to be released? The report was published in April, so I would expect that by the time we return after the Summer Recess we might have sight of some figures to know whether the expansion of powers has resulted in a decrease, increase or whatever in the use of restraint for maintaining order.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08072254000183"></a>The general tone of the Government&#146;s response to the JCHR&#146;s scrutiny is incomprehension that expanding the use of restraint should trouble anyone. Perhaps the absence of a Minister is proof of the priority given to this debate; this is not a high-order issue. The incredulity extends to all sorts of legal contortions that we are presented with, such as why UK ratification of the convention matters, but not the inspector&#146;s comments. In other words, the findings of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child are dismissed because its conclusions are not narrowly, legally binding. Another legal contortion is the definition of violence. I pay tribute to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds who spoke so passionately about these distinctions and how one perceives violence in legal terms, the exact legal definition of the use of force, and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08072254000184"></a>In the Government&#146;s eyes, violence is the &#147;unlawful or unjustifiable&#148; use of force, which is the narrowest possible definition that one might imagine. People who speak plain English might not think of that definition when they encounter the word &#147;violence&#148;. I looked up &#147;violence&#148; in my college dictionary, which is excessively detailed and academic. The most commonly understood meaning is &#147;swift and intense force&#148;. The next most common definition is,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000334"></a>&#147;rough or injurious physical force, action or treatment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000304"></a>It is only at a third tier of usage where violence is an,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000335"></a>&#147;unjust or unwarranted exertion of force or power&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000305"></a>I labour that point because, if you are a young person at the receiving end of violence or force&#151;call it what you will&#151;that causes you intense physical pain and discomfort, not to mention the psychological humiliation that no doubt will follow and be alongside that, it matters little that the state, in its wisdom, defines violence in a different way from how you see it. That is evidenced in the suicide note and the testimony given by Adam Rickwood, who, as we know, tragically took his own life.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08072254000185"></a>Finally, I come to the comments made by the Minister in his testimony to the committee. He referred to:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08072254000317"></a>&#147;The important balance to be struck between competing rights&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000306"></a>We hear that all the time. In the terrorism legislation, we are hearing about the importance of the balance that needs to be struck between security and liberty. I would argue that to imply a balance is to suggest that there is a trade-off in terms of a scale, a measurement, and that there might be a little more or a little less here or there.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08072254000186"></a>On the use of violence by the state against its own young people, to imply a balance is to approach the problem from the wrong philosophical mindset. It is not a balance. The state has a duty to be extremely careful in its dealings with these people. There should be overt, explicit, transparent commitments that the agents of the state will not use violence against children except in highly and extraordinarily well defined circumstances.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08072254000187"></a>There is little left to be said other than that the extension of these powers in this manner, without adequate consultation and scrutiny, is wrong. It was wrong when it was dealt with then. But, furthermore,  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1667"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1667</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the way in which it was dealt in response to the Joint Committee of Human Rights report and findings, and the Government&#146;s response, was wrong. I shall conclude by quoting the opening paragraph of the conclusions of the committee&#146;s report, which says it all. We would wish to see that reflected in the way the Government deals with it. The report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08072254000318"></a>&#147;The state has a duty to ensure that detained young people and STC staff are protected from abuse or violence. It is therefore incumbent on the state to take positive steps to ensure that detainees and staff are not injured by other detainees, and conversely that detainees are not injured by staff ... We are dissatisfied by the Minister&#146;s explanation of how current policy and practice comply with human rights standards&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000307"></a>I hope that the Minister responding today will not leave us in that state of frustration.</p>

If my reply is on the short side, it is only because I share so much of the sentiments articulated by the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner. This is a very sensitive and sometimes distressing area of the criminal justice system, but that is all the more reason why we should deal with it in a careful and thoughtful way.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08072254000189"></a>The Joint Committee has produced its report, which can be added to the growing list of reports that have dealt with youth justice. Of course, we have the anchor document of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, in his inquiry on behalf of the Howard League and I share the concern of several noble Lords that we await the very long delayed government response to that. That inquiry, and the subsequent rule changes, followed the death of a young man, Gareth Wyatt, in circumstances involving the use of restraint. This important area deserves the full attention all of us in Parliament, because failure can have such tragic consequences.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08072254000190"></a>We have been reminded that secure training centres were set up to accommodate young offenders between the ages of 12 and 17 who were too young or too vulnerable to be in young offender institutions run by the Prison Service. As ever, a fine balance must be struck. It is a sad reality that staff in secure training centres are sometimes confronted with a risk or threat of violence from those whom they are charged to oversee, which always must be borne in mind when criticising the service. They are compelled to maintain a certain standard of behaviour and discipline among a group of offenders, who in many cases are very disturbed characters</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08072254000191"></a>On the secure training centres, it is a salutary thought that England and Wales&#151;Scotland is excluded because it does not have secure training centres&#151;is just about the only jurisdiction in Europe which employs restraint by force in this way. The staff in these centres are, by and large, underpaid and, even more seriously, under-trained. It is the view of bodies such as the Howard League that restraint should be used only in exceptional circumstances where all else has failed and that there should be an on-the-spot inquiry after each incident.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08072254000192"></a>One of the more radical suggestions in the report from the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, was that the child&#151;I emphasise the word &#147;child&#148;, although the Government persist in calling them trainees&#151;should be involved in  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1668"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1668</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the inquiry. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds referred to that when he talked about restitution. I also share the concern that the guidelines for the use of restraint are not published. I shall be very interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to that. Obviously, with the volume of occasions on which restraint is customarily used, it is not possible to implement suggestions that there should be an inquiry every time.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08072254000193"></a>The committee was extremely critical of the Government&#146;s attitude to the report. It contended that the Minister appeared to distinguish between the use of force or restraint and the application of violence, which has been the subject around the House today. It pointed out that no such distinction features in human rights law and, while the Government do not sanction violence against children, that is exactly what current legislation permits. The committee found that the Government suggested in their response that they are not obliged to comply with the general comments of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, but simply with the convention. That is not satisfactory. It is messy. Strictly speaking that it is true, but it ill behoves this country to be seen to be complying with our obligations so grudgingly. We should be concerned about applying the most rigorous standards, not about getting away with the barest minimum. I hope that the Minister will feel able to expand on that point.</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08072254000194"></a>The committee also raised concerns about the use of the term,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000336"></a>&#147;to ensure good order and discipline&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000308"></a>in the rules. This term appeared in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, it was absent from the 1998 rules, but has made a reappearance in the 2007 rules. The Joint Committee criticised this phrase as,</p>
<ul><a name="08072254000337"></a>&#147;imprecise, over-broad and inherently subjective&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000309"></a>and its view will increase confusion rather than clarify what is allowed. Can the Minister explain why that term was not considered appropriate to be included in the 1998 rules? If the Government are so sure that it is now necessary, I hope that they will take careful note of the committee&#146;s comments. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister exactly what he proposes to do about that. I want also to ask him whether the circumstances in any of the four training centres since the rules came into force have required the restraint to be used to maintain &#147;good order and discipline&#148;. If so, how many times? Is he in a position to tell the House whether these situations could have been properly resolved under the pre-2007 rules?</p>

<a name="80722-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08072254000195"></a>I end by quoting the further observations of the committee in referring to the phrase &#147;good order and discipline&#148;:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08072254000319"></a>&#147;Far from achieving clarity about the circumstances in which physical restraint can be used on a child, as recommended by the coroner in the Rickwood case, instead it brings confusion&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000310"></a>I shall be very interested to hear the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>

<a name="08072254000196"></a><a name="80722-0005.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80722-0005.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08072254000462"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Lord Adonis):</b> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Dubs made a powerful speech in which he drew the House&#146;s attention to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the use of restraint in secure training centres.  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1669"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1669</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We have also had compelling contributions about non-violence, relationship building and human rights from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman. We appreciate the good wishes of the Anglican Bishops deliberating in Canterbury at the present time. We reciprocate those good wishes, as the participants appear to have challenges at least as great as those that this House faces in reaching decisions on delicate matters.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08072254000197"></a>As the noble Viscount rightly said, this is a sensitive and often distressing area of policy. I recognise unreservedly the duty of care that the state owes to those in its custody. A number of key issues are raised in the Joint Committee&#146;s report: the principles of human rights; the amendment rules made last year; the mechanisms in place for ensuring that restraint is used lawfully, and their review; and effective staff training. In addressing these issues I also want to emphasise the critical priority, which my department recognises, of promoting good education in all the institutions of the secure estate for children and young people so that they can make the best of their lives after they leave.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08072254000198"></a>I state categorically at the outset that the techniques of restraint should be used strictly as a last resort and never as a punishment. That is a fundamental principle enshrined in the Youth Justice Board&#146;s code of practice, <I>Managing Children and Young People&#146;s Behaviour in the Secure Estate</I>. However, the behaviour of some young people in custody is frequently challenging and can be dangerous. It is important that staff who work with and care for these young people are able to intervene appropriately in situations where there is a threat to personal safety or where the safety of the establishment is put at risk.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08072254000199"></a>To establish and maintain a safe environment, it is essential that custody officers are able to defuse potentially dangerous situations. This can be done without recourse to physical intervention in most situations, but, alas, not always, and sometimes other means will be simply impossible. In these situations it is imperative that officers have the right to intervene and establish order. Ensuring the physical safety of everyone involved in the custodial system for young people is the overriding responsibility of Parliament, the Government and all the public officers involved.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08072254000200"></a>The issue at the centre of this debate is what actions and what circumstances constitute acceptable intervention and what oversteps the line. The use of force becomes violence if it is used in an inappropriate way, either through being excessive or through being applied in a situation that is not appropriate. It is therefore critical that custody officers have a clear understanding of when and how they should intervene to maintain safety and security. That is why we asked Peter Smallridge and Andrew Wilkinson to conduct an independent review.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08072254000201"></a>Secure training centres must take account of the human rights of the trainees in their care. The requirement to comply with the Human Rights Act 1998 is explicitly mentioned in their contracts and all operators are aware of their obligations under the Act. The Youth Justice Board keeps in close touch with directors about matters relating to human rights and the welfare of  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1670"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1670</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>young people at the centres. The United Kingdom is committed to meeting its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and pays due attention to the opinions and guidance of the UN committee. However, the committee is not a judicial body and we need to have regard to the wording of the convention as it is ratified. We are confident that our understanding of the convention is correct.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08072254000202"></a>When discussing the use of physical restraint there needs to be a balance between the rights of a young person whose behaviour is dangerous to others, or to the security of the institution, and the rights of those affected by that behaviour. In deciding what is acceptable, we have to have a proper recognition of the rights of all those involved. The Joint Committee&#146;s report placed emphasis on the Secure Training Centre (Amendment) Rules 2007, which added the need to maintain &#147;good order and discipline&#148; as one of the purposes for which the use of restraint is permitted. Good order and discipline is central to the running of secure training centres and of any other establishment where young people are accommodated. The primary legislation that created secure training centres, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, makes ensuring good order and discipline one of the four duties of custody officers. It goes on to specify that to fulfil their duties correctly, custody officers shall have the power to use force &#147;where necessary&#148;.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08072254000203"></a>&#147;Good order and discipline&#148; is not an ambiguous term to give custody officers carte blanche to use force. The Government recognise the importance of ensuring that physical restraint is used as sparingly as possible. The code of practice, <I>Managing Children and Young People&#146;s Behaviour in the Secure Estate</I>, states that restrictive physical interventions must not be used as a punishment or merely to secure compliance with staff instructions. They must only be used to counter behaviour that puts the safe running of the establishment at risk and then only as a last resort when no alternative is available or other options have been exhausted.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08072254000204"></a>My noble friend cited the reference in the Joint Committee&#146;s report to the example of a collective refusal by young people to go to bed at the appointed time when asked to do so, a situation where there appeared to be no immediate threat of violence. I would not wish to make an armchair judgment about the correctness of a particular decision to use physical restraint without an understanding of all the circumstances in which it was made. However, it is important that we are clear about what in principle is appropriate or inappropriate. I say without qualification that a decision to use restraint simply to ensure immediate compliance with an instruction to go to bed would be in breach of the code of practice. Section 10.4 of the code is clear on this point:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08072254000320"></a>&#147;Restrictive physical interventions must not be used as a punishment or merely to secure compliance with staff instructions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000311"></a>However, if the situation was such that a continuing refusal to go to bed puts the facility at risk because of, for example, the loss of control by staff, then minimum necessary physical intervention might be appropriate under Section 10.5 of the code, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08072254000321"></a>&#147;Any intervention must be in compliance with the relevant rules and regulations for the establishment, and carried out in accordance with methods in which the member of staff has received training&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1671"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1671</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80722-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08072254000205"></a>I turn now to the amendment rules themselves. There was no formal consultation, but before introducing the amendment rules the Government took into consideration the views of all the various interest groups. We consulted key stakeholders, the Youth Justice Board and the operators of secure training centres, and were well informed of the views of other commentators. Furthermore, contrary to what I thought my noble friend said, the amendment rules were fully debated by your Lordships when they were made. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, prayed against the Secure Training Centre (Amendment) Rules 2007 on 18 July last year, and a long debate ensued during which many of these points were thoroughly debated and addressed by my noble friend Lord Hunt.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08072254000206"></a>The effect of the rule amendment has been made clear to all those concerned. When the rule change was introduced, instructors at the Prison Service&#146;s Control and Restraint Centre&#151;now the National Tactical Response Group&#151;informed local instructors of the new legal position, new manuals were issued to all instructors and the change was covered in the training of new staff and refresher training for existing staff. We said at the time of the rule change that we did not expect it to lead to greater use of restraint, and it has not done so. The rules came into effect in July 2007 and since then the trend has been downwards.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08072254000207"></a>The noble Baroness and my noble friend asked about further information on the use of restraint. Statistics collected by the Youth Justice Board on the use of restraint in secure training centres and other secure establishments for young people in custody are regularly provided in response to Questions in this House and in another place. However, the Youth Justice Board intends in future to publish annual statistics on the use of restraint, the first of which will be published later this year.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08072254000208"></a>We are looking at the whole issue in the light of the recommendations of the joint review of restraint, which we are currently considering. My noble friend asked when we will publish that review. We plan to publish it and the Government&#146;s response together by the end of October; so it will be freely available to the House to consider in due course.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08072254000209"></a>I turn next to the framework of supervision. We need to ensure that the system of restraint is not abused. There are many mechanisms in place to ensure that the use of restraint is lawful and ethical. On a national level, we have established the Physical Control in Care Management Board to drive forward improvements and safety measures. The board oversees all the processes for ensuring the safety of physical control in care and will address any new issues that arise. On a local level, every secure training centre has a monitor whose duty is to review the running of the centre and to report to the Secretary of State any allegations against custody officers.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08072254000210"></a>All centres have mechanisms to ensure that staff understand when physical control in care may and may not be used. All custody staff must complete a four-day PCC course before qualification. The course covers the legal requirements relating to the use of restraint as well as health and safety considerations. The Youth Justice Board&#146;s contract with STC providers  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1672"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1672</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requires them to give refresher training to each staff member every 12 months. In addition, all staff are provided with written guidance when they join the centre which sets out the policies and procedures in relation to the use and recording of restraint.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08072254000211"></a>Following any incident of restraint, a report must be prepared within 24 hours and considered by senior managers. Monthly management meetings review all physical control in care incidents and there is a complaints procedure if a young person feels that force has been misapplied or used inappropriately. The Independent Advocacy Service assists young people who wish to make a complaint.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08072254000212"></a>The Youth Justice Board is continually seeking to develop and reinforce these mechanisms to maximise the safety of young people and staff at secure training centres. It is a central tenet of government policy on secure training centres that every trainee who has had to be restrained is able to discuss the incident afterwards. The code of practice to which I referred earlier states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08072254000322"></a>&#147;After the intervention, the child or young person must have the opportunity to debrief with a suitable member of staff, with the support of an advocate if requested&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000312"></a>However, a written statement by the trainee is not always the best option. The Youth Justice Board is exploring further with the secure training centres how young people&#146;s views can be best taken into account.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08072254000213"></a>Physical control in care training includes sessions on determining whether the use of force is necessary and proportionate. If a centre&#146;s operating procedures are not clear or appropriate, the Youth Justice Board can amend or reject them before they come into effect. Monitoring arrangements provide for the Youth Justice Board to determine whether a centre has robust mechanisms in place to review its operating procedures and to check that they are being adhered to. Physical control in care is discussed with the young person on arrival at the centre and covered in the induction process. If a young person has to be physically restrained, staff explain why it was necessary and examine strategies to avoid a repetition. The STC&#146;s statement of purpose and function&#151;which describes when PCC is used, how it fits in with the STC&#146;s wider behaviour management strategy, how incidents are documented and how they are reviewed&#151;is available to parents and carers. Copies can be sent on request or it can be viewed at the centre itself.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08072254000214"></a>The Government are seeking constantly to ensure that the system is as good as it can be by reviewing practice. The Youth Justice Board has convened expert medical panels in 2004-05 and 2007-08 to examine the safety of the restraint techniques approved for use in secure training centres. The use of three techniques, including the nose distraction technique mentioned by my noble friend, has been suspended following recommendations by the panel. Last year we set up an independent joint review of restraint in juvenile secure settings to look at all aspects of restraint in the under-18 secure estate. Its terms of reference included looking at the restraint techniques used, staff training related to restraint, cross-departmental knowledge sharing and the systems for monitoring and recording incidents of restraint, including injuries and warning signs exhibited after restraint. As I said a moment ago, we will respond in full to the report by the end of October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08072254000215"></a>The Government and the Youth Justice Board have prepared and published an action plan setting out what we have done and are doing in response to the detailed recommendations of the coroners who presided at the inquests into Gareth Myatt&#146;s and Adam Rickwood&#146;s deaths.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08072254000216"></a>As the noble Viscount rightly said, training is crucial to effective practice in this area. A system is in place for the ongoing training of staff. The contracts for secure training centres stipulate:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08072254000323"></a>&#147;Staff required to use Physical Restraint on a Trainee in custody at the Secure Training Centre or to instruct others in its use must be appropriately trained by accredited instructors approved by the Authority&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08072254000313"></a>They also state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08072254000324"></a>&#147;Refresher training on the use of Physical Restraint at the Secure Training Centre will be given at regular intervals&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80722-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08072254000217"></a>All training issues are now overseen by the Physical Control in Care Management Board. The system of staff training is to be enhanced by regular audits by national instructors to give assurance that training is being delivered correctly. The board will further consider training issues, including the content of the physical control in care manual, in the light of the findings of the joint review of restraint. The manual is revised and updated following review by the expert medical review panel and otherwise as circumstances require. We intend to conduct a full review of the manual having considered the findings of the joint review of restraint, and in doing so we will take account of the Joint Committee&#146;s comments. The manual has already been updated to remove references to the two techniques&#151;the double basket hold and the nose distraction technique&#151;that were suspended in response to the concerns of the most recent medical panel.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08072254000218"></a>The noble Viscount and my noble friend asked about publication of the manual. Although part of the manual is already published, the actual techniques are not published as they might be attempted by untrained people and that would put others at risk. We believe that that is a sound judgment on the balance between what should be published in the manual and what should be withheld.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08072254000219"></a>The Joint Committee&#146;s report calls for stopping the use of distraction techniques completely. We have suspended, as I say, the nose distraction technique on the advice of the independent medical panel. Distraction techniques are for use in situations where, if they were not available, there would be no means of applying the normal restraint holds and bringing an incident under control. They involve a momentary pain which will distract a person long enough for an officer to intervene safely. The use of distraction techniques is one of the issues considered by the joint review of restraint and, as I say, we will have more to say about it by the end of October.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08072254000220"></a>In conclusion, the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights has highlighted a number of concerns.</p>

Had I been aware, I would myself have sent it to her earlier. Unfortunately, I cannot undertake that government responses will be sent in every individual case, but it is my own normal practice as a Minister to see that noble Lords are fully aware of relevant government documents. If she feels that there was a lack of courtesy in our provision of information to her in this case, I apologise for that.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08072254000225"></a>In conclusion, the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights has highlighted a number of concerns and made a number of recommendations. Many of those have been taken on board by the Government, and we will have more to say in due course. We must not forget, however, that not only do we have to protect the physical safety of all those who live and work at custodial institutions, but we must protect the safety of the environment at such institutions to ensure that we give all young people in custody the best chance to live normal lives once they come out of the system.</p>

<a name="80722-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08072254000226"></a>The Government take this responsibility very seriously. We have introduced a number of measures to ensure that inappropriate techniques are not used to restrain young people, that staff have sufficient training to use restraint appropriately and that the system is under constant review. Like noble Lords who have spoken in this debate, I wish to see the custodial system serve those who pass through it as best it can. We believe that all the measures that have been put in place and our ongoing review will help to improve the system of youth justice to the benefit of all those concerned.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Mr Speaker, with permission, and following my visit last weekend to Baghdad and Basra, I would like to update the House on the latest developments in Iraq.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Let me start by paying tribute to the British service men and women who have served there with distinction since March 2003 and in particular to those who have given their lives in service of their country. I know the whole House will join with me in honouring the memory of the fallen and saluting the courage of all our military and our civilian personnel.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;As I set out in my October Statement, our objective is the creation of an independent, prosperous, democratic Iraq that is free of terrorist violence, secure within its borders and a stable presence in the region&#151;something that is firmly in Britain&#146;s interests, and in the interests of the world as a whole.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;To achieve this, we have sought with America and our other allies to support the Iraqi Government as they take on greater responsibility for their security and for safeguarding their new democracy, challenging those, whether terrorists, insurgents or militia, who threaten their citizens and undermine the rule of law. We have also sought to foster democratic and accountable government and support national reconciliation, giving all of Iraq&#146;s communities a genuine say in the future of their country. And we have worked to help the Iraqis build their economy and give their people an economic stake in the future.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In the last year, this has led us to pursue the strategy of &#145;overwatch&#146;, moving from combat to the training and mentoring of the Iraqi forces and the Iraqi police, encouraging the development of local government and working with the Iraqis on a Basra economic development strategy.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;And in recent months, conditions in Basra have shown a marked improvement. Incidents of indirect fire against British troops in the Basra air station have fallen from 200 a month at their peak last summer to an average of fewer than five a month since April this year. As the All-Party House of Commons Defence Committee says in its report today, the security situation in Basra has been &#145;transformed&#146;. And, as General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker confirmed to me at the weekend,  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1676"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1676</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thanks to operations by Iraqi and coalition security forces that are strongly welcomed by ordinary Iraqis, violent incidents right across Iraq are at their lowest level since 2004. Sunni groups have now joined the Iraqi and American forces in driving al-Qaeda from areas where it had been able to terrorise the population, and Iraqi troops, with British and American support, have had success against the illegal Shia militias, giving the Government of Iraq more control of the country.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Of course this progress, often fragile, cannot be taken for granted. Millions of Iraqis are still refugees, either inside Iraq or in other countries. And the two car bombs detonated at the gates of an Iraqi army recruitment centre on 15 July remind us that there are groups still determined to inflict violence.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;But the most important development is that the improvements we have seen have been increasingly Iraqi-led. Security responsibility for 10 of 18 provinces has now transferred to Iraqi control, including all four provinces in Britain&#146;s area of operations. The Iraqi security forces are now taking the lead in maintaining security and confronting all those who perpetrate violence, including acting decisively against Shia militia in Basra, Sadr City and Al Amara. And they have been supported by local people from across Iraq&#146;s communities, Sunni, Shia and Kurd.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Britain has already helped train more than 20,000 Iraqi army troops. But I want to pay credit to Prime Minister Maliki, his Government and the Iraqi security forces who have shown bravery and leadership in tackling the terrorists and militias threatening the stability of their country.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The improved security situation has provided a platform for further essential progress on reconciliation. And we have seen not only increased co-operation between Sunni communities and the Iraqi Government in areas like Anbar and Mosul and the return of the Tawafuq Sunni party to the Government, but the passage of key legislation that is helping to embed democracy, including the accountability and justice law, the provincial powers law and the 2008 budget.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The next stage will be provincial elections, reinforcing the political progress being made at the national level. And our message to the leaders of all Iraq&#146;s communities and parties right across the country is that they must continue to make the right long-term decisions to achieve a sustainable peace.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;It is also important that, as we move forward, we see Iraq&#146;s neighbours playing a constructive and responsible role in Iraq&#146;s future. In particular, Syria should clamp down on the movement of foreign fighters and Iran must stop the provision of arms and training to those who attack the democratically elected Government of Iraq, the coalition forces in Iraq at that Government&#146;s request, and the Iraqi people.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We will also continue to focus on helping the Iraqi Government rebuild their economy and ensuring the Iraqi people have a stake in their future. British-led projects in southern Iraq have already helped deliver enough electricity to supply 800,000 people and water supply for more than 1 million people, with this year another 120,000 people due to get power  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1677"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1677</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and 250,000 gain access to direct supplies of water. Our funding has helped the UN and World Bank repair and re-equip 1,000 healthcare centres and more than 5,000 schools, and train nearly 150,000 teachers. With British training and equipment, including upgrades to air traffic control systems, lighting and firefighting capability, Iraqi personnel are now regularly handling more than 20 civil flights a week at Basra international airport. And British mentoring and support has helped the Basra provincial council gain access to $400 million in central government funds for 2008&#151;money that, in line with the council&#146;s increasing ability to take the lead itself, it is now spending to further improve infrastructure and provide public services such as power, water, health and education.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Last week, the Basra Development Commission agreed an outline economic strategy for Basra that sets out plans to encourage private sector and foreign investment. Britain is supporting the new Basra Investment Promotion Agency, which I met at the weekend, and the Basra Development Fund, which will provide loans to small and start-up businesses&#151;key drivers of economic growth and job creation. I am grateful for the work of Michael Wareing, a leading British businessman, who co-chairs the Basra Development Commission.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Nine months ago, I set out the key elements of our strategy for handing over security in Basra to the Iraqis and set out the stages for completing the tasks we have set ourselves. We completed the initial phase on target, handing over Basra to provincial Iraqi control in December. This allowed us to reduce troop numbers in southern Iraq from 5,500 in September to 4,500.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;After the Iraqi Government launched Operation Charge of the Knights to enforce the rule of law in Basra, as my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary explained to the House in April, the military advice was that we should pause the further planned reduction so that British troops, together with US forces, could support the Iraqis in this crucial operation. Since then, we have responded to changing needs and embedded more than 800 UK personnel within the Iraqi command structure, at divisional, brigade and battalion level. The focus of the 4,100 UK forces still in southern Iraq is now on completing the task of training and mentoring the 14th Division of the Iraqi army in Basra. It is right that as we do so, we continue for the next few months to provide support at these levels.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Other remaining military tasks, agreed with the Government of Iraq and in close consultation with our US allies, include finalising the preparation of Basra airport for transfer to Iraqi control and continuing to develop the capacity of the Iraqi navy and marines so they can protect Iraq's oil platforms, territorial waters and Umm Qasr port&#151;all critical to Iraq's economic future. It is now right to complete the tasks we have set ourselves.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We expect the Basra Development Commission to publish its detailed economic development plan in the autumn. We hope that local government  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1678"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column 1678</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>elections will take place by the end of 2008. Subject to security conditions on the ground, our military commanders believe that the Iraqis will be able to take over development of Basra airport by the end of this year. They also expect the first stage of the general training and mentoring of the combat troops of the 14th Division in Basra to be complete around the turn of the year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;As the focus shifts from training combat troops, we will then move forward to the specific task of mentoring headquarter and specialist staffs. Our military commanders expect the 14th Division in Basra to be fully trained during the first months of next year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;As we complete these tasks, and as progress continues across these different areas, we will continue to reduce the number of British troops in Iraq. Of course, future decisions will be based, as I have always said, on the advice of our military commanders on the ground. But I can tell the House today that just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch, we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009 as we make the transition to a long-term bilateral partnership with Iraq, similar to the normal relationships which our military forces have with other important countries in the region.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Defence Secretary and our military commanders will now work with the Iraqi Government to formulate agreement on the details of such a partnership, including the necessary legal basis, and he will report to the House in the autumn.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I believe it is right that having successfully trained and mentored large numbers of the Iraqi forces, and having successfully worked with the Iraqis on a new economic development strategy, we complete the key tasks we have agreed with the Iraqi Government: training the 14th Division of the Iraqi army in Basra; preparing Basra airport for transfer to Iraqi control; pushing forward economic development; providing the necessary support for provincial elections; honouring our obligations to the Iraqi people; and, at all times, ensuring the safety of our Armed Forces, whose professionalism and dedication have brought us to this stage and whose service to our country I once again commend to the House&#148;.</p>

Week after week, Parliament hears the litany of brave young men and women who have laid down their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. We cannot fully express our gratitude to them or our admiration for the skill and fortitude of our troops in their varied and often changing missions in this troubled region. So many of the aspirations and enmities causing the multi-layered and overlapping tensions in this region are centuries old. I wonder whether we are any nearer a solution now.

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08072254000235"></a>It is clear that Iraq must be restored to being a great nation, a pivot of regional affairs&#151;a nation that with security and stability could and should be one of the richest in the world. But while we welcome the Prime Minister&#146;s assessment that President Bush&#146;s troop surge has been a success, there is still far to go.</p>

<a name="80722-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08072254000236"></a>As the Prime Minister says, Iraqi army and security forces are now performing better and the Statement promises further progress in Basra, but what prospect have we that in Basra a woman may walk without a veil and go without fear? What hope is there of accelerating economic reconstruction, including even faster progress than reported to the provision of basic amenities such as reliable electricity and clean water?</p>

<a name="80722-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08072254000237"></a>While there are improvements in security in Basra city, can the noble Baroness confirm that the provisional reconstruction team is still based at the airbase? What prospect is there of a move to Basra proper, and have the circumstances for a move been clearly defined?</p>

<a name="80722-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08072254000238"></a>I welcome the fact that this time the Prime Minister has not made the error of grandstanding in Iraq on reducing troop numbers&#151;a soundbite never properly fulfilled, to the detriment of his own political reputation and force morale. What is the policy on troop reductions? Everyone wants to see our forces out of Iraq as soon as it is practicable to do so; but is not the right approach, which we have advocated and the Government now seem to be adopting, to lay out conditions which have to be met, to achieve the objectives we set ourselves and, only then, withdraw the troops? Does the noble Baroness accept that there should be no more artificial timetables, as the Prime Minister said only on 19 July? Will she assure the House that no private undertakings have been given to either US presidential candidate? We have been there before, my Lords. Good personal relations with a US president are one thing, British national interests sometimes another.</p>

<a name="80722-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08072254000239"></a>What is our reaction to the call from the Iraqi Government that all US combat forces, and so, presumably, all UK troops, should be withdrawn from Iraq by the end of 2010?</p>

<a name="80722-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08072254000240"></a>What is to be done about the 2 million refugees who have fled Iraq in recent years? What discussions have taken place about their future? Does the noble Baroness agree that the long-term stability and prosperity of Iraq depend upon their eventual resettlement? Will she assure the House that there will be fair, honourable and dignified treatment for those brave Iraqis who helped our forces as interpreters and in so many other ways? Some noble Lords may have seen reports of the squalid and demeaning conditions in which some of these families are living. Can the noble Baroness tell us how many families have been transferred here? Will she assure the House that they will not be placed in accommodation in the UK that no one else will accept? Such action would shame our country.</p>

It is, and will be, a regional superpower. It must be treated with subtlety and respect. If it feels threatened, it will claim the right to defend itself and, of course, security runs two ways. That said, Iran has a duty to behave with responsibility. Its outrageous threats to

Its sponsorship of Hezbollah and Hamas in encircling Israel is equally threatening to Israel. That is no route to justice for the Palestinian people. What engagement, if any, is there with the revolutionary Hamas regime in Gaza, and can the noble Baroness confirm that Hezbollah now has an effective military, political and constitutional block on the Government of the Lebanon and any action by them? What is being done there? After all, France has the EU presidency; it has a historic link with Lebanon. What is President Sarkozy doing to help the matter?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08072254000242"></a>What did the Prime Minister mean when he said that Iran would not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons? It is, of course, a nightmare prospect, and something that we must all strive to avoid, but what are the Government&#146;s plans? Will there be sanctions? If so, what, where, when, and enforced by whom? What are the implications for the security of British forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, within range of Iranian reprisal? How can Russia and China be brought, as they must, into the resolution of these issues? Does it need a fresh start? When will we know whether Mr Blair&#146;s mission served whatever credible or useful purpose it may once have had?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08072254000243"></a>It would be tempting to ask about Afghanistan, for the issues are linked and the impact on the desperate overstretch of our troops enormous, but I shall ask only this. We are hearing new voices from Washington talking of potentially pursuing al-Qaeda into Pakistan, whether the Pakistan Government agree or not. What is the UK Government&#146;s view on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08072254000244"></a>As we leave Westminster for pleasant places, families up and down the land keep a watch on photographs of loved ones far away, doing dangerous duty for our country. Across the Middle East, millions yearn for a peace that is so elusive and for leadership ready to take the risks that will break the mould of poverty, hatred and the gun. In the weeks ahead, we should not forget any of them. The prize for success would be immense, but the costs of lack of care and clarity in our objectives are incalculable. As our nation, with its long experience, already knows, none would be spared the pain. Whatever options are charted out in the months ahead, populist disengagement, politically, diplomatically, or even militarily, is not now among them.</p>

It is as a result of allied activities, which have destroyed so much of Iraq&#146;s infrastructure, that these operations are necessary now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08072254000247"></a>We also think it disappointing that no further timetable is given in the Statement for withdrawal or even an estimate of when our training role will end. What is the number of troops at Basra airport? Will they be brought back to the United Kingdom or serve elsewhere in Iraq when we hand over at the end of the year? The remaining handovers, which are scheduled to happen by the end of the year, will surely result in a predictable number of reductions of troops in Iraq. The noble Baroness could have given us some indication of what those numbers would be. It is very unsettling for the troops serving in the theatre not to have any idea of how long they will remain there and when their term of office will end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08072254000248"></a>The Statement contains references to the foreign militants crossing the border from Syria. Do we have any knowledge of who is organising and funding them? In our discussions with the Syrian Government, have we made any progress towards halting the operations and getting at the sources of their training and funding? Similarly, with Iran, what representations have we made to Tehran and what response have we had on the army and the training of terrorists? The reduction in the number of attacks on British personnel in Basra is an indication of some success in persuading both Syria and Iran not to engage in these operations, but is it not also a product of better political relations between the Sunni and Shia factions in Iraq? We do not hear anything these days about the Mahdi Army. Does that mean that it has been incorporated in the political process? I certainly hope so.</p>

<a name="80722-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08072254000249"></a>The Statement refers to al-Qaeda and gradually overcoming its forces. Is that meant to be a generic label or does it imply that there is some unification of the command structures among the militants still operating in southern Iraq?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08072254000250"></a>The Statement says nothing about Afghanistan, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde.

Both noble Lords asked about troop reductions; we have been clear that any proposals to reduce troops would have to be on the basis of intelligence at the time and what was being told to us by the military command at what was thought to be the most appropriate moment. It is important, with my right honourable friend bringing the Statement to another place and me bringing it to your Lordships&#146; House, that we keep this House up to date with the current thinking and that noble Lords are able to see the progress that is made. But we will not put artificial timetables on it; any timetables that are put will always have the conditionality that circumstances must allow for them.</p>

<a name="80722-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08072254000254"></a>We look forward to the bilateral relationship that I mentioned in the Statement between the Iraqi Government and ourselves. We, of course, agree that the long-term future of Iraq will be appropriately secured when people are able to return home and continue the lives that they had before. I, too, saw the reports about interpreters; as noble Lords know from a number of questions after previous Statements, not least from the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, we believe that we should treat these important people appropriately. I absolutely accept the relevance and importance of their role. It is my understanding that that is being done. I do not have numbers for how many are here; if I am able to get them I shall ensure that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, and others are aware of them.</p>

<a name="80722-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08072254000255"></a>For obvious reasons, I shall not discuss the role of the French President or the voices in the USA on any of these issues, particularly on Afghanistan, and noble Lords would not expect me to after this particular Statement. None the less, the Government are mindful of what is being said and we will make sure that we keep in touch with what voices are raised in any country on these important issues. This is not about populism; it is about making sure that we achieve the objectives that we have set ourselves in Basra. I hope that noble Lords will accept from the Statement that we have made important movement in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08072254000256"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, focused in his opening remarks on reconstruction and I agree with him that it is important. It is an emphasis that my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for International Development have rightly placed on the work that we are doing. It is important to ensure that there is economic investment, that we support the role of small businesses and the growth of enterprise and, as we indicated, that we provide support and training for teachers, support for the health service and so forth.</p>

<a name="80722-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08072254000257"></a>I do not agree with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about our being there. It is certainly true that we no longer have Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It is also true that many of the opportunities in health and education and even the supply of basic necessities for people were available to only part of the population. We are involved in making sure that the whole population in Iraq is able to enjoy the basic amenities of life and continuing and developing economic opportunities. As I said, we will consider troop reductions as appropriate. Those troops who are based in Basra know how long they are there in terms of their tour of duty. We continue to keep the situation under review and work closely with the commanders in the ways that I mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08072254000258"></a>Both noble Lords referred to the situation with Iran. We know about the relationship between Iran and Iraq. Iran has a legitimate interest in the future of Iraq. There have been strong cultural, religious and economic ties. We welcome and encourage what we would regard as a healthy and constructive relationship. But Iranian actions run counter to the professed desire for a stable, prosperous Iraq. There are serious concerns about continued Iranian support for illegal Shia militia groups in Iraq. We know that elements of the Iranian state are providing material, training and funding against the Iraqi security forces. Of course, that undermines the elected Government of Iraq and causes further violence. We and the Iraqi Government have made it clear to Iran that it needs to cut ties and links with those groups and improve security on the border with Iraq to prevent the transfer of weaponry. Coalition forces continue to work to counter threats caused by illegal armed groups and to prevent the malign external support for them.</p>

How that is exactly quantified, even with the detailed list of tasks contained in the Statement, is not at all clear. After all, it was only a short time ago&#151;about six months&#151;that he was completely confident that our forces had indeed achieved over the four years all that it was possible for them to achieve in that part of the country and that they had achieved a great deal both in peace enforcement and latterly in what he described as the overwatch of training.</p>

It must be remembered that we have very good coalition reasons to want to be out of Iraq. As the Chief of the Defence Staff said recently, we are not geared to or capable of engaging in conflict on two fronts, particularly in the present funding climate. To come out would enable us to do better and more securely the things that we need to do and which can be so helpful to all our allies in Afghanistan, which is now the most important focal point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08072254000266"></a>Finally, does the noble Baroness not think that we may be sacrificing military effectiveness and military needs for short-term political considerations, which may change anyway next November?</p>

Within the Statement, I set out&#151;I thought quite clearly&#151;the issues that we believe we need to continue to deal with, including consideration of the troop level that we need to maintain. To recap quickly, those issues are training the 14th Division, preparing Basra airport for transfer to Iraqi control, pushing forward on economic development and providing the necessary support for provincial elections. My right honourable friend was very clear in another place and in my discussions with him that those are important aspects of securing the future of Iraq. Until we have secured them, we need to make sure that we have the appropriate levels of personnel. There is no short-term expediency in this. It is about honouring the obligations that we have to the Iraqi people.</p>

Critical comments about Syria and Iran are undoubtedly well deserved, and problems continue on the northern frontier with Turkey. Does this not demonstrate that we will never have a stable situation in that region until there is some multilateral framework in which Iraq and all its neighbours participate and in which they commit themselves to respect one another&#146;s borders and sovereignty, not to interfere and to work together for economic development? That idea crops up from time to time and then invariably disappears like a mirage. I have no doubt that some of the regional participants are responsible for the absence of progress, but is it not important to reinstate that idea, now that things are going a bit better, as an important medium-term objective that we should all pursue?</p>

Can the noble Baroness confirm that freedom of religion and the protection of minorities will be an important factor in solving the displacement and refugee issues?</p>

I think that we all welcome the United Arab Emirates&#146; important write-off, which I read about yesterday. Hydrocarbons are very important indeed. The Bill has not yet gone through, but I completely agree with the noble Lord that it is important for the future of oil in the region. Local non-governmental organisations and other international organisations are important in looking at issues facing refugees returning to their homes in Iraq. Freedom of religion is very much part of the work of the Ministry of Human Rights in Iraq.</p>

Can she remind us what proportion of Britain&#146;s &#163;40 billion defence expenditure is being spent on operations in Iraq? As we are carrying out a disproportionately large amount of the military operation in Iraq, does she regard it as reasonable that Britain should also be paying the whole cost of that contribution? Are the Government doing anything to secure some sort of burden sharing with those on whose behalf we are carrying out our military operations? I say that in the context of the financial cash-flow crisis that the Government face, which, as the Minister will probably recognise, could well result in government borrowing going up by &#163;70 billion&#151;that is, another 5 per cent of GDP.</p>

As the noble Lord will know, the defence budget is about &#163;34 billion for 2008-09; I do not have the breakdown of exactly what is being spent in any current theatre of operation. We are certainly operating within the UN Security Council resolution. However, as I indicated in the Statement, our ambition is to move to a bilateral agreement with the Iraqi Government&#151;what I might describe as a more normal arrangement between Britain and a state with which we are collaborating to deal with the issues that it faces.</p>

What is the forecast for the following year? Iraq is an oil-rich state and the volume of resources available from oil determines the Government&#146;s capacity to achieve an improvement in infrastructure and the standard of living. If she cannot answer today, perhaps she could do so later in writing. This is a vital element. We talk about the military, but not much about the huge potential resources in Iraq.</p>

The noble Lord is completely right that this is an oil-rich state with huge reserves of oil and great potential&#151;hence the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, about hydrocarbons legislation, which is an important element of that. We must work closely to ensure that we provide the technical support necessary to enable Iraq to exploit its oil reserves appropriately.</p>

The report covers the period 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2008. Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of the House. I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, who was the chairman over this period, and to all the other members, for giving their time and expertise so freely.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08072255000031"></a>As the House has previously been informed, the business of this important committee has been managed by Sir John Blelloch since the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, stepped down as chairman on health grounds in March this year. I wish to thank him for generously agreeing to extend his service further for this purpose.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08072255000032"></a>The Government intend to refresh the membership of the committee over the coming months. I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, who is currently serving on the committee, has agreed to step into the role of chairman in this interim period.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08072255000075"></a>In July 2007, the Prime Minister asked my right honourable friend the Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr Ingram) to undertake a detailed study into the role of the Ministry of Defence in counterterrorism and resilience. Mr Ingram has now submitted his report.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08072255000076"></a>His study provides a thorough analysis of the Ministry of Defence&#146;s role and of the capabilities it brings to bear in support of the Government&#146;s counterterrorism strategy&#151;CONTEST&#151;and domestic resilience. It reinforces a central theme of the national security strategy&#151;that security threats and hazards are intertwined, with no simple distinctions between defence and wider security and between domestic and overseas considerations. It endorses the direction in which the Government are moving the security agenda, and it makes a number of recommendations as to how the Ministry of Defence could further refine its support in these important areas.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="08072255000092"></a><a name="80722-wms0001.htm_spmin10"></a><b><a name="80722-wms0001.htm_spmin11"></a><a name="08072255000569"></a>The Attorney-General (Baroness Scotland of Asthal):</b> My honourable friend the Solicitor-General (Vera Baird) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="08072255000093"></a>On 20 February 2007 the then Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith, announced a review of criminal cases in which Dr David Southall had been a prosecution  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS136"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column WS136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>witness. The General Medical Council (GMC) had started a hearing to examine allegations that Dr Southall had kept so-called special case (SC) files containing original medical records relating to his patients that were not also kept on the child&#146;s official hospital file. These files relate to the period 1980-2000. Concerns had been expressed that in some of those cases criminal proceedings may have been brought but the existence of the files not revealed, resulting in their not being available for disclosure as part of the prosecution process.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="08072255000094"></a>It was not clear at that stage whether there had been any such failures to discharge disclosure obligations. Lord Goldsmith decided to assess cases in which Dr Southall had been instructed as a prosecution witness to determine whether he had kept a separate SC file, and if so to determine what further review might be required.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="08072255000095"></a>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) undertook that assessment, establishing a project board and a review team under the leadership of a chief Crown prosecutor. The review team:</p>
identified criminal prosecutions to which individual SC files could be linked;retrieved original prosecution files;reviewed the SC files against the contents of the associated prosecution files to assess whether there were any grounds for concern as to whether the obligations of disclosure to the defence had been fully discharged; andreported their findings to the Attorney-General. 
<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="08072255000096"></a>Dr Southall provided all the SC files he held&#151;a total of 4,344 files&#151;in accordance with his undertaking to the GMC. Of the 4,344 SC files reviewed by the team, 82 were found to be linked to court proceedings of some kind. Of those, 40 were established to have been associated with a criminal prosecution conducted in this jurisdiction.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="08072255000097"></a>The review team then checked CPS records against these 40 SC files and identified a total of seven CPS prosecution files linked with a total of nine SC files. On reviewing these files in depth, the team found no grounds to suggest that there had been a failure to comply with the prosecution&#146;s obligations of disclosure to the defence. Accordingly the review team has advised, and the Attorney-General and I accept, that there is no reason to indicate that any of these cases needs to be referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="08072255000098"></a>The ability of the review team to identify whether an SC file was linked with a prosecution, and then to locate the original prosecution papers, was constrained by a number of wholly practical factors. The team had to rely on the contents of the SC file for information suggesting that there might be linked criminal proceedings. In some older cases where there was such a link, the prosecution file no longer existed because of the application of the normal procedures for file destruction within the CPS after set periods of time. Differences between the methods of identifying SC files (which were linked to the patient) and CPS prosecution files (recorded by the name of the defendant) also made linking SC files to prosecution files difficult.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="08072255000099"></a>None the less this review has been a valuable and worthwhile exercise. The review team has approached its task conscientiously and with care and thoroughness, for which the Attorney-General and I thank them.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="08072255000100"></a>The report makes a number of recommendations designed to reinforce the message that expert witnesses must fully understand their responsibilities in relation to the disclosure of information in criminal cases. These are explained in the CPS/ACPO <I>Guidance Booklet for Experts</I>. The report&#146;s recommendations have been accepted and are being taken forward.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="08072255000101"></a>Recommendation 7 is that the Department of Health and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) should consider whether to conduct a similar review in relation to possible disclosure failings in family court proceedings. The DCSF has now considered this recommendation&#151;it agrees that there should be such a review and that it is the appropriate department to conduct it. The review will focus on the 82 SC files which the review team found were linked to court proceedings of some kind. Thirty-six of these were definitely linked to family proceedings. It is to be noted that if a disclosure failure were detected, this may, or may not, have any impact on the case, bearing in mind the passage of time and the fact that the welfare of the child is paramount in family proceedings. However, the DCSF will follow the recommendation of the review team and conduct a review of the family cases.</p>

It is estimated that the benefits of this decision will be approximately &#163;27 million for 18 heavily indebted poor countries. The payments relate to the UK share of future debt service payments on public sector loans signed by HIPCs before 2 December 2000 under the Lom&#233; conventions.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="08072255000104"></a>The UK share of the Lom&#233; debt service on loans of EDF money is received by DfID from the EIB. Part of this debt service relates to public sector loans signed before 2 December 2000 by HIPCs. DfID has made a decision to stop receiving this part of the debt service. All moneys previously received by DfID through the Lom&#233; debt service have been used for international development.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a><a name="08072255000140"></a>I have today issued a consultation document on the SSA process and criteria. Alongside this, the Government are publishing a study of the environmental and sustainability effects of the siting of new nuclear power stations in accordance with the proposed SSA criteria. The Government are seeking views from members of the public, industry, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or any other organisation, body or individual with an interest. The Government are also publishing today a habitats regulations assessment screening report and the environmental study appendices.</p>

My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Justice (Bridget Prentice), my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office (Meg Hillier) and the Cabinet Secretary for Justice in Scotland (Kenny McAskill) will attend on behalf of the United Kingdom. As the provisional agenda stands, the following items will be discussed.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a><a name="08072255000144"></a>The morning of the council will focus on asylum and immigration business, starting with a state of play report on the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum. The pact covers five areas: legal migration of third-country nationals, illegal immigration and returns; border controls; asylum; and partnership with countries  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS140"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column WS140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of origin and transit (the global approach). The presidency is seeking agreement on the pact in time for the 15 October European Council. We support the strong focus on immigration and asylum issues under the French presidency and will use this as a basis for stronger practical co-operation in the EU. The Government are generally content with the pact but will continue to work with the presidency on the detail of the final document.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"></a><a name="08072255000145"></a>There will follow a discussion on the directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment (commonly known as the EU Blue Card), which aims to set admission conditions for highly skilled migrants. It also proposes to determine the conditions in which third-country nationals who are legally residing in a member state under the proposal may reside with their family members in other member states. The French presidency is aiming for political agreement at the September JHA Council. The UK has not opted into this measure since it does not fit with the UK&#146;s points-based system.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_106"></a><a name="08072255000146"></a>The presidency is seeking an agreement to the directive providing for sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals by member states. The UK chose not to opt into this directive as a result of concerns in relation to the proposed definition of employer, a notification requirement and inspections. However, the UK is seeking to influence discussions in order to amend the text in a manner which would allow a review of our opt-in position post-adoption of the directive.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a><a name="08072255000147"></a>The council will be asked to agree conclusions on the taking-in of Iraqi refugees by member states. The Government strongly agree that member states should be able to determine their own resettlement policies. The UK will continue to resettle Iraqi refugees under our established policies and selection criteria and does not consider common resettlement criteria to be feasible. We support sharing good practice.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="08072255000148"></a>The presidency would like to reach a general approach on the directive amending directive 2003/109/EC to extend its scope to beneficiaries of international protection. The UK has chosen not to opt into the proposed directive as we believe it is not in line with our frontiers protocol.  We want to determine the status of third-country nationals via the UK&#146;s Immigration Rules.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="08072255000149"></a>The council then reverts to discussions on interior business, starting with the Mixed Committee with Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. The presidency will present a state of play report on the draft regulation amending common consular instructions on visas for diplomatic and consular posts in relation to the introduction of biometrics. Although the United Kingdom does not participate in issuing Schengen visas, we welcome the efforts of Schengen member states in ensuring that the Schengen external EU borders are as secure as possible.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a><a name="08072255000150"></a>The Commission will also update the council on the state of play of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II). The presidency will also look to agree the council regulation and council decision on the migration of SISI+ to SIS II.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a><a name="08072255000151"></a>Under any other business in Mixed Committee, the Commission will present its communication on visa reciprocity. Although the United Kingdom does not participate in the EU common visa policy, the United Kingdom will continue to support the principle of reciprocity and extending the US visa waiver program to all EU member states.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a><a name="08072255000152"></a>The presidency intends to present its proposed working method on the passenger name records framework decision to the council. Its approach will focus on seeking agreement on the key issues of the dossier, namely scope, the depth of harmonisation necessary, data protection and relations with third countries.  The presidency will also suggest that there should be consultation with data protection authorities, the European Parliament and carriers. The UK is in broad agreement with this approach and welcomes the ambitious programme of work outlined in the French proposal.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_113"></a><a name="08072255000153"></a>The presidency will present the final reports of the Future Groups on Home Affairs and on Justice, which  aim to provide input to the new JHA work programme that will replace the Hague programme at the end of 2009.  The Government see these reports as one element among several that should feed the debate on the direction of the new work programme.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a><a name="08072255000154"></a>The presidency will propose taking forward work to improve co-operation in tackling cybercrime.  The UK supports action in this area to promote co-operation between private industry and public authorities, as well as between law enforcement.  We will work with the presidency to develop its ideas.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a><a name="08072255000155"></a>On the morning of the second day, the council will move to justice issues.  The presidency will seek political agreement on the council decision on strengthening Eurojust.  This instrument aims to improve the efficiency of Eurojust, including by giving national members a minimum set of powers and increasing the flow of information between national competent authorities and Eurojust.  The Government are content with the outcome of negotiations and believe the draft strikes a good balance.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a><a name="08072255000156"></a>The French presidency will also seek political agreement on the council decision amending the European judicial network. This instrument is intended to update and replace the 1998 joint action which established the European judicial network and take account of subsequent developments in EU judicial co-operation, including the establishment of Eurojust in 2002. The Government are generally content with what is proposed.    </p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_117"></a><a name="08072255000157"></a>The presidency will present a proposal for a council decision on the establishment of the European criminal records information system (ECRIS). There will be a policy debate on this measure which aims to find a standardised format for exchange of the content of a conviction, as well as other general and technical implementation aspects of the information exchange.  The Government strongly support this measure in so far as it aims to improve and speed up the arrangements for exchanging information on past convictions.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_118"></a><a name="08072255000158"></a>There will be a policy debate about the Rome III regulation (choice of law in divorce). The UK did not opt into the negotiations on this proposal.  Member states have been unable to reach agreement on the measure, and some now wish to proceed by way of enhanced co-operation.  The treaty provides for this,

If it went ahead, it would be first use of enhanced co-operation.  There is no expectation that the UK will participate and the Government do not intend to do so.</p>

<a name="08072255000230"></a><a name="80722-wms0003.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80722-wms0003.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08072255000577"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Ashton of Upholland):</b> My right honourable friend the Prime Minister (Gordon Brown MP) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_188"></a><a name="08072255000231"></a>I have today laid before both Houses the annual reports of the Chief Surveillance Commissioner, the right honourable Sir Christopher Rose (HC 659), of the Interception of Communications Commissioner, the right honourable Sir Paul Kennedy (HC 947) and of the Intelligence Services Commissioner, the right honourable Sir Peter Gibson (HC 948).</p>

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_189"></a><a name="08072255000232"></a>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) established the regulatory framework for the use of a wide range of investigatory techniques. It sets out the purposes for which the powers can be used, the public authorities that can use them, the authorisation procedures that they must follow and the use that can be made of the material obtained. It also provides for an appropriate oversight regime and a means of redress through the independent Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The reports that I have laid before Parliament today set out how the RIPA investigatory powers have been used during the periods covered.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_190"></a><a name="08072255000233"></a>The Government continue to believe that the existing system of authorisations, inspections and other safeguards set out in RIPA is appropriate, and welcome the valuable oversight role discharged by the commissioners appointed under the RIPA. The independent oversight that they provide is vital in ensuring that the various powers are used appropriately and only when necessary and proportionate.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_191"></a><a name="08072255000234"></a>The Interception Commissioner&#146;s report notes that the Investigatory Powers Tribunal reached determinations on 83 cases during the period covered. The tribunal did not uphold any complaints during this period. A great deal has been done already to improve public authorities&#146; awareness of the obligations placed on them, and to ensure that proper consideration is given to necessity and proportionality. We recognise, however, that there is always more that can be done. The Government are reviewing those public authorities that have access to these powers to ensure that they have a continuing and justifiable requirement for them. On completion, the Government will list the authorities that can use each of the powers and the purposes for which they can use them, and set out revised statutory codes of practice, which Parliament will have the opportunity to debate.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_203"></a><a name="08072255000250"></a>On 19 March, I published the United Kingdom&#146;s first ever <I>National Security Strategy</I>. It set out how we proposed to address and manage an increasingly diverse but interconnected set of security challenges and some of their underlying factors including climate change, competition for energy, poverty and globalisation. The aim is to safeguard the nation, its citizens, our prosperity and our way of life, against a constantly changing security environment. I want to update the House on arrangements for support to the National Security Committee and proposals for parliamentary oversight of the delivery of the strategy.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_204"></a><a name="08072255000251"></a>As envisaged in the <I>National Security Strategy</I>, the Government will be establishing a National Security Forum. We want to promote a constructive and informed dialogue with experts, stakeholders and the public to understand the security challenges we face and how we need to tackle them. The forum will have a core group of 12 publicly appointed members reflecting the broad range of the subject areas in the <I>National Security Strategy</I>. It is likely to include people with a range of experience and expertise in these issues; and, in addition to this core group, we will create a register of up to 100 expert associates who could be called upon to provide advice in specific areas. The purpose of the forum will be to provide expert advice to the National Security Committee (Cabinet Committee on National Security, International Relations and Development (NSID)). It will be invited to focus on the published strategy to inform the annual updates, although it will be able to commission its own research subject to agreement of its programme by NSID.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_205"></a><a name="08072255000252"></a>In advance of setting up the forum as a non-departmental public body, I will be establishing an interim forum in the early autumn. For the interim forum only, the Government will appoint its members, on advice from the Cabinet Office. Though an interim body, it will begin substantive work immediately. The chair of the interim body will be announced shortly. The National Security Forum will be supported by a new National Security Secretariat in the Cabinet Office. Alongside that, a Horizon Scanning Unit will be established which will co-ordinate the security-related horizon scanning currently undertaken in a number of government departments, with the intention of giving it an overarching framework and a more coherent output.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_206"></a><a name="08072255000253"></a>It is important that we have the right form of parliamentary oversight of the <I>National Security Strategy</I> and its delivery. There are already a number of Select Committees, and the Intelligence and Security Committee, who have an interest in the development and implementation of the <I>National Security Strategy</I>; and any new arrangement should not duplicate their existing scrutiny work. I propose therefore to consult the parliamentary authorities and the Opposition through the usual channels about the establishment and terms of reference of a joint committee on the <I>National Security Strategy</I>, comprising the chairs of the key departmental Select Committees with an interest in national security, and other Members of Parliament and Peers with particular interests or experience.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_207"></a><a name="08072255000254"></a>In March, I said that the Government would publish a &#147;national level risk register setting out our assessment of the likelihood and potential impact of a range of

We will be writing shortly to the chairs of the relevant Select Committees with our National Risk Register and placing copies in the library of the House. Its purpose is specifically to give the public information about risks to the UK from natural disasters, accidents and malicious threats over the next five years so that those who wish to can prepare for the consequences. The National Risk Register will be a key tool in the development of community resilience networks, another <I>National Security Strategy</I> deliverable, which the Cabinet Office will be taking forward in the coming months and is the next step in improving the UK&#146;s resilience.</p>

These results are evidence that the RDAs continue to play a valuable role in improving the economic performance of the English regions and, through working with their partners, the RDAs are making a real difference to the individual regional economies concerned. The figures cover the number of jobs created and safeguarded, the number of people assisted to get a job, the amount of brownfield land brought back into use, the number of businesses created, the number of businesses assisted to improve their performance, the number of people assisted in their skills development and the amount of public and private sector regeneration infrastructure investment levered, all as a result of RDA activity.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_217"></a><a name="08072255000268"></a>The panel report endorsed the strategy set out in the draft RSS, but made numerous recommendations to clarify and improve it. The Secretary of State has considered all the panel&#146;s recommendations, along with other relevant evidence, together with updates to the sustainability appraisal and a habitats regulations assessment. The main changes proposed are:</p>
increased housing growth across the region to 21,750 per year for the period 2006-26. Much of the additional growth is proposed in and around the main cities of Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, recognising growth related to growth point agreements in those cities and surrounding areas (the three cities growth point) and in other growth point agreements at Lincoln, Newark and Grantham;no change to growth area plans in Northamptonshire, which were set in the Milton Keynes and south Midlands sub-regional strategy in 2005, though the plan period for the area is extended to 2026 and the

There will now be a public consultation period of 12 weeks on the proposed changes, which will end on 17 October.

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_219"></a><a name="08072255000271"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities is today publishing proposed changes to the draft revisions of the regional spatial strategy for the south-west.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_220"></a><a name="08072255000272"></a>The regional spatial strategy forms part of the statutory development plan for every local authority in the south-west and sets the framework for the production of local development frameworks and local transport plans. It provides the spatial plan for the development of the region, and provides the policy framework for employment, housing, transport and the environment.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_221"></a><a name="08072255000273"></a>The current strategy, initially published as regional planning guidance, became the regional spatial strategy in September 2004 with the enactment of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act. A draft revision of the regional spatial strategy was submitted to the Government in April 2006 by the South West Regional Assembly. It was subsequently tested in an examination in public (EIP) between April and July 2007 and the report of the independent panel which conducted this examination was published in January this year. The Secretary of State has considered the recommendations of the independent panel which held the EIP and has taken into account the representations made on the draft revision, and changes in government policy since the draft revision was submitted.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_24"></a>
<a name="08072255000533"></a><a name="80722-wms0005.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80722-wms0005.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08072255000588"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My right honourable friend the Minster for Security, Counterterrorism, Crime and Policing (Tony McNulty) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_480"></a><a name="08072255000534"></a>My right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced in his Statement on 14 November 2007 a review of what more we need to do to strengthen security to protect against the use of hazardous substances for terrorist purposes. This review has been completed. I do not intend to publish it, because I do not wish in any way to compromise our security. However, this Statement provides a summary of the main conclusions of the review.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_481"></a><a name="08072255000535"></a>The review shows that a substantial amount of work has been undertaken in this area. It also identifies areas where further improvements could be made but recognises that we must ensure that protective security measures are proportionate to the risk. We need to ensure that individuals and businesses are free to carry on normal social, economic and democratic activities and, as a result, there will always be some vulnerability to the use of hazardous substances for terrorist purposes.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_482"></a><a name="08072255000536"></a>First, it is important to underline that considerable progress has already been made in recent years to reduce our vulnerability to the use of hazardous substances for terrorist purposes. The National Counter Terrorism Security Office (NaCTSO) provides specialist advice regarding the security of a variety of hazardous substances. It has undertaken a range of activities to reduce the vulnerability of hazardous substances. These include &#147;Know Your Customer&#148; campaigns, to raise awareness about the &#147;dual-use&#148; nature of certain products and encouraging suppliers to be more inquiring of new customers and to report suspicious enquiries to police. NaCTSO has also played an important role in overseeing local police counterterrorism security advisers who implement Part 7 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which provides the police with powers to impose security measures at laboratories that hold certain dangerous pathogens and toxins.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_483"></a><a name="08072255000537"></a>The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) is the government authority on protective security in relation to national security threats. The CPNI works with NaCTSO to advise businesses and organisations on the security of hazardous substances and sites.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_484"></a><a name="08072255000538"></a>The Environment Agency has managed a government-subsidised programme that has disposed of more than 9,000 disused radioactive sources from hospitals, universities, museums, schools and other sites across the UK. The Environment Agency, and its sister agencies in Scotland and Northern Ireland, working in partnership with NaCTSO, are also regulating the security of radioactive sources used at hospitals, universities and industrial sites throughout the UK. This review did not cover those nuclear or radiological materials used in the civil nuclear sector, as they fall under the specific regulatory regime led by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_485"></a><a name="08072255000539"></a>The Transport Security and Contingencies Directorate of the Department for Transport (Transec) enforces a statutory regime for the security of dangerous goods  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS153"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column WS153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in transit. The Department for Transport&#146;s Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) carries out inspections of vehicles at the roadside, and of road depots, on behalf of Transec. Transec&#146;s own inspectors carry out compliance activity for the movement of dangerous goods by rail in the UK.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_486"></a><a name="08072255000540"></a>The Government also welcome the steps that industry has been taking, through a knowledge of its customers and through codes of conduct, to help reduce the chances of abuse of hazardous substances. For instance, the UK Fertiliser Industry has developed, at the request of the UK Government, the Fertiliser Industry Assurance Scheme (FIAS).</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_487"></a><a name="08072255000541"></a>The main outcome of the review is a new risk-based strategic framework to drive prioritisation of work to reduce the accessibility of hazardous substances for terrorist purposes. This will enable work to focus on reducing the accessibility of hazardous substances considered to be at highest risk, taking account of the need for a proportionate, cost-effective and practical response. This will allow us to target resources where most needed and to improve the security of hazardous substances even further.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_488"></a><a name="08072255000542"></a>The framework will direct a cross-government programme of work to reduce the vulnerability of highest risk substances. This programme will be delivered under the &#147;protect&#148; strand of the Government&#146;s counterterrorism strategy (CONTEST) and will be led by the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism in the Home Office.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_489"></a><a name="08072255000543"></a>This framework has prioritised hazardous substances on the basis of the risk that they pose, taking account of the threat, vulnerability and impact of those substances. The review examined the vulnerability of substances across their life cycle, from their precursors through to their disposal.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_490"></a><a name="08072255000544"></a>We are reviewing the pathogens and toxins listed under Schedule 5 to the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 with the assistance of the Health Protection Agency. We are also considering whether further legislative changes are required to clarify the scope of the application of the legislation and will consult on any proposed changes in due course as appropriate.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_491"></a><a name="08072255000545"></a>Another example of specific work under way as a result of the review is a joint Department for Transport/Home Office project, which has been established to agree an impact-based list of substances of most concern, to inform our assessment of the risk and to identify areas for further reduction of the vulnerability of these substances throughout the supply chain, including transportation.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_492"></a><a name="08072255000546"></a>We will continue to reduce the risks from the illicit transportation of hazardous substances at the UK border. We will build upon existing initiatives such as Programme Cyclamen, which provides radiation-screening capability at UK points of entry to prevent the illicit importation of radiological substances, and we will use the strategic framework to inform counterterrorism requirements at the UK border, in conjunction with the UK Border Agency, the national co-ordinator of ports policing and other stakeholders.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_493"></a><a name="08072255000547"></a>We are also considering what further work may be appropriate to reduce the vulnerability of hazardous sites and substances to insider action. This will build on existing work led by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and take account of the findings of the independent review of personnel security in the transport sector by Stephen Boys Smith.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_494"></a><a name="08072255000548"></a>In taking forward this work, the Government recognise the importance of engaging fully with industry and academia. In particular, we are committed to working with them to identify proportionate, risk-based measures. Equally important is the need to work with international partners to reduce the risk of terrorists acquiring hazardous substances. For example, we are currently working with our European partners to reduce the availability of high-grade ammonium nitrate fertiliser.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_495"></a><a name="08072255000549"></a>Taken together, the various recommendations of the review will further reduce the risk of terrorists obtaining hazardous substances and will increase the likelihood that those attempting to access such materials will be detected.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_25"></a>
<a name="08072255000550"></a><a name="80722-wms0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80722-wms0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08072255000589"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_496"></a><a name="08072255000551"></a>Last December I commissioned an independent review of personnel security across the transport sector. This followed Lord West&#146;s review last year which focused on physical infrastructure and confirmed that, although it is impossible to eliminate every risk, a robust transport security regime is in place. The review of personnel security was conducted by Stephen Boys Smith who has now delivered his report. It contains a detailed assessment of current security processes and recommendations of where changes might be needed. Because of the sensitive nature of the subject matter, it is not appropriate to publish it in full, but I have published a short summary of the report, and of its key recommendations.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_497"></a><a name="08072255000552"></a>The Government and the transport industries are committed to countering the threat from terrorism. The existing security regime encompasses a wide range of measures which seek to reduce the potential threat from insiders. These measures include both personnel security measures, such as background checks, and physical security measures, such as the searching and screening requirements. Many of these physical security measures apply to industry staff as well as passengers. For instance, the UK requires airports to screen 100 per cent of staff working in the restricted zone, and has played a leading role in ensuring that this approach has been incorporated into European regulations, as well as promoting it elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_498"></a><a name="08072255000553"></a>Stephen Boys Smith's report acknowledges the effectiveness of the UK transport security regime, which overlaps multiple layers of security measures in this way. But the report also points out that the more effectively the security regime mitigates external threats, the more likely it becomes that terrorists will look for vulnerabilities elsewhere. I therefore agree with the key message of the report: that there should be an increased  


<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS155"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column WS155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>focus on personnel security and that this should be informed by systematic analysis of the risks. This is consistent with work already in hand within the Government&#146;s counterterrorism strategy, CONTEST, where personnel security is one of the work streams.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_499"></a><a name="08072255000554"></a>The most important challenge will be to integrate fully a risk-based approach to personnel security into industry practices. This clearly cannot be delivered by the Government alone. Only the industry has the detailed knowledge of its operations and systems that is needed accurately to identify the specific personnel security risks that it faces and how they might be mitigated. But the Government have a vital role to play in raising awareness of personnel security issues within the industry, providing guidance and support to the industry, and ensuring that full and rigorous assessments are carried out and that appropriate action is taken where vulnerabilities are identified</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_500"></a><a name="08072255000555"></a>For this reason, I have asked my department to ensure with immediate effect that industry's attention is drawn to the advice which is already available (for example, that issued by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure), and to enhance the personnel security elements of our existing training programmes. Alongside this, my officials will urgently work up policy options over the summer for a cross-industry conference, to be held in the autumn. This conference will identify the most effective approaches to embedding risk assessment in the personnel security regime. The next phase will be for government and industry to work together, including through ongoing working groups such as the National Aviation Security Committee, to ensure that the necessary risk assessments are carried out and a clear programme of work delivered. This will require sustained effort by all.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_501"></a><a name="08072255000556"></a>I agree with the report&#146;s view that identity is a key factor in personnel security regimes and note its conclusion that ID cards are a useful addition to identity assurance. This endorses the announcement by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary on 6 March that ID cards will be part of the identity assurance regime for airside workers, starting in 2009. Officials from the Home Office and my department are currently in discussion with the industry about how best to do this.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_502"></a><a name="08072255000557"></a>I also accept the report&#146;s advice that, in the light of experience both in the Security Industry Association (SIA) and within some sectors of the transport industry, overseas criminal record checks are now a more viable option than they have been in the past.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS156"></a><b>22 July 2008 : Column WS156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_503"></a><a name="08072255000558"></a>While checks of this kind are primarily intended to reduce crime, they can also provide a useful additional check on an applicant's integrity as part of the overall personnel security regime. I have therefore asked my department to produce clear guidance, building on the approach taken by the SIA, to support those organisations whose risk assessments identify posts for which checks of this kind are necessary. Wherever such posts are identified, I expect the industry to take rapid action, and my department will be engaging closely with them over the coming months to ensure that this is the case.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_504"></a><a name="08072255000559"></a>Alongside this voluntary approach, which extends existing good practice in the industry, I believe there is also a case for introducing a mandatory requirement for those posts which present the highest risks, such as those with specific security responsibilities (and which are already subject to a counterterrorism check). However, before such a requirement can be put in place, there remain a number of legal and practical challenges to be overcome. These including identifying an effective means of dealing with the variability of international criminal records systems and documentation, and developing an approach which does not have undue implications for the ongoing efficiency and security of industry operations.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_505"></a><a name="08072255000560"></a>I have therefore asked my department to begin immediate discussions with employers and employees in the industry to agree a workable and effective approach to introducing such a requirement, with a view to implementation by the end of the year. In line with Stephen Boys Smith's recommendation, I expect this to apply to new applicants for these posts, as employers can assess the integrity of existing employees in other, more effective ways.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_506"></a><a name="08072255000561"></a>Over the longer term, as the exchange of information between countries becomes more efficient, it may be appropriate to extend this requirement to other posts. I note here also the Statement made on 16 July by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary about Sir Ian Magee&#146;s review of criminality and the potential for overseas information to be more readily available to UK criminal record offices.</p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_507"></a><a name="08072255000562"></a>Finally, I agree with the view that while there should be some rebalancing of priorities between physical and personnel security activity, this should not result in a weakening of physical security programmes. </p>

<a name="80722-wms0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_508"></a><a name="08072255000563"></a>Copies of the report summary and recommendations have been laid in the Libraries of both Houses and will appear on the department&#146;s website.</p>

The programme will promote the lessons in one country, such as Malawi's experience with support to its fertilizer markets, more widely in the region. DfID also provides core-funding support to the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). AGRA's programme includes a $160 million soils health initiative.</p>

<a name="80722w0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_186"></a><a name="08072252000315"></a>Our support for new capacity at Heathrow, subject to meeting strict local environmental limits, is underpinned by detailed modelling of passenger demand up to 2030. These forecasts indicate that the range of domestic and international flights offered at Heathrow is crucial to the UK and particularly beneficial to the connectivity of passengers located in regions outside the south-east. As such, we have not modelled or assessed scenarios that would reduce the number of domestic flights or European flights from Heathrow. We have also not considered measures to reduce the number of transit passengers using Heathrow.</p>

<a name="80722w0002.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_187"></a><a name="08072252000316"></a>Ultimately, if policy support for further development at Heathrow is provided, it will be a commercial decision for the airport operator, working with its users, to decide which flights and destinations it wishes to operate in the future.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_311"></a><a name="08072252000472"></a>On crowded places, we have introduced a standard way of assessing risk which will for the first time provide baseline data about local areas with crowded places at highest risk. The investment of a further &#163;1.5 million during the financial year 2008-09, for additional counterterrorism security adviser (CTSA) posts, has meant that there are now more than 180 officers to support this work. We have also tripled the capacity of the national barrier asset (which provides temporary protection for the highest risk locations).</p>

<a name="80722w0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_312"></a><a name="08072252000473"></a>In the autumn, we will consult publicly about two key guidance documents: a new strategic framework to encourage greater partnership working at local level to reduce vulnerabilities of crowded places; and a counterterrorism supplement to the existing guidance <I>Safer Places</I><I>&#151;T</I><I>he Plan</I><I>ning System and Crime Prevention</I>, which will act as a practical guide for designers and planners.</p>

<a name="80722w0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_313"></a><a name="08072252000474"></a>The National Counter Terrorism Security Office (NaCTSO) is due to publish shortly two new protective security guidance booklets for cinemas, theatres, restaurants and hotels. Guidance tailored for the requirements of major events, education and health sectors, religious sites and commercial centres is also being prepared to supplement existing protective security guidance.</p>

<a name="80722w0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_314"></a><a name="08072252000475"></a>CTSAs have now delivered more than 460 ARGUS exercises (counterterrorism scenario-based training exercises for primarily retail businesses located in crowded places) since January 2007. A new ARGUS &#147;professional&#148; has been developed aimed at architects, planners, designers and developers following four pilots carried out earlier in 2008 across the UK. NaCTSO has also developed an ARGUS exercise for the &#147;night-time economy&#148;, which will be available from CTSAs from August 2008 onwards. Regional-based counterterrorism awareness briefings are also being provided to police architectural liaison officers in 2008-09.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_315"></a><a name="08072252000476"></a>On critical national infrastructure (CNI), a new infrastructure categorisation scheme has now been implemented. Sector sponsor departments and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) are reviewing our essential services to produce a new, up-to-date catalogue of national infrastructure. This includes information networks as well as physical sites for a more comprehensive picture of the UK&#146;s critical national infrastructure. The catalogue will be reviewed on a regular basis.</p>

<a name="80722w0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_316"></a><a name="08072252000477"></a>We are developing guidance to explain the Government&#146;s strategic approach to infrastructure protection, outlining the roles and responsibilities of those involved in critical national infrastructure protection, for sharing with key partners.

<a name="80722w0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_318"></a><a name="08072252000479"></a>We continue to balance the necessary response to the ongoing level of threat with the need for people to travel. Where necessary, we introduce additional requirements, such as those proposed in the transport security Bill. Where appropriate, we develop capability, such as our three-year operational trial of an extension to the British Transport Police's passenger screening announced on 26 June, and the introduction of vehicle restraint measures at key stations. Where possible we minimise the impact, such as lifting the &#147;one bag&#148; restriction on aircraft cabin baggage at 50 UK airports.</p>

The Equality and Human Rights Commission is already empowered to bring enforcement proceedings in situations where no identifiable victim has come forward&#151;for example, where it identifies discriminatory advertisements, discriminatory practices or where it otherwise thinks an unlawful act is likely to be committed. Our initial view, therefore, is that our existing legislative framework is compliant.

With regard to multi-ingredient herbal medicinal products, it is recognised that identification and assay of individual herbal ingredients in the herbal product is difficult to perform and sometimes impossible. The European Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products has recently developed a guideline, in consultation with industry, that addresses the issue of multi-ingredient herbal products. The guideline states that if testing for identity or assay or to demonstrate stability cannot be performed in the herbal product, alternative strategies may be considered. The guideline refers to appropriate fingerprint chromatograms, appropriate overall methods of assay and physical or other appropriate tests. The applicant is therefore able to select appropriate methods and justify their use.</p>

The UK continues to call on both parties to implement the AMA and has repeatedly raised its concerns about the continued restrictions on access to Gaza with the Israeli Government, in public and in private. Most recently, we and other EU member states expressed concerns about access restrictions faced by the UN in providing assistance to Palestinian refugees in a letter from the European Union presidency and the European Commission to the Israeli authorities on 27 June. More tangibly, the UK will also support a UN access team to help get humanitarian supplies and personnel through crossings and checkpoints.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_460"></a><a name="08072252000774"></a>Moves towards a ceasefire in Gaza are very welcome. The ceasefire is an important first step to improve the daily lives of ordinary people on both sides. We hope that the militant groups will fulfil their commitment to cease attacks on Israel, and that Israel will ease restrictions on Gaza in line with its own commitments, ensuring that humanitarian aid and supplies can get through. We need to build on the opportunity that the ceasefire represents by working towards the reopening of the crossings between Israel and Gaza, under the control of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
