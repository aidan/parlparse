<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Northbourne </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What action they are taking to address different academic success rates given that, in 2002, 23 per cent of boys from the Caribbean ethnic group achieved five passes at levels A to C in GCSE examinations, compared with 71 per cent from the Chinese ethnic group and 58 per cent from the Indian.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, in October 2003 the Government introduced a strategy to raise minority ethnic achievement. The strategy aims to ensure that mainstream school improvement programmes do as much as possible to narrow achievement gaps between the highest and lowest achieving groups and provide targeted support for those most at risk of underachieving. The targeted support includes a national project to raise the achievement of African Caribbean pupils, in particular boys, in secondary schools.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for that reply and am much encouraged to hear about the work under way in schools. Does she agree that families also have a hugely important role to play in motivating children to do well at school? For boys in particular, a father or other male role model in the family can be very influential. Would the Government be prepared to do more to consult local communities, in particular local ethnic minority communities, about what they feel is needed and then work with them to secure a situation in which more families give encouragement to their boys to work hard at school, thereby avoiding social exclusion later in life?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord that it is important to recognise the critical role played by families. Indeed, the success criteria identified in the work undertaken by Ofsted when examining schools which have been successful with children from different minority ethnic backgrounds shows that parental and community involvement are critical factors. However, I hesitate to suggest that families from the minority ethnic communities are anything other than fully engaged in wanting their children to achieve in educational terms. <P>


<a name="column_678"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 678</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Moreover, the Government certainly have a responsibility to communicate and discuss these issues to ensure that their views are heard properly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords, is not one of the main factors in the success of Chinese children the role of Chinese parents, who have traditionally attached great importance to education and communicate that to their children?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the success of the Chinese community is well noted. The noble Lord might be interested to learn that at key stage 3 in mathematics, 90 per cent of Chinese pupils attain the expected level compared with 71 per cent nationally. However, I have not yet met a family from a different minority ethnic group which does not have aspirations for its children. So I hesitate to imply in any way that there is a link between any particular minority ethnic group background and the role of families. A range of factors affect the attainment levels and achievement opportunities of our children. It is our job to address those factors and ensure that we provide the right kind of support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Chan: </B>   My Lords, regarding the group which has just been mentioned, I agree with the Minister that parental expectation is not the only factor. However, does she agree that one of the best ways to encourage children from a certain group is by providing support from other ethnic minority groups in the same area so as to foster cross-ethnic and cross-cultural support? I include white groups in my suggestion. In that way, the different groups are encouraged to attain better results.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Chan, has raised an important issue. What is clear from the research undertaken by Ofsted is that there are particular ways of operating and ways in which schools organise themselves that support children from all ethnic backgrounds. For example, an ethos of respect forms a critical part of the effort, as does effective teaching and learning within a curriculum that reflects the culture and communities of pupils right across the individual school. Such factors are essential in seeking to ensure that all children succeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   My Lords, what studies have been made of the relationship between the underachievement of boys from all ethnic groups and the standards of discipline in schools? If not, do the Government have plans to do so?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware of any studies that correlate those two particular factors because, again, one feels that there might be an underlying assumption about discipline and what happens in relation to the achievement of boys. The gap in the level of attainment between girls and boys has been remarked on previously in your Lordships' House. It is important to understand fully <P>


<a name="column_679"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 679</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the factors relating to the underachievement of boys in general and then, within that, to unpick those factors which relate to particular groups of boys, some of whom do well in primary education but then fail to do so well at the secondary level.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </B>   My Lords, is there any difference between the attainment of Afro-Caribbean boys educated in all-boys schools and those educated in mixed schools?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I do not have any specific statistics for Afro-Caribbean boys. However, I am aware that it is very difficult to make correlations between single-sex education and co-education because so much depends on the ethos and style of the school itself and the approach it takes to its own form of education. Given that, there are no direct correlations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Howells of St Davids: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that all noble Lords are aware that Caribbean people are the most researched group in the world. However, I should like to point out that, from the Caribbean perspective, the problem faced by Caribbean parents concerns discipline. Has any thought been given to offering support to Caribbean parents and communities? We have started up supplementary schools, but the Government have never been generous in their support of those parents who give their time at the weekends to help in such schools.
<P>

<a name="40427-01_para0"></a>Discipline is the criterion. A child coming from the Caribbean can enter university over here without having to take an access course. Something is happening in Britain. I can assure my noble friend that the Caribbean community feels very strongly that no government have offered support to families in bringing up their children. Those who come from secure families get on well, something to which this House can attest. It is the kids without support structures who suffer. What are the Government doing? Will they put money into supplementary schools in order to help parents? I ask that because reports do not help.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I am huge fan of the role of supplementary schools. It is well known in the department that I feel very strongly that we need to do more to support them, not least because they have been very successful in helping to endorse the principles of a good education for children. As the noble Baroness said, it is often parents and teachers who give up their spare time and persuade children on a Saturday morning to spend time having a new and different learning experience. We are working with our education authorities and our schools to try to get a better support mechanism. As the noble Baroness pointed out, none of us has dealt with this issue as effectively as we might. My aspiration is that we can certainly do more.

<a name="40427-01_para1"></a>Support structures are absolutely critical. From the work that has been carried out on what it is that helps these children succeed, it is clear that strong expectations and strong leadership are involved.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Quirk </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>With respect to the Crick report of September 2003 entitled The New and the Old, on the naturalisation of new British citizens, when they will implement the recommendations that they have accepted in principle.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My Lords, I refer to the Written Ministerial Statement that I made on 2 February and to the related papers deposited in the Library which set out the steps Her Majesty's Government are taking to implement the recommendations of The New and the Old. Since then, effort has been concentrated on the spending review process and on exploring the practicalities of piloting language with citizenship programmes in some areas from within existing resources.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful update on her statement of 2 February, although I cannot help noting that it seems to be the recommendations that cost money that are most lagging in this process, including the provision of English. Does not the Minister agree that integration of our new citizens depends crucially on their speedy acquisition of fluent English, not least as a passport to suitable employment? Is it not the case that English teaching is especially important for women, notably the mothers in traditional families, who without it will unwittingly no doubt, but inevitably, hinder their children's progress as they enter primary education?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040427/text/40427-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Lord, Lord Quirk, about the contribution that an acquisition of English can play in assisting people to reach their goals in terms of employment, integration and self-support. However, it is not only the recommendations that cost money; it is important to get in place the right kind of support structure. I have said already that the spending review round is therefore very important. We are, of course, hoping for the most generous allocation we can get.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask the Minister about the civic ceremonies of naturalisation referred to in recommendations 19 to 21 of the second Crick report. As we know, these are being piloted and one has taken place with a fair degree of favourable publicity. Can she comment on how the Government are evaluating this pilot scheme and what plans there are for the future of such ceremonies?
<P>


<a name="column_681"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 681</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I can reassure the right reverend Prelate that we agree with him in terms of his assessment of the first pilot. Noble Lords will know that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales attended, and all who participated in the ceremony came away with very favourable recommendations. We are at the beginning of the process and I can assure noble Lords that we will continue to monitor piloted ceremonies to enable us to put in place the best possible system in the long term.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, the Minister will know that there has also been a ceremony held in Scotland which had due publicity in Glasgow. Can she tell the House what oath of loyalty to Her Majesty was taken at that ceremony? Was it the oath of loyalty printed in the Act, which the Government insisted should be the only one, or was it the oath which everyone else, including the judges, takes in Scotland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness will be amazed to know that, for once, I cannot answer her question. I shall write to her.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, further to the question of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, can the Minister confirm whether people seeking British citizenship will have to demonstrate an understanding not only of the English language but also of the United Kingdom's customs, history and culture before citizenship is granted?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the House will know that there was a recommendation in relation to five areas. We have accepted the Crick recommendations in relation to language. Noble Lords will know about level one and the progression from level one to level two to level three. We believe that there are important issues in terms of history and culture and we will be taking forward those matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the Government on implementing citizenship and on the Crick proposals we are discussing. Does the Minister accept that understanding is a two-way street and that the majority culture, if I may call it that, needs to understand a good deal more about incomers and their cultures? Does she further accept that the success so far of citizenship in schools is extremely patchy and that progress is, in many cases, very slow? Are the Government monitoring closely the development of citizenship in schools and have they any plans to help it on its way?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, we are developing the progress of citizenship in schools. It is very important for those of us in this country properly to understand our history. Many people do not understand the contribution made by those who came from the Commonwealth countries&#151;the Caribbean, India and Pakistan. They made a huge contribution to the wealth of this nation throughout the centuries and helped us to fight two world wars on a voluntary and <P>

<a name="40427-02_head0"></a><H3><center>Multiculturalism</center></H3>
<P>

<a name="40427-02_time0"></a><H5>2.50 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Chan </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether, in the light of the recent statement by the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, they consider that a new approach to the concept of multiculturalism is required.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the Government believe in integration with diversity. That means both breaking down the barriers to, and positively promoting, integration, including working with communities to face down racism and other forms of extremism. They agree with the chairman of the CRE that everyone should be able to feel part of Britain and that their culture is valued and respected.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Chan: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that very helpful and encouraging reply. With regard to the issue of integration and feeling part of the country, would she not agree that employment is a very important aspect? Therefore, is she not dismayed to read of recent studies that show that the unemployment rates for Bangladeshis, Pakistanis and Caribbean people is somewhere between two and a half to four times higher than those for the general population?
<P>

<a name="40427-02_para0"></a>With that in mind, I want to congratulate Her Majesty's Government on putting into place the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. As a result, all the statutory bodies that are signed up must have race equality schemes and ensure that they are implemented. To what extent have the Government been able to find out about the usefulness of race equality schemes in terms of employment and retention at work?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Chan, about the importance of employment. It is true that we are distressed that there appears to be a disproportionate approach to unemployment. The Government, through the measures mentioned by the noble Lord, such as the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 and others, are doing everything that we can to address the issue of inequality to ensure that there is a greater parity of treatment, and that any unfair discrimination is eradicated. We are continuing to do that across the piece of government activity, and monitoring as we go.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister agree that the differentials in employment are not unconnected with the differentials in educational achievement that we discussed in the first Question?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, can I say "Yes and no"? One of the issues that has been raised is <P>


<a name="column_683"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 683</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether those with similar educational attainment are given similar opportunities. Even when those from BME communities have similar educational attainments or exceed the norm, there is a question mark as to whether they are treated equally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew14"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Chester: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister agree that it is perfectly possible to be enthusiastically British and yet also to support a different cricket team when it is engaged in a test match with England, provided that when England plays another country that person supports England itself? I notice that my Scottish friends find that insight hard to accept sometimes. Would it not be the true interpretation of multiculturalism that one can be culturally bilingual and entirely British in the process?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I certainly agree with the right reverend Prelate that one can enthusiastically support another country when it is playing Britain but then against all others Britain comes first. There are real benefits in celebrating diversity. I reiterate what I said in answer to the last Question: we in Britain have always had a diverse community, and we are, I hope, learning to celebrate it more easily now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, from these Benches, I assure the Minister of our full support for Trevor Phillips and his leadership of the CRE. Following on from what the right reverend Prelate has just said, did the Minister read in this morning's Guardian about Mr Sajid Mahmood, aged 22, who has just come back from a family wedding in Pakistan? Mr Mahmood has been watching Lancashire league cricket with his dad since he was five, joined the Lancashire team when he was 17, and his ambition, once he gets his bowling speed up to 100 miles an hour, is to play for England. Is that not a true reflection of 21st century Britain&#151;and should we not all thank God that he was not born in Yorkshire?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, in relation to the Yorkshire/Lancashire question, I shall be truly British and say nothing. The noble Lord has given us an exemplar from which we can understand that we can cull the benefit of the rich variety that is now ours, to make Britain the very best that it can be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, nevertheless, do the Government not agree with Mr Phillips' recent statement that we should assert a core of Britishness rather than go on about multiculturalism?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, there are core British values. The point made by Mr Phillips was that multiculturalism has been interpreted by some to mean separatism. That is the difficulty. Language mutates; as an example, most of us in our generation would say that "bad" means "not good", but that is not an interpretation shared by the younger generation, who say that "bad" and "wicked" mean <P>


<a name="column_684"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 684</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>good things and not bad things. That is what has happened to multiculturalism&#151;it has come to mean separatism as opposed to integration with diversity.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Blackwell: </B>   My Lords, does it follow from what the Minister said that the Government support the concept of a strong sense of nationhood as underpinning a stable and confident society? Would she therefore accept that nothing should be done in the name of multiculturalism to suppress that sense of national pride, however much we accept and take pride in different cultures?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I know an EU question cunningly disguised when I hear it! I can certainly say to the noble Lord that we are very proud of a nation that is multicultural and diverse, and that this Government will always protect what is quintessentially British.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, while we welcome the very responsible initiatives by the Muslim Council of Britain, can the Minister tell the House what steps have been taken to counter the serious hate campaign, particularly among third-generation Muslims? An example of that was the recent burning of the Union flag in Regent's Park.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, we have had outreach programmes on a whole series of issues, not only by the Home Office but also by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I can certainly assure noble Lords that the sort of behaviour that the noble Lord described is, as he indicated, not supported by the majority of the Muslim community. There is a small section of all our community that is dysfunctional in the way in which it expresses itself. It would be a very sad day if we equated that with the majority&#151;it is a minority view.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, as CPA order 17 makes clear, investigations of wrongdoing are the responsibility of the country of origin of the individuals concerned. Her Majesty's Government take very seriously the allegations of torture, deliberate destruction of property and killing of unarmed civilians. When allegations concern United Kingdom personnel, in the first instance a senior officer considers whether the appropriate rules <P>


<a name="column_685"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 685</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of engagement have been applied. If he or she is not satisfied, an independent investigation is carried out. When UK personnel are found to have broken the law, appropriate disciplinary measures will be taken, including criminal proceedings when necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the Minister for that detailed reply. Does she agree that the use of collective punishment, such as the demolition of houses and the heavy use of retaliation against civilian insurgents, such as the use of tanks and helicopter gunships, is clearly contrary to the fourth Geneva Convention of which the United Kingdom is a signatory? Can she also tell the House whether the United Kingdom has asked for any review of the tactics being used at the present time against insurgent civilians, given that the experience of the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland, painfully learnt, is that restraint is very helpful indeed in gaining support and winning hearts and minds? Can she confirm that we are drawing the attention of our American allies to this somewhat more restrained approach?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I agree that the use of collective punishment and the disproportionate use of force against civilians are wrong. I agree with the noble Baroness unequivocally on both points. The noble Baroness asked me about reviews of tactics. The review of tactics or rules of engagement, call them what you will, is something to which this Government pay a great deal of attention. Your Lordships will know that our rules of engagement are referred the Attorney-General to make sure that they are consistent with our international obligations. Of course we believe that the United States of America has similar obligations. In preparing for this Question, I asked about the position of the United States. I am told that the United States has confirmed that all reports of detainee abuse by US personnel are taken seriously, that all allegations of mistreatment are investigated and that an investigation of six US personnel is currently under way. There have been two investigations in relation to United Kingdom personnel.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that all civilian deaths in Iraq are deeply regrettable and that every effort must be made to avoid them? But will she join me in paying tribute to our excellent Armed Forces in Iraq, whose professionalism, restraint and experience have done so much to minimise Iraqi casualties and to help to improve their situation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I agree with that unequivocally. I accept that the allegations in this report are very serious and that they must be investigated properly, in the way that I have indicated to your Lordships, but the fact is that some 60,000 British troops have served in Iraq in the past year. It is overwhelmingly clear that 99 times out of 100&#151;999 times out of 1,000&#151;the behaviour of our troops has been exemplary. I have visited the troops, both under General Lamb and under General Stewart. Whatever the seriousness of these allegations, which <P>


<a name="column_686"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 686</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be dealt with properly and in the way that I have described, they must not obscure the record of the overwhelming majority of British troops who have been a credit to this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that policing by Arabic-speaking police officers and the disarmament of the civilian population are key issues underlying the present troubles? Can she give us any good news about those two points?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I do not entirely agree. It is not just a question of speaking Arabic. The noble Lord must understand the way in which Iraqi society has been riven by internal strife between Shia and Sunni and the terrible legacy that some senior officers of the Ba'ath Party brought to bear. I think that we all agree that the wholesale dismissal of members of the Ba'ath Party, not only in the police but in other parts of public life, was rather more thorough than it might have been.
<P>

<a name="40427-03_para0"></a>The key to this is not just speaking Arabic; it is also proper training; for example, understanding that it is quite inappropriate for troops to take a dog into a Muslim house in search of weapons or whatever because it is wholly out of keeping with Islamic convictions. The noble Lord asked how the training is progressing. It is going well. It is going on in Jordan and in different parts of Iraq. There are now more than 50,000 police and we are seeing increasing numbers of people in the armed forces. There is no shortage of willing recruits among Iraqis to join the security services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree with the views expressed by former UK diplomats that, at the very least, the number of Iraqi casualties should be counted? What message does she think that the fact that they are not counted sends? In addition, can she say whether the terms of engagement of coalition forces in Iraq have been published? If not, will they be published?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, on the noble Baroness's final point, the answer is "no". We will not publish the terms of engagement. The noble Baroness will know that we never publish terms of engagement because to do so would endanger our troops. She will find that that point has consistently been made. The security of our own troops must come first.
<P>

<a name="40427-03_para1"></a>On the point made in the letter from the 52 former diplomats, I wish that we could count civilian casualties. I genuinely wish that that were the case. We have done our best to count them but I am bound to say to the noble Baroness that the practicalities involved are very difficult indeed. Certainly during the early part of the engagement, it has not always been possible to know what civilian casualties there were on the ground. If the noble Baroness were to use her imagination, she would realise that one does not know who has been hurt by shells fired from several miles away. We do our best to count civilian casualties now. <P>


<a name="column_687"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 687</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I agree with the noble Baroness that this is very important. I wish that we could do more. I know that the Prime Minister is very concerned about this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, would not the earliest possible transfer of responsibility for security to the interim authority that is to be set up in June avoid many of the incidents referred to in the report mentioned in the Question on the Order Paper? Is that not precisely what many members of the IGC want now, yet the Americans insist on rejecting it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I agree that it would be a very good thing to transfer responsibility for as much security as possible but the key to the noble Lord's question is in those very words, "as much as security as possible". I know that the noble Lord's Iraqi contacts are extremely good and he will know that the Iraqis are the first to say, "Please do not take the security of coalition forces from Iraq too soon". It is enormously important that coalition forces stay.
<P>

<a name="40427-03_para2"></a>The allegations in these reports are very serious but the majority of the allegations are not about British personnel. We do not have the power to investigate other allegations but we urge countries whose nationals are accused to make their own investigations. The noble Lord referred to the allegations as though the report was full of them. It is not. It is full of general points with two specific allegations, which have been investigated. It is enormously important that, if people know about incidents that need to be investigated, we must know what those allegations are and have the specifics. Then we are able to follow up with the kind of investigations that I detailed in my first Answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams.

<A NAME="40427-04_spmin0"></A><B> The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton):</B>  My Lords, the rule of law is fundamental to our constitutional democracy and must be safeguarded accordingly. This Government have always strongly defended the rule of law and will continue to do so. Given this responsibility, the Government are not in the same position as other litigants who are entirely free to express views about decisions against them. But the Government are entitled to disagree with <P>


<a name="column_688"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 688</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>particular decisions, both in Parliament and as part of our wider executive responsibilities, without undermining in any way judicial independence and the rule of law. I have discussed the approach that I have set out with my right honourable friend the Home Secretary and the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice. We all agree that this is the right approach.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for that careful, considered and helpful reply. This is not the first occasion on which the present Home Secretary has made an instant and angry attack on a judicial decision without, of course, the judge having any opportunity to reply. He did so in an asylum case early last year. If the noble and learned Lord has further discussions with the Home Secretary, will he bring home to him, in addition to the helpful formula about which he told us, how harmful it is to the rule of law to make such attacks? Would he look favourably on an amendment to Clause 1 of his Constitutional Reform Bill to make it clear that his duty and that of any successor will be not only to guarantee judicial independence but to secure and maintain the rule of law?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I think that the line that must be drawn is between legitimate disagreement, which is plainly permissible even for the Government, as long as it is measured, and something that is intemperate and undermines the rule of law. In the light of remarks that have been made, I have closely considered the detail and am quite satisfied that my right honourable friend was measured in what he said. One must be careful to distinguish what he said from what else was said about the issue by other people. As far as I am concerned, he was measured in his response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, should we not take comfort, however small, from the fact that the Home Secretary seems, if he is correctly reported, to wish to have access to the courts&#151;the Court of Appeal in particular&#151;rather than seeking to oust the jurisdiction of that court, as was attempted in Clause 14 of the recent Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, it is important to stress two things. In all my right honourable friend's remarks, he has made it absolutely clear that the court that made the decision is a superior court of record and we have, as a matter of legislation, decided that it should make the decision. We fully accept that. He quite legitimately raises the issue of whether there should be appeal to a higher court, and that can be considered by this House by way of amendment to a Bill currently before the House. I believe that to be a responsible approach, because it is permissible, as long as it is done in a temperate way, to disagree with the decisions of the court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, does my noble and learned friend recall that my noble and learned friend the <P>


<a name="column_689"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 689</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>former Lord Chancellor suggested that Ministers should normally refrain from cheering those decisions of which they approve and booing those which they dislike? But would it not be a counsel of perfection to expect a Minister never to criticise a decision of the courts that seems to him to frustrate the policy for which he is responsible to Parliament and to the people? Surely, that is nothing to do with any attack on the rule of law, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Lester.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the broad approach proposed by my noble friend Lord Borrie. In the case that we are talking about, quite legitimately, the Home Office made submissions which the court was quite entitled to reject. It is obvious from that that the Home Office took a particular view, but it fully accepts that the decision is ultimately for the courts. It inherently disagrees with the approach taken, but it both accepts the authority of the court&#151;as it must because of the rule of law&#151;and raises the question of whether we should amend an Act of Parliament to allow an appeal. With respect, I believe that to be a perfectly legitimate response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-04_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord agree that there is an issue here that we all need to consider? It has to do with the culture of public criticism in which we live and in which an absence of restraint has its own dangers. It is perfectly clear that people who hold privileged positions have to have regard to the fact of their position in deciding what to say. Is it not possible that if unrestrained criticism of judgments becomes fashionable, the judiciary may start to arrogate to itself the right of reply? In that case, does not the abyss open up of a society that cannot distinguish between a judgment and a political speech? Does the noble and learned Lord agree that we all have the responsibility to exercise such restraint as will prevent that happening?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I agree with what the right reverend Prelate says. As I said in my initial reply, I believe that the Government are in a wholly different position from that of other people. Private citizens are entitled to criticise judgments with less restraint than the Government. The Government have a responsibility, which my right honourable friend the Home Secretary accepts, only to disagree and not to do anything that could undermine the rule of law. That must be the approach, because the dangers identified by the right reverend Prelate plainly exist otherwise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind the importance of the principle of the separation of powers, to which the Government attach great importance in their current proposals for constitutional reform; and bearing in mind the concordat recently achieved between the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice, restraining the intrusion of the judiciary into legislative and executive <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>matters; does the noble and learned Lord not think that the time has come for him to conclude a similar concordat with the Home Secretary, restraining the Home Secretary from intruding into matters that are properly the province of the judiciary?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that the noble Lord said that, because, as I said, the approach I set out, which is the right approach for the Government to take in commenting on decisions, is agreed between me, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary and the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice. So there is agreement, the noble Lord will be glad to hear.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 17, line 2, after "religion" insert "or belief"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-04_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40427-04_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: This group of amendments all address one point; namely, to bring the Bill into line with the Human Rights Act 1998, and specifically Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, to which the UK is a signatory. There is an even more recent precedent in the title of the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations. I remind your Lordships that the Communications Act 2003 was amended in Committee by the Government to change "religion" to "religion and other beliefs". That amendment, like these amendments, was encouraged by the British Humanist Association, of which I am a member. I thank that association for its help. The point of inserting "belief", as the Committee will know, is because, in international treaty language as well as case law, it is that word&#151;to cite the authoritative United Nations Human Rights Committee&#151;which protects,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-04_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40427-04_para13"></a>However, the amendment is not just there for consistency, although consistency is a reputable aim. It is there because there are states which persecute their citizens because they do not profess a religious belief, usually that associated with the state. People have been condemned to death for that reason. It was once so in this country, so we cannot shrug our shoulders about it. So belief needs to be explicit in the statute as a recognised ground of persecution, otherwise there will be the odd and grossly unjust situation that people persecuted for their atheistic or humanistic beliefs would be treated differently by this Government from those persecuted for their religious beliefs.
<P>

<a name="40427-04_para14"></a>Some may say that, because the Refugee Convention and previous immigration and asylum legislation use the term "religion" with no addition of "or belief", we should remain with that wording. But the whole point of the thinking behind the Human Rights Act is that procedures should be reinterpreted with human rights in mind. The admirable House of Commons research paper 3/88 of December 2003, which states that human rights law should be taken into account throughout the immigration and asylum process, specifically mentions Article 9 of the <P>


<a name="column_692"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 692</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>European Convention on Human Rights, which covers freedom of thought and conscience as well as religion.
<P>

<a name="40427-04_para15"></a>Sometimes it is argued by lawyers that the term "religion" encompasses belief of a non-religious nature. That may well be how the term is understood by lawyers; or, indeed, the agents of persecution can be motivated by religious motives and thus the non-believing victim is persecuted on grounds of religion, even if not his. I am nevertheless convinced that we should have law that is readily understood by everyone. Those for whom it is intended are not exclusively lawyers, but asylum seekers and all who want to know what grounds of persecution may be taken into account. If we add the words "or belief" we will have sent out an unequivocal signal that it is all forms of religion and belief which are protected under the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-05_spnew0"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Chester: </B>   We on these Benches have no problem with the arguments put forward by the noble Baroness, subject to what we will hear from the Minister. It is interesting that the first use of "Christian" derived from Christians being regarded as atheists by the conventional authorities in Antioch.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para0"></a> If I heard the noble Baroness correctly, a better formulation might be "religion, belief or unbelief", rather than simply "belief", as she referred specifically to those who had no belief. However, we think that her points are probably covered under proposed new paragraphs (f) and (h), so it may not be necessary to make the change suggested. If we understand the thrust of all the categories, there need to be identifiable groups of people involved. Perhaps that means some sort of organisation or corporate recognition required with the group concerned, rather than simply individual beliefs or unbeliefs.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para1"></a>In general terms, we are entirely supportive of the comments made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   We also are sympathetic to the ideas that motivate the noble Baroness in tabling the amendment, although we are not convinced with the right reverend Prelate that it is absolutely necessary. Clause 15 allows the Secretary of State to certify as clearly unfounded, and therefore ineligible for an in-country appeal, any claim from applicants relying on Section 92(1) of the 2002 Act who are refused a certificate of entitlement under Section 10 of the Act, or refused variation of leave to enter or remain if the result is that the person has no leave to enter or remain or if that leave is varied but, when the variation takes effect, the person has no leave to enter or remain.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para2"></a>The clause then extends the order-making power in Section 94 of the 2002 Act, so that the Secretary of State can add parts of states to the list of states from which an asylum seeker's claim is automatically deemed to be clearly unfounded. He can also specify descriptions of persons who are at no serious risk of persecution in particular states or parts of states, and there is a list of characteristics to be covered by the description.
<P>


<a name="column_693"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="40427-05_para3"></a>The Explanatory Notes state that proposed new subsection (5C) gives only:

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Examples of what might constitute a 'description of person'",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-05_para4"></a>
indicating that the list is not intended to be exhaustive. The subsection concludes with,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(h) any other attribute or circumstance that the Secretary of State thinks appropriate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-05_para5"></a>
That would obviously include "belief" if it were not already covered by "religion", which may be what the noble Baroness seeks to achieve.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para6"></a> Whether or not the amendment is accepted, it would be possible for the Secretary of State to make an order relating to persons who do not call their belief systems a religion. However, that could be the least of the problems with the exercise of the powers. If the Secretary of State certifies that part of a state is safe for a certain description of person, an applicant may have other characteristics not covered by the description that make it dangerous for him. For instance, a person's sexual orientation, which is not on the list, might put him at risk if he belongs to a religion considered immune from persecution in a particular state. The Secretary of State might say that it is perfectly safe to send a Muslim back to Saudi Arabia, but what if he is gay?
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para7"></a>The problem with the whole formula is that it does not catch only the persons who base their claims on the characteristics in the description of person to whom the order applies. The Secretary of State has only to be satisfied under proposed new subsection (5B) that the person falls within the description for him to be deprived of his in-country right of appeal, whatever the ingredients of his claim and even if the description had no relevance whatever to his reasons for fearing persecution.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para8"></a> I am glad that the noble Baroness tabled the amendment because, although I am not troubled by the omission of "belief", I am concerned that the effect of denying particular classes of persons the right of in-country appeal may lead to injustice. I ask the Minister to amend proposed new subsection (5B) so that the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the claimant falls within the description, but that the claimant's fear of persecution was based on his possession of one or more of the characteristics cited in the description and not wholly or partly on his membership of some other class of persons covered by the Refugee Convention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I would like to give two examples of where there has been considerable argument and doubt about whether something is a religion or not. The first is Buddhism, on which there can be arguments either way. As for Falun Gong, it is quite clear that its followers have suffered and still suffer terrible persecutions in China. There again, whether it constitutes a religion may be in considerable doubt. Some would describe it as a reformulation of ancient traditions and practices.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para9"></a>The wording of proposed new subsection (5C)(h) in Clause 15, which is on page 17, may almost be too wide and give too much discretion to a future Secretary of State. It might be better to rely on the wording contained in the international convention on refugees.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I thank my noble friend Lady Whitaker for raising this issue. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is correct in relation to this amendment not being necessary. In view of his comments&#151;much of which I agree with in relation to the way in which Clause 15 works&#151;it will be helpful if I explain a little more fully the framework into which it sits, because I do not agree with him entirely. I hope that I will be able to reassure the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester that the concerns that he may have about my noble friend's anxieties are also not well founded.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para10"></a>Clause 15, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, provides for a modest extension of the powers in Section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, under which a state, or part of a state, can be designated if certain conditions are met. These are that there is in general no serious risk of persecution of those entitled to reside in that state, and that removal of a person entitled to reside there would not in general contravene our ECHR obligations. Since Section 94 came into force, 14 states have been designated by order under this provision. These are in addition to the 10 EU accession states included on the face of the 2002 Act, and due to be removed by Clause 15(4) of the present Bill to reflect their joining the EU.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para11"></a>Designating a country does not mean that a person's asylum or human rights claim will not be considered on its merits. Every case is given an individual assessment, taking account of all relevant facts. Where a claim is refused, it must be certified as clearly unfounded unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that it is not. Such a certificate prevents a person lodging an appeal until they leave the United Kingdom. That is the framework.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para12"></a>We consider that these provisions have been working well to date. Clause 15 enables a country or part-country to be designated for the purpose of Section 94 in respect of a description of persons, where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the Refugee Convention and the ECHR tests I have just described apply to the description of person in the country in question.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para13"></a> This provision would inject some further flexibility into the Section 94 powers. Where we do not consider that the two-part test set out in Section 94 is met when taking all the population of a given country together, there may be occasions where it would be useful to designate that country for a specified group or groups of persons for whom that test is met. The purpose of the power is to designate a group for the purpose of Section 94, and the non-suspensive appeals certification is to identify the groups for whom the country is generally safe. That is the way in which it looks.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para14"></a>As with every case, if a person falling within a designated group claimed asylum, we would give individual consideration. The new subsection (5C) inserted into Section 94 by Clause 15 provides what a "description of person" may refer to. We have listed seven specific examples of "attributes or <P>


<a name="column_695"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 695</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances" we think are most likely to be relevant to this particular power, and then added a final category covering
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any other attributes or circumstance that the Secretary of State considers appropriate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-05_para15"></a><P>

<a name="40427-05_para16"></a>Contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury fears, this is not supposed to undermine but should actually give greater security for individuals. Turning to the amendment, it seeks to expand the fourth such description, "religion", so that it reads "religion or belief".
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para17"></a>If this amendment were to have any practical effect, it would be&#151;if I may most respectfully say so to my noble friend&#151;marginally to increase the flexibility of the clause by, for example, enabling a country to be designated safe for those of its residents who held a particular non-religious belief, where members of that group met the two-part test of Section 94.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para18"></a>We have no problem in principle with this amendment since it is not inconsistent with the purpose of Clause 15, namely to identify categories of people who, in general, may be safer or less safe than other residents in a given country. However, we do not think the amendment is necessary because the existing wording&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has already indicated&#151;is sufficient to capture a description of a person defined by their belief. The term "religion" may itself cover such beliefs, particularly beliefs such as aethism. It is not just a view of lawyers&#151;that is the view of others as well.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para19"></a>The noble Baroness may be pleased to note that the EU Qualification Directive, to which the United Kingdom will be a party, and to which we have already given political assent, will include the following in Article 12 on the reasons for prosecution:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The concept of religion shall in particular include the holding of theistic, non-theistic and athestic beliefs, the participation in, or abstention from, formal worship in private or in community with others.".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-05_para20"></a>
This wording is, we think, close to the spirit of Article 9 of the ECHR.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para21"></a>For any recognisable beliefs not caught by the "religion" category, other categories listed in subection (5C) are very likely to cover them, in particular category (f), which is:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"membership of a social or other group,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-05_para22"></a>
category (g),
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para23"></a>
and category (h),

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any other attribute or circumstance that the Secretary of State thinks appropriate.".

So, in relation to the Falun Gong, who are an identifiable group, it would be perfectly possible to argue that they would fall within the framework of the definition currently given.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para25"></a>We have not been attracted to the idea of adding the reference to "belief", as suggested by the particular amendments in relation to Schedule 3, because it refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-05_para26"></a>
using the exact wording of the Refugee Convention. It must be wise to stick to those words because the parts of the schedule to which the amendments refer relate to countries that are safe on Refugee Convention grounds. In other words, an individual will not face prosecution there for a convention reason. Adding to&#151;or indeed making any change to&#151;the wording used in the Refugee Convention would mean that the test in Schedule 3 no longer fitted 100 per cent the relevant requirements of the convention. That is clearly, I hope the Committee will agree, not appropriate in this case.
<P>

<a name="40427-05_para27"></a>However, I would like to reassure my noble friend that any concerns about the existing wording which may have prompted these amendments are more illusory than real, and for similar reasons to those just given in connection with Clause 15. As I stated, the term "religion" may itself cover beliefs which would encompass humanism and atheism. For these reasons, we do not consider these proposed amendments to be appropriate or necessary in this schedule. I hope from this my noble friend can feel comforted that her concerns are fully met, and those of the British Humanist Association will also, similarly, be met.

<A NAME="40427-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Harrison: </B>   First, I apologise for not being present at the beginning of this debate. I ask clarification from the noble Baroness on the point that she made at the end there. Does she agree with me that it flies in the face of reason and any proper understanding of the English language&#151;which we in this Chamber were talking about earlier&#151;to confuse the concept of religion with that of atheism? I even look to the Benches near me for confirmation of that. However it is read by the general public, if you are to say that something is done in the name of religion, most of us would associate that idea with some kind of religious belief in respect of a god and so on. It certainly would not encompass the concept of those who profess atheism. I ask the Minister to clarify that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hope that I have made clear that the way in which relgious belief has been interpreted has encompassed those of no belief. I think it is right. I do not know whether my noble friend was present when the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester rightly reminded us that in the past, those who held Christian beliefs were said to be atheist because they did not believe as others did in terms of Judaism. They believed that Christ was the son of God, which for some was a real cult of atheism.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I hope that I have dealt with the matter to the noble Lord's satisfaction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   The Minister did not satisfy me on one question I raised; that is, what would happen in the case of a person who came within the "description of a person" but whose asylum claim was not based on his possession of that characteristic? I gave the example of a Muslim who was to be returned to a country where Islam was the religion but whose reason for his seeking asylum was that he was gay. In new subsection (5B) the only condition that has to be satisfied is that the Secretary of State must be sure that he is within that description and that he is entitled to reside in "the State or part".
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para2"></a> Therefore, in that case, the Secretary of State would be satisfied that the person was a Muslim and that it was safe for Muslims in that country; and would sign a certificate even though the reason for applying for asylum in Britain was nothing to do with religion. That may be a defect in the wording, but I am asking only for the noble Baroness to look at the provision. If I am right about the drafting, I ask her to put it in a different form of words so that the Secretary of State does not have to exercise that power when the reason for applying for asylum was totally different from the "description of person" to which the category applied.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I answered the noble Lord by making two points. First, the purpose of the power to designate a group for the purposes of Section 94 non-suspensive appeals is to identify a group for whom a country is generally safe. As with every case, if a person falling within a designated group claimed asylum, we would give individual consideration to the merits of the claim. The claim would not be refused automatically. If a person could show a well founded fear, we would not remove him. I think I said that twice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-06_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Whitaker: </B>   I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate from all sides of the Committee. Perhaps I may say briefly to the right reverent Prelate the Bishop of Chester&#151;I am extremely grateful for his support&#151;that non-belief is not added to religion or belief only because international treaty language uses the words "religion or belief" and international case law glosses that as including all forms of belief, including non-belief. This is my attempt to go by the wording of the rule of law.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para3"></a>I have sympathy with the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. It is of primary importance to ensure that the law makes it unequivocally clear that freedom of all kinds of belief is entirely protected. Therefore, I find the response of my noble friend the Minister some comfort. I shall read her words extremely carefully. I am not sure that we have the confidence that the law is as clear and comprehensive as it ought to be, but for the time being, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40427-06_para6"></a>Clause 16 [Appeal from within United Kingdom]:
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para7"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 16 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I seek to oppose Clause 16 standing part of the Bill. Part 5 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 sharply restricted the right of in-country appeals. That was highly controversial during the debates on the Bill because appeals from outside the country after removal are much less likely to succeed. In some cases, perhaps only a few, the appellant will be unable to proceed because he is imprisoned, or worse, in the country to which he has been returned. In many cases, the appellants are likely to have great difficulty in communicating with those representing them at the hearing of the appeal, which will undoubtedly reduce their chances of succeeding on appeal.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para8"></a>Section 92 of the 2002 Act prohibits in-country appeals under Section 82. The appellant must leave the United Kingdom before he or she can appeal. Section 92(2) does, however, contain a number of exemptions. Section 92(2) permits in-country appeals from certain categories of decisions, and is not altered by Clause 16 of the Bill. Section 92(3), however, is altered. At present, that subparagraph permits in-country appeals if the appellant is in the United Kingdom and has received entry clearance, or holds a work permit. Clause 16 will amend Section 92 so as to restrict that right. Clause 16 excludes from in-country appeals against a deemed refusal under paragraph 2(9) of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971, for example, where an immigration officer believes that leave has been obtained by false information or non-disclosure of material facts.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para9"></a>Clause 16 will also restrict appeals where leave to enter has been refused because the immigration officer believes that leave was sought for a purpose other than that which was specified in the entry clearance previously obtained. Clause 16 will further limit the right of in-country appeal by those who are in the United Kingdom and have a work permit to people with some form of British nationality.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para10"></a>Clause 16 was added at Report stage in the House of Commons and was not debated at all there, so this is the first occasion on which either House of Parliament has had an opportunity to consider it. The result is that people who have obtained an entry clearance from one immigration officer, have paid for that clearance and, in many cases, will have incurred travelling costs in order to come to the UK in expectation of admission, may be turned away because the immigration officer who interviews them on arrival takes a different view from the officer who originally gave them entry clearance.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para11"></a>That is unlikely to affect many people, but it will have a severe effect on those who are caught by the amendment. The number of in-country appeals is in fact already small. In 2002, out of 84,000 appeals dealt with, only 3,600 were non-asylum in-country appeals to which Clause 16 might apply. Even under Clause 16, many appeals will continue to be dealt with in-country, <P>


<a name="column_699"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 699</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>so that at most this Clause 16 will affect only a few hundred people. It appears to us to be an unnecessary and petty restriction that should not have been included in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para12"></a>I would also make the further point in connection with the new subsection 3D of Section 92 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which is inserted by Clause 16, that there appears to me to be a distinct possibility that the limitation of the right of in-country appeal to people with work permits who have some nationality link with the United Kingdom contravenes Articles 6 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. I wonder therefore whether the Government are satisfied with the compatibility of that particular amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-06_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Of course, I understand what the noble Lord says in relation to compatibility. We are clear that these provisions are indeed compatible. There is nothing sinister in the proposal to limit appeal rights in the circumstances set out in Clause 16.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para13"></a>As the noble Lord says, Clause 16 replaces Section 92(3) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. It removes the work permit holders from the general provision, giving rise to an in-country right of appeal. The provision of appeal rights to those holding entry clearance or a work permit is historical, and harks back to the time when there were fewer visa nationals, and most holders of entry clearance had sought, when not required to do so, to find out in advance if they were eligible to enter the United Kingdom in the capacity for which the entry clearance was sought. It seemed right in those circumstances to provide an in-country appeal if, for whatever reason, the immigration officer refused leave to enter on arrival. But times have moved on, as I am sure noble Lords accept. There are many more visa nationals who must hold entry clearance, and it is now inappropriate to afford them such special treatment.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para14"></a>The purpose of Clause 16 is to prevent possible abuse in cases where an individual has entry clearance but then seeks to enter the United Kingdom for a purpose which is not that for which the entry clearance was issued. Where such a person is refused leave to enter the United Kingdom, they will not benefit from an in-country right of appeal. Therefore, any appeal against a refusal of leave to enter will be exercisable only from outside the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para15"></a>Clause 16, as I am sure noble Lords will remember, works in conjunction with Clause 13, which gives immigration officers the power to examine an entry clearance holder, to establish whether leave to enter should be cancelled on the grounds that the holder is seeking to enter for a purpose other than that specified in the entry clearance. I should emphasise that all applications for asylum, whether or not these are made by an entry clearance holder, are considered carefully on their merits, and that this provision will not affect that. If an asylum application is made by an entry <P>


<a name="column_700"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 700</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clearance holder that is not clearly unfounded but is still refused, an in-country right of appeal will still exist.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para16"></a>Clause 16 also removes the right to an in-country right of appeal for those persons who hold a work permit. This will not affect most work permit holders, as it is now a requirement that any holder of a work permit for more than six months' duration must also hold an entry clearance. Holders of other immigration employment documents, such as seasonal agricultural workers, those on the sector-based scheme and the highly skilled migrants programme must hold entry clearance, whatever the length of their planned stay. So unless leave to enter is sought for a changed purpose, the holder of an immigration employment document would have an in-country right of appeal if refused entry, by virtue of having entry clearance. However, in the interests of consistency, it is necessary to alter the right to an in-country appeal for the holders of work permits, in order that similar rights to an appeal are available to the majority of those who have obtained prior entry clearance. This change will only affect non-visa nationals who hold a visa permit of six months or less and who are refused leave to enter the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para17"></a> Specified British nationals who do not have a right to abode in the UK will continue to benefit from the same in-country right of appeal as they currently have under Section 92(3). That means they will retain their in-country right of appeal against a refusal of leave to enter where they hold a work permit at the time of removal, regardless of whether they also hold entry clearance. The specified British nationals, under the meaning of the British Nationality Act 1981, are as follows: British Overseas Territories citizens, British overseas citizens, British nationals overseas, British protected persons, and British subjects. These persons have been exempted from the proposed change to prevent further erosion of their status. We believe that we have a particular responsibility to these groups, and that it is consistent with that responsibility that their entitlement not be reduced. Their rights of appeal from within the United Kingdom remain as set out on the face of the 2002 Act.
<P>

<a name="40427-06_para18"></a>I hope the noble Lord will be satisfied that we are not actually doing anything terribly wrong in this Clause.

<A NAME="40427-06_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am inclined to agree with what the noble Baroness has said, much though I sympathise with the noble Lord who opposed the Clause. The noble Lord mentioned the European Convention on Human Rights in support of his remarks. We should bear in mind that, although that convention has had great support on both sides of the House, especially the government side, it was conceived years ago, before we had the peril of terrorism. We must now look at it in the light of that peril.

<FONT SIZE=3>Rights applied solely, as regards those who hold work permits, to the distinction drawn between those who have some form of British nationality and those who do not. I remain unconvinced by the noble Baroness's argument that there is adequate ground for distinguishing between those categories and treating them differently. However, in due course, that matter may have to be tested in the courts.
<P>

<a name="40427-07_para0"></a>The more the noble Baroness spoke, the more convinced I became that Clause 16 would affect only a small number of people and was therefore unnecessary.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-07_para3"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "SUSPECTED INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST: BAIL
<br>
(1) At the end of section 24 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c. 24) (suspected international terrorist: bail by Special Immigration Appeals Commission) add&#151; 
<br>
"(4) Where the Special Immigration Appeals Commission determines an application for bail, the applicant or a person who made representations to the Commission about the application may appeal on a question of law to the appropriate appeal court.
<br>
(5) Section 7(2) and (3) of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 (c. 68) (appeals from Commission) shall have effect for the purposes of an appeal under subsection (4) above."
<br>
(2) In section 27(5) and (6) of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c. 24) (suspected international terrorist: Special Immigration Appeals Commission: procedure) for "section 25 or 26 of this Act" substitute "section 24, 25 or 26 of this Act"."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-07_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: As the Committee will be aware, under Part 4 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 my right honourable friend has the power to issue a certificate in respect of a person if he reasonably suspects that that person is a terrorist and that his or her presence in the United Kingdom is a threat to national security. The effect of certification is that the person concerned can be detained under Immigration Act powers even though our international obligations or practical considerations mean that there is no immediate prospect of their being removed.
<P>

<a name="40427-07_para5"></a>A person who has been certified can appeal to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) against that certification. Separately, a person detained as a suspected international terrorist in reliance on the powers contained in Part 4 may be released on bail.
<P>

<a name="40427-07_para6"></a>Once SIAC has determined an appeal, there is the possibility of a further appeal on a point of law to the relevant court. In England and Wales this is the Court of Appeal; in Scotland it is the Court of Session; and in Northern Ireland it is the Court of Appeal in Northern <P>


<a name="column_702"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 702</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ireland. Those are also the courts that would consider appeals against determinations by SIAC in the commission's non-ATCSA cases.
<P>

<a name="40427-07_para7"></a>When SIAC allows the appeal against certification, the certificate must be cancelled and the person concerned is released. If the appeal is dismissed, the person remains in detention. Similarly, if bail is granted, the person is released. If the application is refused, he remains detained. However, whereas there is a further right of appeal in respect of the certification decision, there is no avenue of challenge in respect of the bail decision, even though the practical effect may be the same. Given that bail can be granted, and has been granted, where SIAC has been satisfied that the person concerned has been correctly certified&#151;that is to say, where the commission has accepted that the person concerned is a terrorist, and that he represents a risk to the national security of the UK&#151;the Government believe that there should be a mechanism to ensure that the law is applied correctly.
<P>

<a name="40427-07_para8"></a>Equally, although it is possible for a detainee simply to submit a further application for bail if his first application is refused, he has a right to expect that the law will be applied correctly, and the right to challenge the decision if he believes it has not.
<P>

<a name="40427-07_para9"></a>The clause will therefore create a right of appeal, again to the relevant court, and again limited to points of law in respect of SIAC's determinations on applications for bail by persons detained under the ATCSA. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am sure that this is an excellent amendment; I do not take issue with it. Increasingly, this Bill is drafted in terms of amendments to other statutes. The poor asylum seeker who must find his or her way through the law will find it quite impossible, even if a lawyer, to find out what are the possibilities&#151;whether bail or anything else. Will the Government consider producing a clear document in basic English to tell people exactly what their rights are in this respect? She probably will not want to give a definitive answer now. I must not go on asking questions that the noble Baroness cannot answer. I find it very difficult to understand a Bill drafted in this way, because I do not have all the other statutes in front of me; the asylum seeker will certainly not have those statutes. Will the noble Baroness comment on that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I warmly support what my noble friend has said. We ought to enact legislation in such a way that it will not be difficult for lay people to understand. Although one agrees in principle with the amendment that the noble Baroness has moved on behalf of the Government, it is strange that it amends previous legislation that amended legislation before that. If there could be consolidation as soon as possible, this important legislation could be more easily enforced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   I support that most wholeheartedly. When I heard of the recent case, which attracted a certain amount of publicity, my first <P>


<a name="column_703"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 703</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reaction was surprise that SIAC had power to grant bail. I thought that the history of the legislation was that appeals from SIAC were being confined continually, for reasons that do not matter. I had to try to work my way through all four statutes, which I found very difficult.
<P>

<a name="40427-07_para10"></a>My next surprise was being told that the Home Secretary had no right of appeal. It appears that that was right. The Home Secretary may be surprised that I wonder in this case whether it is right that his rights of appeal and the detainee's rights should be confined to issues of law. From a public perspective, the idea of someone who has been found by SIAC to be a danger to national security being allowed out on bail&#151;which, to the public, means free to walk the streets&#151;is so strange that public confidence would be improved if it were open to the Court of Appeal to do what it would have done in the last case&#151;namely, to ask, "What is the practical difference between this man being confined in Belmarsh Prison and his being under house arrest in his own home, subject to incredibly detailed and onerous conditions?" They may say that there is a difference. In that very unusual circumstance, the rule of law would be strengthened if the appeal were extended to questions of fact, notwithstanding the well-known ability of the courts to turn questions of fact into questions of law when it suits. I do not think that that should be overstrained.
<P>

<a name="40427-07_para11"></a>I do not think that we need consolidation. Those who come along the steady road of amending previously amended Acts should revoke the whole section and insert a completely new one. That avoids having to introduce consolidated legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Unless the Minister wishes to reply to the points that have been made, I shall speak now.
<P>

<a name="40427-07_para12"></a>Amendment No. 28A gives a right of appeal on a point of law to the losing party in a SIAC bail decision, whether the losing party is the detainee or the Home Secretary. That seems to be acceptable, though I have some reservations about going as far as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson of Lymington, in saying that it ought to be an appeal on the facts as well as on the law. I regard it as ironic that the Home Secretary, having tried to exclude judicial review of the decisions of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, now uses this Bill to introduce an appeal procedure when it suits him to do so.
<P>

<a name="40427-07_para13"></a>It is also regrettable that the Home Secretary chose to comment on last week's SIAC decision to grant bail, which led to this amendment. Those comments went beyond what was acceptable, in spite of the efforts to justify them made by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor about an hour ago in your Lordships' House. It could be said that following up these abusive comments with this distinctly modest amendment shows that the Home Secretary's bark is worse than his bite. That is not an adequate defence of the conduct of the Home Secretary. It is the barking, amplified by the tabloid press, that people will remember, not the absence of the bite.

<A NAME="40427-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I give full support from these Benches to the government amendments. Rather like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, I was a little taken aback, when I first read the Home Office letter on this subject, to find that there was no right of appeal against the granting of bail. It is not a matter that causes me concern&#151;I welcome the Government's move.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para0"></a>I want to consider carefully the point made by the noble and learned Lord as to whether the Government are being too narrow at this time, and grasping too little. From these Benches, I usually accuse them of grasping too much. Whether one ought to look at point of fact as well needs to be considered carefully. I agree with my noble friend Lady Carnegy that where there is such a series of substantial changes to complex legislation that affect people who are vulnerable, it is important that those changes are made as clear as possible. I am intrigued by the proposal made by the noble and learned Lord that good practice should be the withdrawal of a section and the rewriting, rather than this continual insertion of new clauses, bit by bit, to amend earlier legislation. I welcome the change, but I would welcome greater attention being paid in the future, by whoever is in government, to the clarity of presentation.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, tempts us into the realms of Clause 14, which would in normal circumstances have been before us today. He is absolutely right to do so. He mentions the irony of the fact that here we have an appeal, and yet in other parts of the Bill we know that the Home Secretary was somewhat loath to have a full appeals process. Certainly, I understand that the usual channels have been in careful negotiation on this issue. I am also aware that because it is the usual channels, I must not say anything on the Floor of the Committee. I invite the Minister to tell us the latest headline news, if headlines there be.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   That is a temptation that I regret I must resist, for the same reason that the noble Baroness could not be tempted into commenting. The usual channels are dealing with this matter. I know that all Members of this House want us to get these amendments right, and the usual channels will be anxious to ensure that all noble Lords who need to see these amendments will get them at the earliest possible moment, as soon as we can practicably arrange for that. I hope that I can say that without being remonstrated with by the usual channels for saying too much.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para2"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, and the noble Lord, Lord Renton, will be helped by knowing that the Act that we are amending is the 2001 Act. This is available on the website, and it will be available in an amended form, so when one comes to read it, one will read it as one Act, as opposed to the different <P>


<a name="column_705"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 705</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments. I know that that is important for many practitioners. I will also take away the concerns about having shorter versions of data that will tell people exactly how things work. I commend to your Lordships the "Just Ask!" website, which is a Department for Constitutional Affairs website on law. Your Lordships will know that we make every effort to ensure that clear information is provided for those who need to have it.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para3"></a>I will take away the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, and give further consideration to the comments made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson. It is refreshing to stand at the Dispatch Box and for once to be castigated for being too timorous, as opposed to too bold.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-08_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   There is nothing new in this habit of amending clauses back. I originally thought that it was solely a job creation scheme for my learned friends. Would it be possible, in a case of a Bill like this, to put in notes, or something like that, what the whole clause will be as amended if it is required to be amended? Then you do not have to read. It does not have to be part of the Bill. There would be a piece of paper that says, "This is how Bill X would read when amended".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Before the noble Baroness finishes, I was delighted to hear that the Government website will now have the 2001 Act in its amended form. Until recently, it was an enormous problem that the government website contained Acts only in their original form. I had not heard that this practice had changed. I hope that it has changed generally, and not just in relation to this Act. If so, it is an enormous step forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I am so delighted that the noble Lord has something to commend this Government on. I thank him wholeheartedly for those congratulations.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "DETENTION OF CHILDREN: ASSESSMENT
<br>
(1) Section 62 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (c. 41) (detention by the Secretary of State) shall be amended as follows.

(2) After subsection (9) insert&#151;
<br>
"(9A) Where a detained person, within the meaning of section 147 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, as amended by this section, is under the age of 18, an independent assessor appointed by the Department for Education and Skills, or the appropriate executive body in the country, must visit the detained person for as long as the person remains detained to carry out on each visit an assessment into the welfare, developmental and educational needs of the detained person.
<br>
(9B) All assessments under this section shall be guided by the principles set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Children Act 1989, the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 or the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-08_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: As we pointed out in debates on the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill in 2002, the White Paper said that detention of children was to be confined to wholly exceptional circumstances, and then to the shortest possible time. The operation enforcement manual still provided up to October 2001 that families with children were to be detained only for a few days prior to removal. From then on, there were no separate criteria for the detention of families with children, and the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, was unable to give any estimate of the number of children likely to be detained, let alone for how long.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para7"></a>On 31 October, at Third Reading, I mentioned the case of Jacqueline Konan, who had been detained with her small daughter Thelma already for several months by that time. She had miscarried the day that she was taken into custody, for which she received no medical attention at Harmondsworth. After that debate, I wrote 13 letters to the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, to Beverley Hughes, to MODCU, the section of the IND that was dealing with the case, and to the adjudicators who heard applications for bail. The case was dealt with in a broadcast on "Woman's Hour". In spite of those many appeals, it was not until 23 December that Ms Konan and her daughter were finally given bail. At that time, the Home Office was still opposing it. This mother and her child had spent 190 days in detention to no purpose and at great expense to the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para8"></a>I wrote to the then Minister saying that Ms Konan's case illustrated that prolonged and unnecessary periods of detention were occurring. I asked her to give me details of the length of time spent in detention by the 36 children mentioned in a Written Answer from the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, and I suggested that the Home Office make statistics available about the detention of children on a regular basis. It was impossible, I suggested, for Parliament to monitor the Government's policy of detaining as few children as possible, for as short a time as possible, without having the statistics, and, because there was no independent review of individual cases, things could and did go wrong.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para9"></a>On 7 October, Ms Konan finally got a new hearing before an adjudicator, represented this time by excellent counsel and instructed by the best solicitors, and on 27 October the appeal was determined in her favour. That, by the way, could not happen under the <P>


<a name="column_707"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 707</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>new legal aid regime, because the time allowed had been exhausted by the previous, incompetent solicitors. Ms Konan then went on to take proceedings against the Secretary of State for wrongful detention, and on 21 January 2004 she was awarded substantial damages in the High Court by Mr Justice Collins. In delivering his judgment Mr Justice Collins said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This is a story of very poor administrative decisions . . . It is a cautionary tale since it shows that decisions of the defendant's officials and the appellant authorities can be wrong and that there is a need for judicial assessment"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-08_para10"></a>
a point that we shall return to when we get to Clause 14. He continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the possibility of judicial review had not existed, the claimants would wrongly have been returned to the Ivory Coast".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-08_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40427-08_para12"></a>I wrote to the then Minister the following day, saying that my efforts to get Jacqueline released were obviously inadequate, but I did not know what more I could have done. What worried me was that the Minister was totally impervious to my appeals and that the important duty that we have as Members to make representations to Ministers to correct injustice could only work if Ministers gave careful and dispassionate consideration to what we had to say. In this case, the longstop of representations simply did not work. Apart from the criticism made by the judge of officials and adjudicators, the Minister too had failed in her duty to protect the weak and vulnerable from the unlawful exercise of the power to detain.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para13"></a>I wondered how many other Jacquelines there had been who did not have the support of Members of Parliament or of good solicitors. I had not received an answer to that letter by the time Ms Hughes left office, and I now repeat the questions to the noble Baroness who will answer this debate.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para14"></a>The Chief Inspector of Prisons, in her report on Dungavel Removal Centre, dated October 2002 but not published until August the following year, said that there should be an independent assessment of the welfare, developmental and educational needs of each detained child, guided by the principles set out in international and UK domestic law in relation to children. She said that this should be done as soon as possible after detention, and then repeated at regular intervals, to advise on the compatibility of detention with the welfare of the child, and to inform decisions on detention and continued detention. That is what we seek in this amendment. What the Home Office said, 14 months after the chief inspector's recommendations were originally made, was that it would ensure that the welfare and educational needs of any child detained in Dungavel for 21 days were assessed satisfactorily so that the Home Office could be assured that those needs were being met.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para15"></a>That is a wholly inadequate response. The assessment needed is not just for children in Dungavel but for children wherever they happen to land up in the detention estate. Oakington is now being used not only for fast-track cases but for the overspill from other detention centres, including families who have been allocated there by MODCU or DEPMU since the end of May 2003. These families are not dealt with by the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Oakington immigration staff and they are not representable by the IAS or the RLC in spite of the fact that they are next door to them on the premises.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para16"></a>We know of two recent cases where single mothers and their children were detained for 143 and 114 days respectively at Oakington. Ms W, who had a seven-month-old baby, was released on temporary admission at the end of November 2003. Ms D, with a nine-year-old son, got bail on 15 December and the Home Office withdrew its "clearly unfounded claim" label. But those women are continuing to report six months later, their cases not having been resolved. Clearly neither of them was imminently removable and they did not meet the criteria for detention.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para17"></a>I was a member of Sub-Committee F which recently visited Oakington. We saw that there were reasonable play facilities for smaller children, but there was no education whatever and no facilities for children over 12. The Home Office is obviously reluctant to invest in those facilities at Oakington when the site is due to close in 2006. Incidentally, there seem to be no definite plans for its replacement. The Detention Services Policy Unit said, in a note circulated on 1 April, to the attendees at the detention user group meeting, that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"planning is under way for the future location of the NSA process".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-08_para18"></a>
It is a matter of serious concern to us that so little time remains for obtaining planning permission&#151;including the possibility of an inquiry&#151;letting the contract and finishing the construction of the new site within two years. What happens to the contract to operate Oakington when it closes? Does the existing contractor automatically assume responsibility for NSA detainees in their new location, or is that contract a new one?
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para19"></a>The situation is complicated by the fact that Group 4 is selling the subsidiary which operates both Oakington and Yarlswood, together with two other establishments where immigration Act detainees are held. We understand that the Yarlswood site has been ruled out as a possible home for the NSA process for reasons that I find difficult to understand. Expansion of Yarlswood to its full operational capacity of 400, including families with children, is to be complete by January 2005. How many places will there be after that for children, and what does that say about the policy of keeping the numbers of children detained to the minimum possible?
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para20"></a>At Dungavel, HM Inspectorate of Education found improved facilities on its visit of 2003, following that of the chief inspector, but it said that these facilities were acceptable only for periods of less than two weeks. It confirmed the view expressed in other reports that the detention of children should be an exceptional measure and should not, in any event, exceed a matter of days.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para21"></a>The Home Office did give a snapshot picture of children in detention at the end of 2003 in the quarterly RDS figures, showing that it would have been possible to do that all along. At that date, there were 10 detained children, of whom two-thirds, or 6.67, had been in custody for less than 14 days. The remaining <P>


<a name="column_709"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 709</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>3.33 children had been held for less than three months. Come on now, cannot the Home Office give the figures instead of percentages? Would the noble Baroness not think it possible for the IND to state the actual number of children? It is probably useful for those responsible for detention to know that their work will be subject to this limited and unnecessarily confusing degree of public scrutiny on a quarterly basis, but it falls a long way short of the undertakings that were given by the Minister in response to the Home Affairs Select Committee's report on asylum.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para22"></a>The Minister, Beverley Hughes, said in a press statement of 16 December last, that a Home Office Minister would have to authorise the detention of any child for more than 28 days. Is that happening, and will the Minister say how many times the Home Secretary has used the lock, and whether he has ever used the key instead? What progress has the Home Office made with the commitment to ensure that the educational and welfare needs of any child detained in Dungavel for 21 days are assessed, and to ensure&#151;in consultation with the Scottish Executive&#151;that educational provision is made for all children detained for more than just a short period?
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para23"></a>It is two years since the Government altered their policy to allow families to be detained for longer periods. They have failed to implement the recommendations of the chief inspector, and they have ignored the repeated pleas of children's organisations, refugee bodies and Members of both Houses. They have rejected the UNHCR guidelines, which say that children should not be detained at all, and they have turned a deaf ear to repeated demands by Parliament for better oversight of children who are detained. The amendment would not solve all those problems, but it would ensure, at least, that the welfare, educational and developmental needs of all children, not just those in Dungavel, were examined by an independent assessor. I beg to move.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I agree fully with the UNHCR's guidelines on refugee children, which state that such children should not be detained. It is, no doubt, possible to argue&#151;it is argued&#151;that there are sometimes exceptional circumstances existing for very short periods when such children have to be detained. One can accept that, but I was happy to add my name to the amendment because it would provide minimum safeguards, by increasing the scrutiny of the welfare of detained children.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para24"></a>The amendment is, as has been said, fully in line with the recommendations of HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, who inquired into Dungavel detention centre in Scotland and four other immigration detention centres. Her report was made available in April last year, so a full year has gone by since, with, as far as I know, little or no action.
<P>

<a name="40427-08_para25"></a>We should also take note that the Bill is being considered in parallel with the Children Bill. Clause 7 of the Children Bill extends the duty to safeguard children and promote their welfare to police and <P>


<a name="column_710"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 710</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prisons. Significantly, however, it omits extending the duty to immigration removal or detention centres. The amendment gives us a chance to do something to remedy that omission, and, for that reason, I am pleased to support it.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-09_spnew0"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Chester: </B>   We wholeheartedly concur with the careful analysis offered by the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Hylton. In all such matters, we must put the interests of the child at the centre.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para0"></a>Various voluntary societies that care for children have come together in the Refugee Children's Consortium, among them the Church of England Children's Society, Barnardo's and a number of other organisations. Their collective wisdom is that there must be very exceptional reasons to justify the detention of a child. It is unclear that those reasons usually exist. It is nothing short of a scandal that it happened in the Konan case, which the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, spoke about.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para1"></a>If it is the case that, because of the dynamics of a particular family, it is in the best interests of a child to detain that child, it is doubly important that the interests of the child are put first. As the amendment says, that would require an independent assessment of the child's needs&#151;not simply an assessment in the department, a political entity, but an independent assessment. There are creative ways of addressing that. One thinks of the work that the education services do with Traveller children. We are light years ahead of where we used to be with children who come into schools for a short period. One can think of all sorts of things that can be done. In the exceptional conditions in which a child is detained, we must bend over backwards to do the best for that child, so that detention does not become something of a nightmare, as, I imagine, it normally would.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para2"></a>I hope that the Government can assure us that, in their plans and policies, the interests of the child will always come first. They should confirm that consideration of those interests will not normally&#151;only very exceptionally&#151;require the detention of the child. If we are to detain a child, we must bend over backwards to do what is in the best interests of the child, while we, as a society, are responsible for him or her. That is not recent wisdom; it goes back to the Old Testament. Concern for the stranger in the midst was at the heart of the ethic of a society that sought to care. Among those strangers in the midst, the children of asylum seekers must come pretty near the top of the list.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   The noble Lords who put their names to the amendment were right to table it and give us the opportunity to press the Government on the need to assess the requirements of children in detention. I thank the Refugee Children's Consortium for its helpful briefing. I agree with the consortium that detention gives rise to a range of child protection issues and that detention can damage the physical and emotional health of children. The consortium is right to draw attention to the fact that the Bill does not <P>


<a name="column_711"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 711</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>address the concerns about children being held at immigration removal centres that were highlighted most recently in the report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons. That report was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para3"></a>Like other noble Lords, I noted the Home Office announcement on the assessment of children's welfare and educational needs after 21 days. That will apply only to Dungavel and will not extend to other detention centres. Have the Government reconsidered that position? Have they considered extending the assessments beyond Dungavel?
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para4"></a>The briefing from the Refugee Children's Consortium confirms the observation made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that children over the age of 12 at Oakington receive no education and that children under 12 may use the play room, where there is structured play but no formal education. It can be argued&#151;it is, on occasion&#151;that children should not be in detention for long and that, therefore, those problems should not arise. In a perfect world, children would be in detention for as brief a moment as possible. However, we are told by the Refugee Children's Consortium&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, reminded us about it&#151;that, in two recent cases, single mothers and their children were detained at Oakington for 143 days and 114 respectively. Can the Government assure us that they intend to implement the recommendation of HMIP for an independent assessment of the welfare, educational and developmental needs of each detained child? Will the Government give an assurance that implementation will apply to all centres, not just Dungavel? When will the implementation be carried out?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Noble Lords have probably guessed that we are talking about Dungavel because there was an almighty row in Scotland about the children there. Noble Lords may have seen some details of it in the press, I was one of those who, to an extent, defended the Government's position. The row was about not sending children to local schools. I deployed the argument locally that it was probably better for children who were in detention only for a short time that their education should take place in the centre and that they should not be shipped off to a school at which they would make friends before having to go away and leave them behind, making them even more disorientated than they would have been in any case. That was why the Government acted on Dungavel.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para5"></a>It is important that we pay attention to the matter and that assessments are made in the most practical way possible. It is not only a question of assessments; the children should have the right facilities. They must have them, and it is wrong not to provide them.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para6"></a>The right reverend Prelate talked a little as if children were being treated on their own. The children are in the centres because they should not, if possible, be separated from their parents, whom it has been necessary to detain. Apart from trying to move the <P>


<a name="column_712"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 712</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parents on as quickly as possible, we must make facilities available. I hope that in her brief the noble Baroness has some detail about what has been provided at Dungavel. I hope that I did not defend her position on false premises.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-09_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I support the amendment. This issue has been debated on a number of occasions. Very many Members of the Committee are against the whole practice of having children in detention in whatever circumstances. I also think that children and families are among the least likely people to abscond if they are under conditions of reporting fairly frequently to a local police station or wherever. Whatever one's view of that, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the paramount importance of doing what is in the best interests of the children must take precedence over any other considerations, except in really dire circumstances where severe danger is envisaged.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Perhaps I may say straight away that I understand the import of the concern and sentiment behind this new clause. However, while I share the concern that we should have due regard to the welfare of children detained with their families&#151;in practice, we do&#151;I cannot accept on behalf of the Government that this need is best met by what would appear to be a bureaucratic system of assessment and reviews. Not only does it seem unwieldy, but we also question whether it is necessary or workable. I take entirely into account that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has referred to a couple of cases where the time spent in detention has been considerable.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para7"></a>The present position is that the welfare of the children concerned is monitored constantly by the excellent healthcare and other staff in removal centres. Where there are concerns, those are addressed either locally or by the Immigration Service. That includes consideration of whether detention should continue in appropriate cases. Perhaps I may respectfully say that the suggested system of assessment would not help that process. In all probability, it would add an additional layer of bureaucracy.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para8"></a>I assure Members of the Committee that, from our figures, very few families with children are detained. The vast majority of those who are detained are held for only a very short period, most often just before removal. As the published asylum statistics show, there were just 10 individuals under 18 years old detained at 27 December 2003. Two-thirds of those had been detained for 14 days or less.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I did point out the absurdity of talking about two-thirds of 10 children. Could the noble Baroness not say whether the figure is six or seven?

<A NAME="40427-09_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I cannot. The figures given to me refer to two-thirds. Members of the Committee will know that the figures are aggregated <P>


<a name="column_713"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 713</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and set out in that way. As always, I shall give as much information as I have available to me. If I can obtain that figure, I shall write to the noble Lord. What is important is that the figure of those detained is low. Against that background, it is difficult to see what practical purpose would be served by an independent assessor in those cases. More than likely, the children would have been removed or released from detention before the assessor had a chance to do much if anything at all.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para9"></a>Of course, I note that the proposed assessment system shares some of the features as one of the recommendations made last year by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons in relation to children detained with their families in removal centres. My right honourable friend, the former Minister of State for Citizenship, Immigration and Counter-Terrorism rejected that recommendation for much the same reasons that I am unable to accept the new clause. But she made it absolutely clear that she would look further at the issue. That remains our position.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para10"></a>Perhaps I may reassure noble Lords that we are not complacent about the issue. We recognise that detention, even if only for a short period, is not an ideal situation for children. No one would argue otherwise. However, we must recognise reality. While the vast majority of asylum-seeking families are not detained and live in the community, there are some cases where detention is necessary in order to maintain an effective immigration control and, in particular, to enforce the removal of those who will not leave voluntarily. That is the reality of the situation in which we find ourselves.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para11"></a>Nevertheless, within that context, we are keen to ensure that children's welfare is taken into account. We have indicated that we have been exploring the scope for enhancing welfare and educational assessment for children who, exceptionally, have been detained for longer periods than the norm. That remains the case. Much good work has been done already. We continue to work with local agencies in that area. For example, we are discussing arrangements with South Lanarkshire Council to conduct a welfare assessment for any child detained at Dungavel for 21 days. The outcome of such a review would inform any ministerial authorisation for detention to continue beyond 28 days.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para12"></a>We are just as interested as anyone in the welfare of children detained with their families. We are just as determined that any problems or concerns are identified and dealt with speedily and appropriately. That is what happens in removal centres now. We approach the issue from the position of established and developing systems, which must be sensible and workable. We must not only have the interests of the child in mind, but also take proper account of the balance that has to be struck between the need to maintain effective immigration control and the need to remove those families who have no lawful basis to stay here. The system proposed in the new clause does not fit that bill.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para13"></a>As regards the case of Ms Konan, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, of course, we accept the court's view that the detention in this case was <P>


<a name="column_714"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 714</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unlawful. We regret that it occurred. I say that without any hesitation. The detention procedures have been tightened up since the time of that case. The systems are in place to prevent a recurrence. That is why we have a closer and more frequent review of family-detained cases and ministerial authorisation of detention beyond 28 days. My right honourable colleague Des Browne, who is now the Minister dealing with those cases, will be asked to review the cases which go beyond 28 days.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para14"></a>Of course, I hear the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and others about family facilities at Oakington, plans to replace Oakington and ministerial authorisation for detention. At Oakington, arrangements for educational provision are being put in place. As the noble Lord said, play facilities for older children are being looked into. As yet, no final decision has been taken about what will happen to replace Oakington. But those are the issues that continue to be developed.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para15"></a>I hope that I have already satisfactorily dealt with the system for authorisation as regards those who stay in residence for more than 28 days. Since mid-January, all of those children have been subject to authorisation. I cannot provide precise figures about authorisation, but I will be happy to write to noble Lords. At Dungavel, as at 26 April, we have six families and 10 children, with four of school age. At Oakington, currently, we have 11 families and 14 children, with six of school age. That is a total of 17 families and 24 children, with 10 of school age.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para16"></a>As regards detention of families, between 27 February and 25 March 2004, 95 families were taken into detention. Of 99 other families, 69 families were removed and 30 were released. There have been 134 children removed or released. The average time that those 134 children spent in detention was 9.8 days. Members of the Committee will see that we have done a great deal of work to try to ensure that the children who are taken into detention are those who absolutely need to be taken in with their families. If they are taken in, they are taken in for the very shortest period of time possible.
<P>

<a name="40427-09_para17"></a>We will continue to endeavour to do all that we can to make that a proper process. I hope that noble Lords will now agree with me that, bearing in mind those changes, the complicated assessment process that the amendment suggests would not fit well.

<A NAME="40427-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I am most grateful to all Members of the Committee who have taken part in the debate. Every speaker expressed great concern about the detention of children as a general matter and about the cases we are discussing in particular. The general sense of the Committee is that we have not done enough to minimise the number of children taken into detention or to see that their interests are properly safeguarded. I was worried by the figures that the noble Baroness gave, because they show that that number of children being detained has risen from 10 at the end of December 2003 to 24, so we appear to be detaining more children now.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para0"></a>I asked the Minister what would be the ultimate size of the detention estate for families with children once Yarl's Wood had been extended. She was not able to give me that figure but perhaps she will write to me about it as well as the other matters left hanging in the air. She said that systems are in place to prevent recurrence of cases of the type that we cited, not just that of Jacqueline Konan, but of the two single mothers who were kept in Oakington for 114 and 143 days, as she knows.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para1"></a>There were systems in place at that time. There was something called Parliament and parliamentarians were writing to Ministers. Ministers cannot say that they were not seized of the fact that those women were detained for wholly excessive periods. As I told the noble Baroness, I wrote 13 times to Ministers about the case of Jacqueline Konan. I telephoned the Minster's office endlessly, but they paid no attention. So what systems can we have that would be more effective than Members of Parliament badgering Ministers' offices? The one factor that was missing in those three cases was that we did not have regular reporting from the Home Office of how many children were in detention and for how long they had been there.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para2"></a>One factor in the debate about which I am pleased is that the noble Baroness has seen fit to disclose the current figures, which I hope will not be a one-off. If we get a snapshot and we do not know what is happening in a week or 10 days' time, the position might be entirely different. So I hope that we can guarantee the regular reporting of the number of children in detention and for how long they have been there. In order to ensure that we obtain not only a system of assessment but also a system of reporting we shall need to return to the matter on Report.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para3"></a>While I accept entirely that we may not have the wording exactly right, an independent assessment of the children's needs is essential because the Home Office has manifestly failed to provide children with the necessary facilities that they require to ensure that their educational development and welfare needs are met. As the noble Baroness has just acknowledged, that has been the case in Oakington, where there is no education. There are only play facilities for small children under 12. Although she said that that will be provided at a future date, unless we have an independent monitoring system to ensure that it happens I am certain from our previous experience that we could not guarantee it.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para4"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for what she said, but we still find it unsatisfactory and we look forward to returning to the matter on Report. In the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40427-10_para8"></a>[Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 31A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 44, line 1, leave out from beginning to "as" in line 2 and insert "This Part shall not apply to a state unless the Secretary of State certifies that, in general, the assumptions in sub-paragraph (1A)(a) are true.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-10_para9"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
(1A) The assumptions are that, in so far as relevant to the question mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), the State may be treated"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-10_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 18 and Schedule 3 deal with situations where a person can be removed to a third country that is deemed safe without substantive consideration for that person's asylum claim. They replace and extend the provisions currently in Sections 11 and 12 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. I have tabled the amendment to ask the Government to place on the record their response to paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 12th report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. I am aware that although the report has been published there has been no publication of the Government's response. I hope that the Minister is now able to share it with the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para11"></a>Paragraphs 11 and 12 make it clear that the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"consequences of a state being specified in a particular Part of Schedule 3 are that certain assumptions are made by the bill about the safety of that state".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-10_para12"></a>
As the report points out,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there is no express requirement on the Secretary of State to be satisfied that those assumptions in fact apply before making an order which specifies the state".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-10_para13"></a>
The committee observes that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"section 94(5) of the 2002 Act which is amended by clause 15 of the bill and is mentioned in paragraph 15 of the Home Office's memorandum) allows a state, or part of a state, to be added to the list under section 94 only if the Secretary of State is satisfied as to certain matters (such as that there is, in general, no serious risk of persecution)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-10_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40427-10_para15"></a>In respect of that matter, the committee drew the House's attention to the absence of similar provision in the Bill. It makes the point that the House "will wish"&#151;not even "may wish"&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to consider whether a similar express restriction should be placed on the powers to list any state in one of the three lists in Schedule 3 (for example, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that, in general, the assumptions which will be made by the listing are true)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-10_para16"></a><P>

<a name="40427-10_para17"></a>In response to that report from our respected committee of the House I thought it right to table Amendment No. 31A. I am grateful to the Public Bill Office for its assistance. The drafting of my amendment may be pulled apart. I hasten to add that the drafting is not of moment here; I wish to see what the Government's response is.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para18"></a>I tabled the amendment relatively late, last Thursday. Normally, as the Committee will be aware, I like to try to table amendments early to give all Members a full chance to consider them. The reason for the delay was simply that I wanted to see whether the Government would seek the opportunity to <P>


<a name="column_717"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 717</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enlighten the Committee in respect of the amendment and others I tabled late. When I was aware that they were not going to do so, taking account of the strictures of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, I jumped in and tabled the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I understand that this is a probing amendment. I make no comment about the noble Baroness's drafting; I compliment her as always on her energy in getting down anything of a fit and proper nature&#151;which this certainly is&#151;that allows me to answer the question that she raised. The amendment's effect is to add the requirement that the Secretary of State expressly certifies that the safety test in terms of the Refugee Convention has been made out when deciding whether to list a country at part 3 of Schedule 3.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para19"></a>Schedule 3 takes a differentiated approach to challenges against removal to safe third countries, an approach based in part on Section 94 of the 2002 Act. It is worth noting that part 6 of Schedule 3 ensures active parliamentary scrutiny of the decision to add a country to any of the lists. Parliament will therefore have an opportunity to debate the appropriateness of including a particular country on a list.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para20"></a>Although the schedule reflects the approach taken towards human rights challenges in the non-suspensive appeals&#151;the NSA provisions set out in Section 94 of the 2002 Act&#151;there is an important difference between the two sets of provisions. Put simply, the fact is that in this schedule we are dealing with returns to safe third countries and not countries of origin, so the provision is not and does not need to be absolutely on all fours with the approach taken in the 2002 Act. Furthermore, we consider that a general safety test is implicit and consequently we do not feel that the insertion of such a test in the manner described is absolutely necessary.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para21"></a>We have not as yet submitted our report to the Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform because of the points raised by this amendment. As noble Lords will know, the directive is still being negotiated at the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which is to meet on Thursday. Of course it is our intention to try to reach agreement in relation to the amendment in accordance with that which is consistent with our domestic policy objectives.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para22"></a>I hope that, with my response, the noble Baroness will feel that she has had sufficient clarification about matters which I know have been of concern to her, as well as on those which she raised with my honourable friend Caroline Flint.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. This clarification suggests that, "We are not giving the answer yet because . . . " rather than giving the answer itself. However, I understand the position in which the Government find themselves. Indeed, a later amendment specifically asks the Government to put on the record assurances with regard to the <P>


<a name="column_718"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 718</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>negotiations on the directive. Last week as a matter of courtesy I contacted the Bill team to explain the purpose of my amendments, otherwise it would not have been immediately obvious.
<P>

<a name="40427-10_para23"></a>I am also grateful to the noble Baroness for making the distinction between the definition of types of countries; that is, the difference between countries of origin and third countries and therefore the Government's position that there can be a different assessment of whether they are safe and how much information must be included in the Bill. The noble Baroness also pointed out that Part 6 of the schedule provides for active parliamentary scrutiny on whether a country should be included on a list. I leave further comment on that to later amendments because, of course, the noble Baroness will be aware of the concerns that not all orders are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, but are subject to negative resolution. However, I shall return to that matter at the appropriate point. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B>   moved Amendment No. 36A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 46, line 29, after "add" insert "or remove"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-11_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40427-11_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 18 and Schedule 3 create a new and fiendishly complicated structure of "safe country" provisions which allow a person to be removed without substantive consideration of his asylum application. The proposals now before the Committee represent what I consider to be a large extension of the powers contained in Sections 11 and 12 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and Section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. There are now four sets of circumstances in which a person may be removed without a right of appeal, arranged according to the degree of confidence in their safety.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para2"></a>The first category is removal to states where a person is deemed to be safe vis-a-vis both the Refugee Convention and the ECHR. These are the existing and accession states of the European Union plus Norway and Iceland, which are all members of the Dublin Convention under which an asylum seeker can be sent back to the country that he arrived in first.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para3"></a>The second category comprises unnamed states which are deemed to be Refugee Convention safe, but not necessarily safe from refoulement to a country where a person may not be safe. For these countries, the Secretary of State will certify cases unless there is reason to think that they are not clearly unfounded.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para4"></a>The third category comprises another empty list, also Refugee Convention safe, but where claims based on the ECHR may be certified as clearly unfounded.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para5"></a>Finally, there is individual certification, which may be applied to a person who is not a national of the country to which he is being sent, if he is not at risk of being refouled and is not at risk of being persecuted there for any Refugee Convention reason.
<P>


<a name="column_719"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 719</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para6"></a>The difference between these provisions and the safe country provisions set out in the 1999 and 2002 Acts is that under previous legislation each case had to be individually certified. The certificate could then be challenged under Section 65 of the 1999 Act and Section 82(1) of the 2002 Act, although in the latter case the right had to be exercised from overseas.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para7"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, said in the case of Yogathas and Thangarasa:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The possibility of a challenge on human rights grounds is preserved by Section 65 of the 1999 Act as was no doubt necessary if that Act was to be compatible with the obligations of the UK under the Human Rights Act . . . ".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-11_para8"></a>
In that case it was not suggested that the state to which the person was being sent would itself violate the ECHR, but that he could be sent on to a country where his rights were likely to be violated.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para9"></a>To be fair, the Government are not saying that all the countries in these lists are going to maintain an impeccable human rights performance for all time. In answer to my honourable friend Mark Oaten in Standing Committee on 22 January, the then Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If we had evidence that a country was not operating to the letter of the human rights convention, I think that that would mean that we would consider the provisions of Part 2 of Schedule 3 and the inclusion of that country on the list".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee B, 22/1/04; col. 355.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-11_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40427-11_para11"></a>If the lapse had occurred in only one or two cases, the removal of the country from the list might be an extreme remedy, but the Secretary of State has no power to downgrade a state from list 1 to list 2 or 3, where affirmative resolution certification would be necessary. Unfortunately, while the option of taking the country off the list altogether was set out in the original Bill, it was taken out in Committee for reasons that were not made clear. Perhaps the Minister can give an explanation for that when she comes to reply. Our amendment seeks to restore the power and I hope that the Government will accept the idea in principle, although I acknowledge that the wording needs to be tidied up.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para12"></a>Only 15 years ago the A8 countries were all communist dictatorships, and three of the western European EU states were fascist dictatorships during the post-war era. In the future, other countries will join the EU and will automatically be added to the first list, even though their human rights past may have been appalling. This clause gives no flexibility in the treatment of states in an enlarged Europe which do not continue to maintain the standards we have set, which I am sure is a mistake. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   It may be appropriate for me to speak to the amendment grouped with this one tabled in my name, Amendment No. 36AA. As an aside, I remind the Committee that earlier we were teasing the noble Baroness about whether she could give us any news on what was happening in the usual channels. I have just been handed a draft of amendments to Clause 14, so I suspect that there will now be a flurry of activity on the part of noble Lords.
<P>


<a name="column_720"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 720</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para13"></a>The Minister seems to think that she does not have a copy of the amendments. However, they are tabled in her name. I am glad to know that she has an alter ego who has been active. At first glance, it appears that these amendments cover the substantive matters that we had hoped to deal with today but which were delayed to allow the Government time for further consideration.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para14"></a>I turn to the matter in hand, Amendment No. 36AA. The effect of the amendment would be to make all orders affirmative, both those that remove countries from the safe list as well as those that add them, As I mentioned, I have given the Government notice of the reason behind my tabling of these amendments.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para15"></a>What will be the impact on the United Kingdom Government's ability to amend safe country lists of the proposed directive on minimum standards of procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status? Last week, EU Sub-committee E on Law and Institutions put questions on this directive to the Minister, Caroline Flint, in advance of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, to which the Minister referred, which sits on 29&#150;30 April. If the directive is adopted, would Her Majesty's Government be able to designate any country they choose as safe without any reference to the terms of the directive? Would Her Majesty's Government be able to remove any country from the safe list without any reference to the directive? In other words, will Her Majesty's Government have complete freedom of action in those designations?
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para16"></a>The reason I ask these questions is that when Caroline Flint was giving answers she was directed to two articles in the directive, which is under negotiation at present. Article 30A states that the Council may, acting upon a proposal from the Commission, adopt a minimum common list of third countries that shall be regarded as safe countries of origin by member states. It also provides that the Council may amend that list by adding or removing names of states.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para17"></a>The difficulty arises when one looks at Article 30B, which starts off by making it look as though the member states can go their own way in listing safe countries if they wish. That would be all right. But paragraph 2 goes on to restrict that freedom of action to states that do not appear on the minimum common list as safe countries of origin for the purpose of examining applications for asylum. So, if one puts Articles 30A and 30B together, does that mean that we are bound in this country to adopt the minimum common list, whatever it says?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-11_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I shall deal first with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, Amendment No. 36A, before turning to Amendment No. 36AA.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para18"></a>I should like to begin by drawing the Committee's attention to the provisions in Part 6 of the schedule which provide the order-making powers to add a state to the lists at Parts 2, 3 and 4 by an order subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. These provisions ensure that the inclusion of a country on any list will be <P>


<a name="column_721"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 721</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subject to active parliamentary scrutiny. Part 6 of the schedule provides for the removal of a state from the lists at Parts 3 and 4 by order subject to annulment by resolution of either House of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para19"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 36A, we do not consider it necessary to provide a similar order-making power in relation to the removal of a state from the list at Part 2. I should reiterate that we intend that the list at Part 2 should be limited to European Union member states which are party to the Dublin arrangements for determining the state responsible for examining an asylum application, and other states, such as Norway and Iceland, which are associated with those arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40427-11_para20"></a>I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, says about new states which may join the Union, but he will remember that all new states seeking to join will still have to comply with the acquis in order to be accepted. In the very unlikely event that such a state deteriorated to a point where it no longer generally met the tests set out in Part 2, we would consider bringing forward new primary legislation to recognise that. This would also apply should any agreements between the Community and other states associating them with the Dublin arrangements be terminated or renounced.

<A NAME="40427-11_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   In 1967, Greece was a functioning, squabbling, shrieking democracy when along came a bunch of colonels who kicked out the democrats. I am not saying that that will happen in any of the new Balkan states or Turkey if, peradventure, it should join, but there will always be that risk. Should we not have a quicker method than primary legislation to deal with the problem that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has shown could theoretically exist?

<P>
<A NAME="40427-12_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I of course recognise the noble Earl's anxiety about that. However, he should bear in mind that the deterioration of a member state would be a considerable issue for all other member states. It would be a very serious issue and, in order to act in this way against a fellow member state, primary legislation would be necessary.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para0"></a>Of course, if there were an emergency, it is possible for the parliamentary procedure to be accelerated to meet it. But we hope that that will not be necessary. We are keeping such legislation in reserve for a situation which may very well either never occur or occur in extremis.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para1"></a>As to the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, in her amendment, member states will have the ability to designate safe countries of origin and will have to consider those countries which are in the EU list as safe. However, as countries of origin, there will always be case by case consideration of asylum applications. The provisions of Articles 30A and 30B of the directive do not deal with third countries.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para2"></a>I reiterate what I said earlier: the directive has not yet been finalised. We wish to ensure that it is compatible with our policy objectives and we will negotiate to that end.

<a name="40427-12_para3"></a>Amendment No. 36A seeks to extend the affirmative resolution procedure to the removal of states from the lists at Parts 3 and 4&#151;countries not subject to the Dublin arrangements. We do not agree that any decision that the Government might take to remove a state from these lists should require the approval of both Houses of Parliament in the same manner as we consider appropriate for the addition of a country, which is a matter of greater importance. The approach that we have taken with regard to the amendment of the lists of countries not subject to the Dublin arrangements is consistent with that taken generally within legislation, such as the non-suspensive appeals provisions in the 2002 Act.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para4"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord are content with that explanation and will not pursue their amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation that she has given and for drawing our attention to the provisions in Part 6 of the schedule. I had appreciated that the power to remove countries from the lists at Parts 2 and 3 existed and that that power did not extend to the Part 1 list. The whole point of the amendment was that we should treat these countries in a uniform manner.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para5"></a>Although I accept the Minister's argument that we are looking at a very remote contingency in a European Union country, we should consider other countries which are not members at present. We are not legislating only for the next year or two; we hope, presumably, that once the Bill becomes an Act it will still be on the statute book when the next wave of accessions occurs.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para6"></a>We are looking at a very large community of 27 or 28 nations and the Minister is saying that the eventuality that one of them will become undemocratic is so remote that we do not need to take account of that in the Bill. On the other hand, she is saying that the countries on the second list, which are equally democratic&#151;otherwise we would not apply the procedure to them&#151;are obviously going to be more likely to drop out of being democratic and to become dictatorships. If that were not the case, there would be no point in differentiating between the two lists or in saying that we will have an order-making power to cross off those that are not members of the European Union, but, having joined the European Union, those states are so extremely unlikely to revert back to dictatorship or repression that we do not need an equivalent power.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para7"></a>I personally cannot see the logic in that, but we have obviously not succeeded in persuading the Minister that there should be a uniform approach. We shall have to take the matter away and consider, before we come to another stage, whether we want to pursue it further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40427-12_para12"></a>Clause 20 [Deportation or removal: cooperation]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McNally </B>   moved Amendment No. 36B:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 19, line 14, at beginning insert "Subject to subsection (1A),"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-12_para13"></a><P>

<a name="40427-12_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: Noble Lords will see from the groupings list that the amendments relating to Clause 20 are split into three separate groups. At a late hour last night, when replying, the Minister reminded us that she had an Exocet in her weaponry, in that she always had a 15 or 20-minute reply ready for every group of amendments. Therefore, faced with that challenge, I had a hard look at the next group of amendments. I believe that it would help the Committee to have a more coherent debate and keep at least two of those Exocets in their boxes, if I spoke now to all five amendments covering the clause&#151;Amendments Nos. 36B to 36F. I sent billets doux to the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and both said that they thought it would be an appropriate course of action.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para15"></a>The Explanatory Notes state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Clause 20 creates a new offence of failing to comply, without reasonable excuse, with steps that the Secretary of State may require someone to take so as to enable their deportation or removal from the United Kingdom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-12_para16"></a><P>

<a name="40427-12_para17"></a>As a number of commentators have said, that represents a considerable extension of powers on behalf of the Government. Concern has been expressed that the clause is drafted in dangerously wide, generalised and all-embracing terms. Failure to comply may lead to prosecution and up to 12 months' imprisonment. Such a serious offence should not be framed so widely as to give immigration officers such enormous discretion to bring prosecutions without clearer interpretation or safeguards in the Bill or in published guidelines.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para18"></a>We believe that much clearer definitions of the specific actions requiring the co-operation of persons are needed. They should include special details of the type of information required; the process and forms referred to; the protection required in relation to personal data processing and recording; the nature and scope of interviews; the circumstances when contacts with other governments and states may reasonably be required; and guidance to immigration officers in the conduct of interviews and decisions to refer for prosecution.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para19"></a>There is particular concern whether data protection in those circumstances is fully compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights. There has also been special concern expressed to us about how the clause will affect children. The decision to start returning under-18s and the proposal in Clause 20 to prosecute them for failure to comply with the removal process increases the urgency to provide special guidance for those adjudicating on children's cases.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para20"></a>In short, the complaints that the amendments seek to remedy are that the clause is too broad in its description of the offence, is loose in terms of data protection, and prompts grave concerns about the breaching of confidentiality, with the prospect of <P>


<a name="column_724"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 724</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people being returned to a country that may not be safe for them, where information may then be used against them. There are other concerns about how children are to be handled, and a very real concern about the impropriety of compelling documentation before the final resolution of an asylum claim or appeal.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para21"></a>I hope that the Minister does not think that because we have concertinaed these matters together, we are in any way casual about any of those issues. The clause represents an important and a large extension of powers, and we believe that the amendments that we have suggested put a necessary limit on those powers without denying the Government all the extensions that they require for an effective return of people whom they wish to remove from the country. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord McNally, for his billet doux, which was gratefully received. He has not been in the least bit casual in his explanation of the amendments. I shall try to give as comprehensive an answer as I can, because I understand the noble Lord's worries. I understand, too, that Amendments Nos. 36B and 36C would mean that we would not require, with the prospect of criminal sanction, a person to take certain steps with a view to obtaining a travel document if he or she had an outstanding asylum or human rights application or outstanding appeal.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para22"></a>The offence is all about encouraging people to co-operate with the process of redocumentation so that they may be returned home. Our aim is not to imprison people. The offence is aimed at stopping people from being obstructive. Only in the most extreme circumstances would we want to prosecute people; clearly we would far rather remove them.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para23"></a>Our starting point is that we want to remove people with no basis to stay in the United Kingdom as soon as we can; in most cases, that will be after their appeal rights have been exhausted, but in some cases removal is lawfully possible before that stage&#151;in the case of NSAs, for example.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para24"></a>When someone arrives in the United Kingdom without a passport, they cannot be removed until a travel document is obtained on their behalf. A country will issue it only if it is satisfied of both the true identity and nationality of the person concerned. As I am sure noble Lords know, different countries have different requirements, but most require the co-operation of the person concerned; for example, in providing biometric data, information about friends and family, or even attending an interview. It is a lengthy process and we want to start it as soon as we can.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para25"></a>If a person does not co-operate with the provision of this information or provides information that is false or incomplete, a travel document is unlikely to be issued and the person may not be removed from the United Kingdom, potentially indefinitely. So there is a strong incentive for non-compliance. The provision refers to taking specified action only if the Secretary of State believes that that action will enable a travel <P>


<a name="column_725"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 725</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>document which will facilitate the person's removal from the United Kingdom to be obtained. That is made clear by subsection (1).
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para26"></a>We would therefore not usually require actions to be taken with the prospect of criminal action until after an initial decision has been made. For those with asylum appeals outstanding, we believe that many of the listed actions are ones that we can reasonably expect a person to take. It is rare for a person to be required to attend an interview at an embassy at this stage but, if we do require this, we make it clear to the person that he is not required to answer any questions relating to any asylum application that he may have made.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para27"></a>The offence provided for by Clause 20 is committed if a person fails to take action without a reasonable excuse. Thus we would be unlikely to prosecute those who had a reasonable excuse for not undertaking the actions required. This should ensure that someone who may have been requested to do something that in his particular circumstances could be deemed to be too restrictive would not have committed the offence. Restricting this offence would, we believe, mean that some of its efficacy would be lost. As the Committee will know, obstructing redocumentation is a serious barrier to removal and undermines immigration control, so we need to be robust about the measures to combat it.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para28"></a>Amendment No. 36D seeks to specify what should normally be considered a reasonable excuse for failure to co-operate with an interview or other information-gathering procedure. First and foremost, we do not consider this offence to be the type of offence for which it is appropriate to include a list of reasonable excuses of which people could avail themselves. It is for the prosecution to prove that the person did not take the step and does not have a reasonable excuse for failing to do so. It is something better left to the circumstances of each individual case and eventually to the courts to decide whether or not it has been made out.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para29"></a>There are no means of determining what the minimum level of information required for identification or redocumentation, or both, would be. The purpose of the interviews to which the amendment refers is satisfactorily to establish identity and citizenship or nationality. Requirements will vary from country to country and with each individual. As a result the type and depth of information required is judged on the details of each individual case.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para30"></a>In relation to the verbal notice, we do not currently give verbal notice of the timing and purpose of any redocumentation interviews that a person may be required to attend to establish identity and nationality or citizenship with a view to issuing a travel document that will facilitate his deportation or removal from the United Kingdom. Knowledge of the nature of questions to be asked at the interview is not crucial since the person attending will know its general purpose and what he is there to do. Where, for example, a person is asked at such an interview to provide written material of which he was not <P>


<a name="column_726"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 726</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>forewarned it would be reasonable for that person not to hand it over then but to provide it after the interview once he had had the chance to obtain it.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para31"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 36E, which seeks to limit the actions that a person can be required by the Secretary of State to take for the purposes of this clause to the eight actions specified in subsection (2). We think that such an amendment is unnecessary because it would hamper the effective use of the provisions of this clause in the future. There is no way that we would seek to ask for a blank cheque to be given to the executive and we do not think that this provides one. As I have explained, subsection (1) limits the scope of the clause and any specified action not covered by subsection (2) could be requested for the purposes of this clause by the Secretary of State only where it was consistent with the scope.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para32"></a>Amendment No. 36F would require statutory guidance, subject to the affirmative order procedure. We think that this amendment is unnecessary. Several of the actions listed are not ones for which detailed guidance, let alone detailed statutory guidance, is appropriate; for example, completing a form accurately and completely, attending an interview and answering questions accurately and completely or making an appointment. These are very basic matters for which we think that guidance would not be helpful. These are the sort of requirements that are susceptible to a common-sense assessment.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para33"></a>Where a person is not complying with a process that we consider he should be complying with, our efforts will go first and foremost into persuading the person to comply. So there is no risk of someone being landed with a criminal charge out of the blue. We will make clear to him what we expect to be done and the consequences of failing to do it. If a person is charged with this offence, it will be for the prosecution to prove in the usual way that he has failed to take the action required. The prosecution authorities would need their own guidance for implementing this offence, as they do for other offences.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para34"></a>I hope that I said, "We do currently give verbal notice". There is some concern that I might have said, "We do not currently give verbal notice". If I did, I did not intend to. We do currently give verbal notice of the timing and purpose of any redocumentation interviews. It was a slip of the tongue if I did not say that earlier.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para35"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will feel that I have given a sufficient response to his concerns to satisfy him that the amendments that he seeks are unnecessary. However, I understand why a proper explanation in relation to these matters was sought, because they influence what is done.

<A NAME="40427-12_spnew4"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Chester: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, can she respond to the issue concerning children that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, raised. As I understand it, this clause will create a new criminal offence that will apply to those above the age of criminal responsibility and therefore to children. <P>


<a name="column_727"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 727</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>There are some cases of unaccompanied children who are asylum seekers. It must be a desperate and difficult situation. I also understand that, until recently, the policy has been not to seek to repatriate such people until they are 18 but that the Home Office is now trialing some repatriations of children under the age of 18.
<P>

<a name="40427-12_para36"></a>As things stand, a criminal offence punishable by two years' imprisonment or a fine will be inserted into that dynamic. It is difficult to imagine that there would be any circumstances in which such people would pay a fine. I wonder whether the mere existence of this threat will not unnecessarily complicate the very difficult dynamics of assessing a child with a view to repatriation. The Minister said that only in the most extreme cases would one want to prosecute but sometimes the threat of prosecution can hang in the air and colour the atmosphere. I wonder whether it would not be much better if this new offence were limited to those who are 18 or older.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-13_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am most grateful to the right reverend Prelate for making that point. I am handling a case of this sort at the moment, which has a big risk of a possible infringement of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights like, I imagine, a number of these cases. It is the case of two brothers, one of whom is under age and the other of whom is of age. So one of them is in a position where he can stay and the other is not. This has the effect of separating each of them from the only surviving relation they have in the world, so far as they know. If that is not an infringement of Article 8 of the European convention I would like to know what is. Some relaxation of this policy might save the Government a good deal of legal trouble.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-13_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I apologise for not directly answering the question from the noble Lord, Lord McNally, about the application of Clause 20 in relation to children. I hope that I can reassure the right reverent Prelate the Bishop of Chester and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that although we do not think that there is a need for statutory guidance, we will be publishing guidance on how Clause 20 is to be applied. That guidance will cover any issues specific to children that we think is necessary. I should emphasise that the most important aspect of this process is to gain the full co-operation of those whom we are proposing to remove so that we can make the process as humane, painless and appropriate as we can.

<P>
<P>

<P>

<a name="40427-13_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40427-13_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 36H. Clause 21 provides for electronic monitoring of people who are granted temporary admission or release, or who are released on immigration bail by a variety of bodies or persons empowered to grant such bail. However, as introduced, the power would not be available where bail was granted by SIAC&#151;the Special Immigration Appeals Commission.
<P>

<a name="40427-13_para8"></a>SIAC's caseload raises different issues from normal immigration casework, and in most cases the person is detained because that is necessary in the interests of national security. Although electronic monitoring technology provides a means of mitigating the risk that an individual will abscond, it may be less useful where the risk is not primarily that the person will abscond if released, but that they may be involved in other activities which pose a threat to national security. For that reason, we initially took the view that the measure would be of little practical application in such cases.
<P>

<a name="40427-13_para9"></a>We have reviewed that position in the light of events since the Bill was introduced, particularly the comments by the Newton committee following its review of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act, and the decision in principle by SIAC in January to grant bail in an individual case subject to the person concerned agreeing to be tagged. We have concluded that, although electronic monitoring may not be a solution in every case, it might be a useful tool in certain circumstances, and it was unnecessary to forgo the possibility of using it where it is considered appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40427-13_para10"></a>As I said, SIAC decided in January to grant bail subject to the person concerned agreeing to be tagged. In so doing, it relied on the provisions of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act. However, not all the cases before SIAC relate to ATCS detainees. The amendments will make the position absolutely clear for all SIAC's cases. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40427-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I support the government amendments. When we debated the report commonly known by the name of my noble friend Lord Newton, I expressed some scepticism on the value of tagging. I subsequently had a conversation with my noble friend, who pointed out that the committee had talked more about electronic monitoring than tagging. I am therefore rather intrigued on two bases.
<P>

<a name="40427-13_para11"></a>First, the Minister appears to talk about tagging and electronic monitoring as the same thing. Will she confirm that they can be very different? Secondly, I certainly became aware after further conversations with my noble friend that electronic monitoring could be of great use if bail were granted. All has been thrown into sharp relief as a result of last week's events. I appreciate that, where a person is under house arrest, electronic monitoring can be of great value. The Minister says that the person may not wish to or be able to abscond, but they may be able to carry out activities that are not conducive to the safety of the public of this country. Will the Minister say a little more? Is she talking about tagging and electronic monitoring separately, or does she consider them to be the same thing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-13_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The noble Baroness is quite right. Electronic monitoring and electronic tagging can be different things. However, the latter is sometimes subsumed within the former. One could say that one method or species of electronic monitoring may be electronic tagging. As she knows, we greatly questioned the utility of the measure, but she is right to say that recent events have put that in sharp relief. We have taken the view that it should not be excluded. It may be of use, so it is appropriate for us to have the power for it to be used in those circumstances where it is deemed appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-13_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   It is a great and unexpected pleasure to be able to welcome an amendment by the Government to the Bill, or to any Bill on the subject. The conflict between the Home Secretary and the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Newton of Braintree, is an important and genuinely difficult one. I have known the noble Lord since long before he first stood for president of the Oxford Union. I do not think that he has ever been accused of being a woolly-minded idealist; he is a thoroughly practical person, and his words deserve attention.
<P>

<a name="40427-13_para12"></a>Where we have the clash between the basic principles of evidence and the basic interests of national security, we have a conflict in which both sides of the case deserve a serious hearing, and in which it is therefore unwise to give automatic priority to one side over the other. To make provision for the possibility of bail in such cases is therefore a very welcome recognition that one case will not be like another, that one set of priorities will not be like another, and that the civil liberties arguments will bear a greater proportion of the weight in some cases than in others. In fact, we should treat cases on their merits, which is how they ought to be treated.

"(c) a reference to material&#151;

(i) includes material subject to legal privilege within the meaning of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (c. 60),

(ii) does not include excluded material or special procedure material within the meaning of that Act, and

(iii) includes material whether or not it would be admissible in evidence at a trial."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-13_para20"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak to government Amendments Nos. 36J, 36K, 36L and 36M. Clause 23 enables the Immigration Services Commissioner, subject to obtaining a court warrant, to enter and search premises. The commissioner will then be able to seize and retain material for which the search was authorised. The current draft of Clause 23 includes the categories of "excluded" and "special procedure" material among the categories of material that the commissioner may seize. The Committee will know that concerns were raised about this issue by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. We have consulted the commissioner on the need for him to be able to seize these categories of material. We have concluded that excluded and special procedure material would not be of value to his investigations. As a result, we propose to amend the Bill to remove these categories from the list of material the commissioner may seize using this new power. I hope that will give even further pleasure to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, in relation to this matter. On that basis, I beg to move.

<A NAME="40427-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   The use of the word "material" in this or any context is rather rare in legislation. It may be my forgetfulness, but has the word "material" which is used here previously been used in a context of this kind?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I believe that it has. The category of excluded material will of course have included material such as personal records&#151;those relating to a person's health, human tissue and so on. It can also be used in relation to journalistic materials. The category of special procedure material includes information acquired or created in the course of business. That is subject to a statutory restriction or undertaking of confidentiality <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>given to a third party. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Renton, will not be disappointed to hear that it is not, I believe, the first time that it has been used in this way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am grateful for that explanation, but I do think it would be worth while between now and Report stage for the noble Baroness, whose penetration we much admire, to have a look at precedents for this. She may be able to improve on it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-14_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The noble Baroness has given me pleasure. It is possible she might have been able to give me a little more, but she has certainly given me some.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para0"></a>On the word "material", I am reminded in this context of the 1558 Act for the militia which, most unwisely, specified precisely what types of weapon everybody coming to musters must bring with them. Fifty years later, every one of those weapons was obsolete. Most of the types of weapons they were supposed to produce had not been invented at the time of the previous Act.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para1"></a>The types of material&#151;and I use the word advisedly&#151; used for the purpose of committing acts of terrorism have changed quite remarkably within my own lifetime, even since I became eligible for the old age pension, which is not a very long time. So I think they needed some kind of general word of this sort.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para2"></a>I am worried by the power to have a general right of search on an arrest, before there is a charge, before anything has been made public, and before there is a defence. It in fact exactly repeats an argument which took place in both Houses in 1628, when it was argued that the King's taking a power to arrest on suspicion and then to search gave him a chance to arrest people against whom he had no evidence whatever and, by dint of the power of search, to create what Sir Thomas Wentworth described as "a springing offence"&#151;one springing solely from what was discovered in a search which would, in any normal circumstances, have been illicit.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para3"></a>I would be very tempted, were I the commissioner, to take some person like Abu Hamza and search his possessions absolutely without the need to prove anything in advance. In fact, I would be itching to do so. However, the more a policeman is itching to exercise a certain power, the more legislators need to think twice about whether he should actually do it. I wonder whether this clause&#151;even with this very welcome restriction&#151;may still on occasion create mischief and, if it does, whether the mischief will or will not be balanced by any good that it might do. How, in fact, where one is measuring a justice against an injustice, does one set about creating tools of measurement? That is perhaps the most difficult question of all.

<a name="40427-14_para4"></a>When this Act is, in the normal course of events, reviewed and reconsidered, I hope that the Government will consider how exactly this clause has worked. Meanwhile, we have received a crumb from the rich man's table, for which I thank the Minister very warmly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-14_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   It is only for me to say that I beg to move, and to thank the noble Earl for his exposition of the 1628 position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McNally </B>   moved Amendment No. 36JA:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 25, line 7, leave out "or a justice of the peace" 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-14_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40427-14_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: I too am impressed at this outbreak of amity between my noble friend Lord Russell and the Government Front Bench. Although it cannot be recorded in Hansard, the heavens seem to be making their own comment on this strange occurrence.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para8"></a>This amendment has been prompted by the opinion of the Law Society of Scotland. It seeks to ensure that in Scotland a sheriff only, and not a justice of the peace, will be entitled to grant the search warrants referred to in this clause. It is the view of the Law Society of Scotland that the powers to grant warrants under Clause 23 should extend to sheriffs only. Often a justice of the peace will not be legally qualified and may be unfamiliar with the criteria needed to grant such warrants. Given that the warrants are to investigate serious offences relating to asylum claims, it is in the interests of justice that these warrants are considered and granted by the sheriff.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para9"></a>A similar point was made in relation to search warrants under Clause 67 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill, and it was accepted by the Government that the appropriate authority in Scotland would be the sheriff. The Law Society of Scotland would suggest the position under Clause 23 is analogous to that under earlier legislation and that the appropriate authority to grant these warrants is the sheriff.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para10"></a>It gives me particular pleasure to move the amendment, since the Minister knows full well that I am in total awe of the legal opinions of Scotland. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has moved this amendment because it enables one to express one's doubt, or curiosity at least, as to the use of the expression "justice of the peace" in this context at all.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para11"></a>I must confess that although I was born and educated in England, I am more than half Scotish, and have spent a lot of my life in Scotland. I have noticed that in Scotland not all people who are called justice of the peace ever take part in judicial work. It is a sort of compliment in many cases. Indeed, I have a brother-in-law who has never taken part in any judicial work, but nevertheless is called a justice of the peace. I wonder whether the draftsman, in drafting this subsection, had that in mind. It is a curious position, but we have to get the law right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-14_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Justices of the peace in Scotland have functions related to road traffic arrangements and so forth and, as my noble friend said, many are honorary appointments. However, I was a little surprised to see justices of the peace being given this power because I am not aware that they ever do anything of the kind. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and I would have thought that it was a function of the sheriff. Presumably the clause has been drafted for Scotland, so it will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-14_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am most pleased that the Government have thought to bring the provision into force. We have an example of why devolution was necessary. The majority of Members of the Union Parliament are not expert in the laws of Scotland. In fact, every time I open my mouth about Scottish law, I am conscious that I am giving rise to the west London question. And the west London question is quite as difficult as the West Lothian question and creates quite as many problems.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para12"></a>The institution of justice of the peace was introduced into Scotland by James VI, subsequently James I of England, as part of his plans to assimilate the systems of the kingdoms bit by bit towards each other. I always think of James as King Eric because he proceeded little by little. But the institution of justice of the peace in Scotland was a graft that was imperfectly successful. They never developed as they have done in England&#151;they never had anything like the same power&#151;and the reference to justice of the peace, which is meant to apply both sides of the Border, means two very different things one side from the other. Therefore, in this context, it can cause only confusion and I am extremely glad that the Government have thought better of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-14_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   In reply to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, we recognise the position of a justice of the peace in Scotland. It is complicated and some have signing powers while others do not. Both the noble Lord, Lord Renton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, recognised that.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para13"></a>However, the effect of the amendment would be to prevent a justice of the peace from issuing warrants in Scotland and reserving the responsibility solely to the sheriff. We consulted colleagues from the Scottish Executive and the Office of the Advocate General and we maintain that sheriffs and justices of the peace should have the power to issue warrants of this kind.
<P>

<a name="40427-14_para14"></a>Justices of the peace are able to grant warrants for entry in other parts of immigration legislation and, indeed, in non-immigration legislation. We think it important to maintain consistency within the immigration legislation. The only legislation where this power is reserved for sheriffs alone deals with terrorism or firearms offences. We would not consider those issues to be analogous to the statutory responsibilities of the commissioner.

"( ) No fee shall be prescribed using the powers conferred in this section unless the Secretary of State had first given at least three months' notice of his intentions and consulted with bodies and individuals appearing to him to represent the interests of those affected."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-15_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 37, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 38 to 40 and 40A. I tabled them in response to concern expressed by those in the education world that the Bill signals an intent to introduce charges for visa applications which will harm student recruitment, damage efforts to widen access to education and create further burdens for students who are already making great financial contributions.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para9"></a>We are specifically not talking here about the kind of students who hit the headlines of the tabloids as a result of the press release by the Home Secretary, Mr Blunkett, last Thursday. His press release referred to the few language schools which are accused of accrediting students who should not qualify for visas as they do not attend courses. My amendments have nothing to do with those persons. They refer to the 80,000 or more fee-paying students who contribute to our economy.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para10"></a>A summary of the concerns can be put as follows. It is argued, first, that the fees provided for in Clause 27 should not apply to international students or dependants; secondly, that the international student market is worth an estimated 5 billion a year to the UK economy; thirdly, that international students contribute through income tax and national insurance contributions for part-time and vacation work; and, fourthly, that there have been some negative experiences from the introduction in 2003 of immigration application charges which have failed to lead <P>


<a name="column_735"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 735</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to an improved service. In short, to introduce overcharging for students would be short-sighted and would risk alienating the international student market.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para11"></a>The fees for extensions to and variations of leave under the 1999 Act were introduced only last summer. Students are one of the groups worst affected by the charges, despite the fact that education is one of our vital exports. Students now face the prospect of having to pay an entry tax to the Exchequer for the privilege of coming here to study.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para12"></a>I notice that in the order introduced in this House by the Minister last Friday, which covers the registration of those who will arrive from the A8 countries from this Saturday to work here as employees, the Government have introduced a charge of only 50 to cover administration costs. The Minister then made the point that the registration facilities will also cover students who come to work here as well. It strikes me as an intriguing juxtaposition that while on Friday we were talking about administrative costs being 50, here we are talking about students having to pay fees at a higher rate. I wonder why there is such a great difference between the two charging levels.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para13"></a>I am grateful to Jo Clough, international director of the Association of Colleges, and to Dr Anil Seal, director of the Cambridge Trusts, for their briefing on these issues. Other Members of the Committee may refer to the Cambridge Trusts' briefings, so I will leave that to one side and to others to do greater justice to it than I can. I shall refer to the briefing from the Association of Colleges.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para14"></a>The AoC points out that further education colleges have made a significant contribution to meeting the challenging targets for international student recruitment that were set by the Prime Minister's initiative of 2000. They have already exceeded the target of 50,000 set for 2005. At the start of the Prime Minister's initiative, the Government supported the move to a more streamlined and flexible visa application process. However, the AoC is concerned that the introduction of entry fees of up to 500, and charges of between 155 and 250 for visa extensions for students, therefore creates the distinct impression that the Home Office has now departed from the Prime Minister's initiative partnership approach to international student recruitment.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para15"></a>That would seriously undermine all that our institutions have been doing so assiduously to meet the Prime Minister's targets and could force many potential students to look towards competitor countries, such as the United States, Canada and Australia. Can the Minister confirm that similar points were made at the October 2003 conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers, hosted by the UK in Edinburgh, where several Commonwealth Ministers strongly urged Her Majesty's Government to reconsider these recent decisions on their nationals seeking an overseas education, otherwise, they will simply go elsewhere?

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para16"></a>I turn briefly to the text of the amendments. Amendment No. 37 relates to consultation. On Second Reading, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, stated that Clause 27 sets out an "enabling power", but he said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the charges themselves will be phased in over a number of years, possibly at differing rates, and not without wider consultation"".&#151;[Official Report, 15/3/04; col. 53.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-15_para17"></a>
So is that an undertaking that an order will not be laid before Parliament until that wider consultation has been satisfactorily completed? 
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para18"></a>When what is now Section 5 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which provides for cost recovery charges, was in Committee in another place, the then Minister of State said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are looking for ways to encourage more students to come in . . .  We shall consider proposals for students in due course, when regulations are introduced. It would be appropriate to discuss the detail of specific categories of fees, and the figures, in a debate on those regulations".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Special Standing Committee, 15/4/99, cols. 555&#150;563.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-15_para19"></a>
Contrary to what was said in 1999, and ignoring their own consultation protocol&#151;there was no prior consultation or publicity&#151;the Government introduced regulations just before the Summer Recess last year, which of course is the worst possible time for students. It is important to try to avoid repeating that mix-up by ensuring that proper notice is given of the timing of the introduction of new charges, and that no regulations or orders are made without advance consultation.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para20"></a>Amendment No. 38 would ensure that fees in excess of the actual cost of determining the application would not be charged to students and others mentioned in my amendment, or their dependants. It is mainly a probing amendment to discover how the Government intend the provisions to affect students and their dependants.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para21"></a>Amendment No. 39 raises the point that students are the group most likely to have to make multiple applications in order to complete a programme of studies here, because of the way in which the system operates. Amendment No. 40 ensures that errors can be rectified.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para22"></a>When the 1999 Act was first considered in this House, an amendment to Section 5 was considered that no fee should be charged if an application was made necessary by a mistake of the Secretary of State or his agents. The then Minister, now Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, promised:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We shall ensure that when fee regulations are made, appropriate provision is made to deal with errors which may occur".&#151;[Official Report, 12/7/99, col. 49]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-15_para23"></a>
It later became clear that the Act had been drafted to preclude the making of such provision under the regulations. I hope that the Minister will be able to put that right. We want the Home Office to consider being able to waive fees where applications are necessary only to correct mistakes. That is the purpose of Amendment No. 40. 
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para24"></a>Amendment No. 40A is on a slightly different tack, but I thought it was right to table the amendments all together. It has been put down to ask the Government whether they intend to accept the recommendation of <P>


<a name="column_737"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 737</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in paragraph 6 of its twelfth report. It states that Clause 27 is a significant extension of existing powers and that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where power is conferred to prescribe a fee payable for an application or similar process, it is normally implied that the fee relates to the cost of the service provided. But the power to include an element to 'reflect benefits that . . .  are likely to accrue' gives a very wide discretion, the exercise of which could be significant in terms of policy generally and those affected in particular. We therefore recommend that fees prescribed in exercise of the new powers should be subject to affirmative procedure".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-15_para25"></a>
I therefore tabled this amendment rather late last week, as I said when dealing with an earlier group, when I became aware that the Government did not intend to table it themselves. I have done so simply as a probing amendment to give them the opportunity to say what their response is to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, as obviously we are aware that the Government normally take those recommendations very seriously indeed. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Morris of Aberavon: </B>   I rise to support the spirit of the amendments introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, Amendments Nos. 37, 38, 39, 40 and 40A. As is the custom of the House, I declare an interest as Chancellor of the University of Glamorgan, as well as honorary fellowships I am proud to hold at Caius College Cambridge and three colleges of the University of Wales.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para26"></a>There is a great dependence these days in our universities on attracting foreign students, and they go out of their way to go to distant parts to attend fairs. Only last week I was in Mexico City and was told of the immense efforts made there by the British Council in their fairs attracting thousands of young people to attend. Indeed, they had targets to achieve, which had been laid down to them, for what they should hope to get. They were in severe competition with the United States, Australia, and many other countries. This kind of charging regime can only put off students from coming here. In any event, if we believe in joined-up government, where does the national interest lie? Why should students from developing countries in particular not be encouraged to come here and return to contribute to their home countries?
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para27"></a>I shall briefly refer to two reports that have come to hand, which give the bigger picture of where the national interest lies. One was launched last Tuesday by the British Council, entitled The Global Value of Education and Training Exports to the UK Economy. It has estimated the value to the United Kingdom of education export of some 10 billion, of which higher education provides some 4 billion, putting some methodological rigour behind the argument that international students in the UK should not suffer a further charge for the benefit of UK services, since they already contribute enormously to the economy.
<P>

<a name="40427-15_para28"></a>There is a second report to which I shall briefly refer, Vision 2020, an important forecast of international student mobility. It concludes that demand for places <P>


<a name="column_738"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 738</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in English-speaking universities will soar, that the number of international students in the UK is likely at least to double by 2020, and that the great majority of the demand will come from Asia, particularly China. It is inevitable, certainly in the view of Cambridge University, that such students will be put off coming to the UK by high financial barriers and that the Bill will do the UK no favours by allowing for such charges to be levied.

<A NAME="40427-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lewis of Newnham: </B>   I declare an interest as the chairman of the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust and of the Cambridge Overseas Trust. The trusts sponsor approximately 2,000 of the 4,500 overseas postgraduate students in Cambridge, so they have substantial involvement.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para0"></a>Before I discuss the details of the amendment, I ask the Minister to comment on the degree of consultation that has taken place with the higher education sector. That undertaking was made when the topic was aired initially by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, in Starred Questions. It is important to know exactly what information we have in that direction.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para1"></a>As has been said by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, the changes suggested in the Bill surely are inconsistent with the Prime Minister's recently declared initiative to encourage more students from overseas to study in Britain. The initiative has been taken up by the British Council, which is developing a policy to support that view in establishing Education UK as a world-leading brand. An announcement was made last week, and a position has been given in today's Times, which I shall quote, on exactly what has been happening in this area. It shows that the UK has the second-biggest share of the global market, falling just behind the USA for postgraduate students. I know that figures always differ when one talks about finance, but the figure given is that the share is worth up to 11 billion directly with a further 12 billion indirectly. That probably covers students other than those at postgraduate level.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para2"></a>I have little doubt that the extra cost of visa fees would fall either on government funding of overseas students or on charitable sponsors. In the case of the Cambridge trusts, if the fee were set at 200, which is the sort of figure that has been mentioned, that would involve approximately half a million pounds extra. That could be paid only at the expense of other postgraduate awards. I have little doubt that students would then go elsewhere. It is very important to recognise that much research, certainly in science and engineering in Cambridge, is very dependent on postgraduate students. At present, they comprise approximately two-thirds of the workforce. I am sure that this proposal would influence that resource significantly.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para3"></a>There are 35,000 international students undertaking research in British universities. It is anticipated that that figure will double by 2020. However, as is evident from the present situation in the US, where the fee structure has now changed, the number of applicants has dropped significantly. I cannot talk about the <P>


<a name="column_739"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 739</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>overall number but only about departments. In Chemistry, for example, numbers have dropped by as much as 50 per cent of the initial figures. Obviously, that means that there is high sensitivity to how visas are used.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para4"></a>There is a major problem with the present arrangements for issuing or extending a visa. Any student making a direct application must visit one of four centres&#151;at Croydon, Birmingham, Liverpool and Glasgow. At present, Cambridge students tend to attend the Croydon centre, which has involved very long waiting times. We are told of queues starting at 6 a.m., which means that students must get to the centre by that time from somewhere such as Cambridge. Obviously, that involves considerable difficulty with travel arrangements. That position must be even more acute for less well-placed universities; for instance, those in the south west. As suggested by Oliver Letwin, the former Shadow Home Secretary, could not something be done to return to the efficient scheme of the past, using regional centres liaising directly with universities to deal with the more straightforward cases of visa renewal? I am sure that that would reduce considerably the problems experienced by students, who are not necessarily in a highly mobile position.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para5"></a>It is important to recognise that in taking overseas students we are educating the elite of many other nations. Exposing them to the British culture and values will influence their approach, not only in the immediate future, but in the long term, and certainly from a business point of view.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-16_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns, for introducing these valuable amendments. I agree with practically everything that she and the noble Lord, Lord Lewis of Newnham, have said. However, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said one thing with which I did not agree. She said that fees were normally levied to meet administrative costs and match them. In the past that has been true, but in a period when one is dominated by a low taxation philosophy, it ceases to be true. It ceased to be true in the period roughly from 1590 to 1620, and during my lifetime.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para6"></a>The first case of which I know&#151;although I am sure that it was not the first&#151;in which it was applied during my lifetime was about 12 years ago, for photographic copies from the Public Record Office. As the policy of relying on fees for general taxation always does, it diverts the anger from the government on to those who must collect the fees. As I once said of Queen Elizabeth I, she left her officials to collect the unpopularity. In the Public Record Office, that had created such feeling that employees stuck up beside the photocopying machine a Hansard extract of an Answer to a Starred Question in this House by Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone, the then Lord Chancellor, in which he admitted frankly that photocopying charges had been fixed, not to cover the costs of photocopying, but to meet the general expenses of running the Public Record Office. Increasingly, I am forming the <P>


<a name="column_740"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 740</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suspicion that one of the big objections to a low taxation philosophy is that it costs the average taxpayer in one way and another a great deal more than meeting the costs out of taxation. This is such an example.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para7"></a>Although the whole Committee knows that I am constantly concerned with the financial hardship of students, we are dealing with almost the only group in the British Isles capable of making students look rich. To ask for relief from these fees for students only is to create an artificially privileged class where there is no justification for work. It is an uncommon experience for students, and it might be nice for them to enjoy it just once in a blue moon, but it would be a little tough on the others.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para8"></a>We heard yesterday about applicants who had become victims of Clause 55 and left destitute. We were reminded that a number of their applications were in the end successful; their cases were found to be perfectly good, even though the applications were submitted late. The Home Office by now ought to have absorbed, although clearly it has not, the principle that in-country applications and late applications are just as likely to be good and successful as those made at the courts&#151;in fact, on balance, over the years, slightly more so.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para9"></a>I do not see, when someone has become a victim of Clause 55 and has been left destitute, out of what he is to pay the fee. If he must pay the fee to get asylum, he will have been given a judgment that he has a perfectly valid right to asylum and will not be able to take it up. He may be returned to his own country, when the court has recognised that he has a right to remain here. That is the most unfortunate consequence of the policy of using fees as a method of taxation. Asylum seekers subject to the clause, once they recognise that they are being taxed, are perfectly entitled to say, "No taxation without representation". Once they have citizenship, they earn British income and they pay British taxes. Then they can pay fees; but to charge them fees while denying them all means of income seems unreasonable in the extreme. I can see that it may satisfy some particular form of Whitehall theology; but I cannot see it working in the real world.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para10"></a>That is why we on these Benches have gone for deleting the whole clause altogether. We think that it is an unjust policy, impractically pursued, but if we cannot have the whole loaf, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has found a particularly appetising little bit of the crust. We would certainly rather settle for that than for nothing. I am grateful to her for moving the amendment.

<A NAME="40427-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wilson of Tillyorn: </B>   I join the voices of those who support these amendments, whether they are crust, crumb or whole loaf. In doing so, I declare an interest, first as the master of a Cambridge college, and secondly as chancellor of one of the ancient universities of Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para11"></a>There have been several references already to the Prime Minister's initiative in 1999. At that time, I was a member of the board of trustees of the British <P>


<a name="column_741"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 741</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Council. I remember thinking that the objective put forward by the Prime Minister, of increases in the number of students from outside the European Union of 50,000 in higher education, and 25,000 in further education, by 2005, was wildly overoptimistic. However, as has been said this evening, that objective has already been achieved, thanks to a huge amount of effort from government departments, including the Foreign Office, and the British Council.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para12"></a>For me, the most striking figures in those increases are ones in which I happen to take a close personal interest; that is the increase in the number of students coming here from mainland China. In 1999, at the time of the Prime Minister's initiative, there were 6,050 students coming to the UK from mainland China. In 2002&#150;03, the last year for which there are figures, the number was 31,900. Similarly, there have been increases in the numbers coming from Hong Kong&#151;some 1,600&#151;and from Taiwan&#151;some 1,300. In fact, as I walk round the streets of Cambridge and listen to people talking, my impression is that, apart from English spoken in a variety of different forms, the most common language spoken in the streets of Cambridge is Chinese, either Mandarin or Cantonese.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para13"></a>The essence of the whole thing is not just China. As others have said, is it a good thing or a bad thing to increase the numbers of students coming here from overseas? Is it in the national interest to encourage that or not? For all the reasons that have already been stated by a number of noble Lords, I come down firmly on the side of those who think that it is very much in our national interest to encourage overseas students to come here. We benefit from talented graduate research students, as my noble friend Lord Lewis has just said. We benefit financially to a high degree, as noble Lords have said. Speaking from the point of view of a small college in Cambridge, we benefit from the mix of people that we have coming to the college from all over the world.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para14"></a>Finally, as has already been suggested, we benefit from the fact that&#151;we hope&#151;when those people go home they have enjoyed their time in the United Kingdom and they are lifelong friends of this country. Surely those things are good and should be encouraged. I share the view of those noble Lords who have said that charging fees&#151;particularly if there is no clear limit on what those fees should be&#151;on things like visas for overseas students to come here, is bound to be a deterrent. It is bound to be a deterrent in an atmosphere when other countries are extremely competitive in this field: Australia; New Zealand; Canada; and those continental European countries that are increasingly using English as a language of instruction.
<P>

<a name="40427-16_para15"></a>We are in a very competitive market. If we are in that competitive market, and if it is in our national interest to encourage overseas students to come here, we should be putting out a mat with a welcome sign on it, and not pulling down a portcullis, whether a Westminster portcullis or any other form.

<A NAME="40427-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve: </B>   I will speak to these amendments, but I will confine my comments to the amendment that is not specifically concerned with <P>


<a name="column_742"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 742</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>students. In Amendment No. 40, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has proposed that provision be made for the possibility of refunding fees in those cases where there is error, maladministration, loss of papers and the like. Clearly, that does not apply only to students. My experience in this area arises out of the fact that, as head of a Cambridge college, and in other academic contexts, I have frequently had to deal with the visa problems not only of our overseas students, but of our overseas academic visitors at every stage of their career.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para0"></a>It has been a humiliating experience. Whatever the background citizenship, whether it be eastern Europe, or New Zealand or Australia, there has been an excessive experience of delay; of discourtesy; of lost papers; of being summoned to Lunar House in Croydon and queuing from 6 a.m. through the day and not seeing anyone; of not being told the name of the officer dealing with the papers; and finally, of lost passports. Original documents must be sent, and when they are mislaid and no account is given, people are unable to attend to their normal academic business. They cannot attend conferences overseas, and they cannot attend job interviews overseas. They are in the most appalling position. I wish that I could say that this is uncommon, but my experience has been that it is not at all uncommon.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para1"></a>As other methods for improving the efficiency of Lunar House, and possibly other parts of the system, have not worked&#151;I speak only of Lunar House because my repeated experiences have been of Lunar House&#151;perhaps there should be a system of fines, by which there was a need to refund not merely the fee, but possibly the damages incurred when people cannot attend job interviews elsewhere, and cannot go home and must support themselves for additional periods in this country. These are serious matters, and Clause 40 needs particular consideration.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para2"></a>I emphasise that noble Lords who have stressed the economic opportunity that we have in this area have not pointed to one feature of that opportunity. The United States is in the business of cracking down on the issue of student visas&#151;and I know about that at first hand also because we send students overseas&#151;in a way that is time consuming, expensive, and difficult to get right. I suspect that the United States will damage its overseas recruitment in consequence, and that is an opportunity for us, if we could but get it right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-17_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   I will not repeat anything that has been ably said on behalf of the universities, but I will make one additional point. One of my noble friends mentioned that we are supporting an elite in the developing world. There is a common perception that we are aiding students who have very wealthy parents, and giving them opportunities. I am speaking of students from the Middle East, Singapore, or Hong Kong. It is not like that. As we know from recent government Answers, student backgrounds are widely spread. My noble friend Lord Wilson spoke of the UK gaining many more students from China than before. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>We must be careful that this Bill does not discriminate against African countries and those from more deprived backgrounds.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-17_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Liverpool: </B>   I support the amendments. I declare an interest as co-president of Liverpool Hope University College and also as chairman of the council of Wycliffe Hall in Oxford. I make one simple point to strengthen the amendment. In our academic institutions in this country, we are at the forefront of interfaith dialogue. It would be a great pity if these measures should alienate potential students, who would benefit enormously from participating in the interfaith dialogue in our universities and colleges, at a time when the world needs to have people with skill and insight in this very important area of conversations between the different faith communities at an international as well as a local level. I support the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-17_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   This is a very strange clause. There seems to have been a great lapse in joined-up government. The Government and the Scottish Executive are extremely keen to help fill the enormous gap in funding in universities by bringing in a lot of overseas students; they do it for financial reasons as well as for all the other reasons that noble Lords gave. In many countries&#151;notably, I think, in the Far East&#151;it is very often governments who fund students, particularly undergraduate students. Vast numbers come to Scotland; the whole movement of overseas students is extremely important in Scotland. Those governments will notice when it is more expensive for students to get visas here than it is in some other countries; they will go elsewhere. There is no question about that.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para3"></a>I will not reiterate anything that has been said; we have had some fairly powerful speeches and I am sure that the noble Baroness has been listening to them with a lot of interest and perhaps been shivering a little in her shoes. I would just say that when the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, of which I am a member, considered this matter it appreciated that the raising of fees&#151;above that which was justified by inflation and the costs of administration&#151;would be a very sensitive matter politically. It is not only in this House that this kind of thing causes what in Scotland is called a stishie; I expect I will have to spell that. This stishie is from the universities, but there will be very strong political feeling throughout the country, and it will be reflected in the House of Commons.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para4"></a>That is why the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee said that it would be better if the matter were properly debated under the affirmative resolution procedure. The noble Baroness will, I hope, tell us that she will table an amendment to that effect. If she does not, we should certainly impose it upon her in this House.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-17_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   If the Minister will permit me, I think I may have unintentionally misled the Committee. I spoke, giving an impression that there was a general fee for anyone being granted asylum. That is not the case. Since I did not mean to say it, I should make clear that it is not true. Under Clause 27(2), fees are payable under the British Nationality Act for applications for leave to remain, and that in particular may concern a lot of people who are subject to Section 55; under Sections 10 and 122 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, for entitlement to right of abode and fees for work permits. It is not all asylum seekers, but it goes a long way beyond students.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para5"></a>I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill, for saying what she did about the effect of retention of documents. I have come across far more cases than I care to remember, and it was high time that that was put into the parliamentary record. I also remember the deterrent effect of queuing for a US visa when I was going the other way. I could have written a substantial article in the time I spent doing that, and I sometimes wish I had.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-17_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I say to the noble Earl that I of course accept his amendment; I would otherwise have to have gently pointed out to him that on this rare occasion he had perhaps not fully understood the position.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para6"></a>The Government very much understand the import of the comments made by a number of noble Lords about the importance of students. I agree wholeheartedly with what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Wilson, about the change that has been brought about as a result of the Prime Minister's initiative. We do not believe that these provisions will undermine that. It is important to remember, further to what the noble Lord, Lord Wilson, said, that the initiative has been an overall success. I understand that in higher education there were 109,940 students in 1996&#150;97; by 2001&#150;02, there were 142,350 students. During that time in further education numbers rose from 25,102 to 47,995, so we are moving towards the 2005 targets with a high degree of success.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para7"></a>I also agree with the comments that were made about the importance of not having disincentives for students, especially poor students, as mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich. He is right to say that those who come to this country as students are from a very mixed economic background. We recognise therefore the concerns that poor students may have and we do not intend this power to be a drain, or to make it hard to raise funding for scholarships and other grants. Again, we will operate this power sensibly and proportionately; we want to continue to attract the students.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para8"></a>In shortened version, before turning to the precise amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, I say to the noble Baroness that the Prime Minister's initiative to encourage overseas students is maintained; that no decisions have yet been taken on how the fees will operate; and that we intend to consult and will take into account all the points made about students. We retain <P>


<a name="column_745"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 745</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the ability to exempt or apply lower fees to students if results of consultations suggest that that is a better course of action.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para9"></a>Other Ministers before me have given an apology for the way in which consultation took place on the last occasion. We have done so without reservation. We understand therefore the anxiety that there has been about the lack of consultation last time; we recognise that we did not undertake sufficient consultation; we have learnt the lessons from that and our intention on this occasion is that there should be a full consultation. I hope that the noble Baroness accepts that abject apology about those matters and that we can look to the future. The noble Baroness will know that it was not intentional. There has been a whole explanation for them from the Dispatch Box as to how and why it occurred, and regrets were expressed on the last occasion.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para10"></a>It is right that my noble and learned friend Lord Morris raised the issue about the support and anxieties he has in this regard. I acknowledge his fine reputation as the Chancellor of the University of Glamorgan and his association with all of Wales. It is a truly important issue.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para11"></a>I turn to the amendments. Amendment No. 37 will require the Secretary of State to consult interested parties three months in advance of prescribing the fee under Clause 27. The principle of consultation when introducing new fees is a sound one, as I made clear, and one which the Government support. We have stated on record on a number of occasions&#151;including during the Committee stage of the Bill in another place and at Second Reading in this House&#151;that we will consult fully on our proposals to introduce a fee before exercising this power, backed up by a full regulatory impact assessment. We intend to launch such a consultation in the autumn of this year.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para12"></a>However, we do not believe that it is necessary or desirable to prescribe that in statute. If there were circumstances in which it was appropriate to make a small increase of the fee&#151;for example, to take account of inflation, or to reduce the charges for any reason&#151;we would be bound by an unnecessary layer of administration, which is in the interests neither of our customers nor of the taxpayer. As the clause is drafted, we have the flexibility to consult as necessary, and we are committed to doing so.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para13"></a>Similarly, with regard to Amendment No. 40A, although I note the concern of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform that the clause gives a wide discretion, I assure the Committee that a range of safeguards is already in place to ensure that any fees levied under the clause are fair and proportionate and do not discriminate against or deter potential applicants. We have purposely limited the scope of the power, which applies only to applications for which a charge can be set under the statutory provisions specified in the clause. It will not apply to applications for leave to remain based on asylum or ECHR grounds. Nor will it apply to the transfer of conditions&#151;I refer to Clause 28&#151;or to visa or entry clearance applications made overseas in British consulates, for example by students applying for prior entry clearance abroad.
<P>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 746</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para14"></a>The power will be exercised only with the express consent of the Treasury, except in respect of applications for certificates of entitlement to the right of abode under Section 1 of the Consular Fees Act 1980. The reason for this latter exception is that such fees are made by an Order in Council&#151;that is, with the agreement of the Privy Council. It is not usual to require Treasury consent in those circumstances. I have already made the commitment to consult all interested parties before the introduction of any new fees using the power.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para15"></a>Amendment No. 38 would exempt specified categories of applicant from the charges. Amendment No. 39 would ensure that, if subject to such a fee, such applicants should pay only once in any 10-year period. I am sympathetic to the intention behind the amendments. It is right that the people whom we want to attract to the United Kingdom&#151;students, healthcare providers, academics&#151;and whom we benefit from should not be deterred from coming to this country. I reassure the noble Lords, Lord Lewis of Newnham and Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, the noble Earls, Lord Russell and Lord Sandwich, the noble Baronesses, Lady O'Neill of Bengarve and Lady Carnegy of Lour, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool&#151;all of whom raised the issue&#151;that we have that very much in mind. However, we do not believe that we should go so far as to prescribe in primary legislation certain rather selective categories of exemptions. I note, for example, that there is no mention of teachers. I fear that many applicants would regard themselves as prospective students, if the opportunity for avoiding payment presented itself.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para16"></a>In fact, we already have the power to provide for exemptions, given that fees set using the power in Clause 27 will be specified in statutory instruments made under the existing fee-setting powers referred to in Clause 27. Those fee-setting powers enable the Secretary of State to make exemptions, and that ability applies equally to fees set at an above-cost level. That provides us with the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances rather than having to attempt to classify exemptions in the Bill and, I suggest, is the more appropriate place to do so, should we feel that such exemptions were necessary.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para17"></a>Amendment No. 39 would limit the number of times that certain categories of applicant would be required to pay. As I say, I understand the concern that applicants will be required to pay repeatedly for extensions to their leave, for example, and that such sums would be far in excess of the benefits accruing to the applicant. I assure the Committee that the intention of the clause is in no way to extort payment out of people unfairly. We will be alive to that concern in the implementation of our proposals. However, there may well be circumstances in which a person or company applies for further leave to remain or for an extension to a person's work permit, where the benefits accruing to the applicant are clear. For example, a student may complete his or her course of study, find a job in the United Kingdom and wish to switch to a work permit category. In those circumstances, it would not be unfair or unreasonable to reflect in the fee the additional benefits that the individual would enjoy.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para18"></a>Amendment No. 40 would make express provision for a general discretion to waive or refund leave-to-remain fees in cases of maladministration or mistakes, delays and so on. I can understand the wish to ensure that, if an error has been made, IND customers should not have to pay for it to be rectified. We have made changes in our operations to ensure that, in clear cases of maladministration, the error is corrected without charge. If a fee has been paid, an ex gratia payment is made. The power to make an ex gratia payment in cases of maladministration exists independently of the charging legislation. There is therefore no need to make express provision for it in Section 5 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para19"></a>We are putting in place a central point of contact for correcting errors and a facility to accept a single payment for multiple applications. Officials are working hard to minimise the necessity to correct errors by ensuring that those applying for entry clearance or leave to remain&#151;for example, as students&#151;are granted the correct leave at the outset. All claims for redress in cases of maladministration are considered in accordance with the government accounting manual and a consolatory payment framework for non-financial loss that has been agreed with the Parliamentary Ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para20"></a>I hope that I have succeeded in reassuring the Committee that we will not undertake to operate the power in Clause 27 without consultation and full regard to the impact that it may have on potential applicants and other interested parties, including universities, UK businesses and local communities.
<P>

<a name="40427-17_para21"></a>Some noble Lords spoke about the difficulties that students have experienced. The new student batch scheme has been working very well. The batch scheme was introduced to make it easier for mainly university students in a general group who are experiencing a long backlog. The scheme means that a batch of applications comes in from the university via the student adviser. The applications are kept together and returned to the student adviser within two weeks, if possible. The scheme continues to receive considerable praise, despite the problems thrown up as charging beds in. Noble Lords who are intimately connected with universities should consider that scheme and promote it. It will ease many of the problems to which the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill of Bengarve, and others referred.

<A NAME="40427-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am very grateful for the support for my amendments. Those supporters recognised that my amendments were probing amendments and were not perfect for delivering noble Lords' objectives, which were best encapsulated by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, <P>


<a name="column_748"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 748</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who said that we were trying to decide where the national interest lay. We have a clear picture that it lies with ensuring that overseas students come here and contribute to our life and our economy.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para0"></a>In the contributions made by noble Lords, we have seen the difficulty of trying to define in legislation something that satisfies the requirements of the Committee that, while there is access to education for people from throughout the world, the Government should have sufficient flexibility to set fees for applications that may be seen to be reasonable. Noble Lords were not trying to inhibit the Government in the setting of fees. Our concerns were clearly expressed in a way that showed that we were trying not to impede the Government but to facilitate the Prime Minister's initiative and extend further the opening of the gates of our great educational institutions to students from overseas.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para1"></a>It has been a full debate, and it would be wrong of me to try to pick up particular parts of it. I took from what the Minister said that there were, in her remarks, undertakings with regard to full and proper consultation in future on this setting of fees. I noticed she said that there would be the publication of a full regulatory impact assessment, which would be welcome.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para2"></a>I also took the Minister to have given certain undertakings with regard to the introduction of safeguards in the setting of fees. I suspect that that will not be satisfactory for some, but it is important that I can go back to those who briefed me and enable all noble Lords to consider further what the Minister said. Between now and Report, we will examine carefully the undertaking that the Minister gave today to see whether it will meet the concerns. We will see whether, between now and Report, which is not too far off&#151;it is only about three weeks away&#151;the Government will listen further to the concerns of the Cambridge trusts, the Association of Colleges and others, when they have had a chance to consider the matters fully.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para3"></a>The noble Baroness referred to one particular amendment of mine; that is, with regard to errors. She said that there was a separate method of dealing with that and that there could be an ex gratia payment. I accept entirely that that is the case.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para4"></a>The Minister will know that in another place my right honourable friend Oliver Letwin&#151;who, at that time, was shadow Home Secretary&#151;made representations that there needs to be some more force with regard to being able to ensure that there is redress. I was very concerned to hear from the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill, about the experiences of those who suffer in the system; for example, those who lose their passports and suffer damage. There is concern about what recompense should and may be available.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para5"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness who has given significant undertakings with very goodwill. With goodwill, I shall need to look further at what she has said and go back to those who have briefed me. I see that the noble Baroness may wish to add more.

I should be very happy to write a comprehensive letter to all noble Lords who have spoken, which concerns all the issues that were not dealt with as fully as I should have liked because of time limits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-18_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I think that I can deal with this briefly. Clause 28 deals with the case of a person who returns temporarily to another country and needs a stamp certifying that he has the right of abode here transferred to a new passport because the old passport is out of date.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para11"></a>Under the Government's proposals, that attracts a fee which is well beyond the cost of administering the stamp. We ask that it should meet only the cost of the actual application. The Government should not follow the policy of using fees as a form of taxation. If the Government want a disquisition on the difficulties that principle can cause, I could easily take up the rest of the evening on it, but I will not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Of course, I hear what the noble Earl says in relation to this matter. The noble Earl knows, as I have already made clear in earlier answers, that Clause 28 amends Section 5 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 which enables the Secretary of State, with the approval of the Treasury, to make regulations prescribing fees to be paid in connection with certain immigration applications. In particular, Section 5(1)(c) enables fees to be prescribed for applications for an indefinite leave stamp to be transferred into the applicant's passport or travel document as the result of the renewal or replacement of the previous passport or travel document. I think that I dealt earlier, at some length, with why we have put the fee structure as it currently is and the steps that we propose to take in relation to change.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para12"></a>The clause substitutes new Section 5(1)(c), which will enable fees to be prescribed for applications for limited leave stamps, as well as indefinite leave stamps, to be transferred into the applicant's passport or other document issued to the applicant where the leave stamp was previously fixed in another passport or document issued to the applicant.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para13"></a>The clause also replaces Section 5(5) of the 1999 Act, which defines "indefinite leave stamp". Clause 28 is unaffected by the above-cost charging provision in <P>


<a name="column_750"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 750</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 27. The fees for applications to transfer leave stamps will be set under Treasury rules to recover the full administrative cost of processing such applications and no more. Those fees will be prescribed by statutory instrument. Therefore, I hear what the noble Earl says but I still suggest that Clause 28 stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-18_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Perhaps I may have it absolutely clearly that the fee will cover only the administrative cost.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-18_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Under Treasury rules, the fees for applications should recover the full administrative cost of processing such applications and no more.

</TABLE>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-18_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: On 31 March, we had a vigorous debate in this House on the Community Legal Service (Scope) Order 2004 (S.I. 2004/1055). I think that it is fair to say that no speakers other than the Minister felt that those regulations were in the interests of justice. The effect of those regulations was to remove legal aid from the substantive asylum interview, as it is called, which is such an important part of the asylum procedure.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para20"></a>Two exceptions were provided for in those regulations; namely, first, an interview involving a child and, secondly, an interview involving someone with mental incapacity, although that, too, was narrowly defined. During the debate, which starts at col. 1411 of the Official Report on 31 March, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and those who spoke from these Benches, all indicated that if the Government persisted with the order that night, the matter would be brought back as part of this Bill. Indeed, Amendment No. 42 revokes that order.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para21"></a>The importance of the substantive immigration or asylum interview is obvious. Given the recent debate, I shall not speak longer than necessary, but I need to set out the core of the argument. First, the substantive interview forms the key basis of the decision by the senior immigration officer about whether asylum would be granted. Often, that decision is literally a matter of life and death. The fact that there are quite a few bogus asylum seekers should not blind us to the many genuine cases.
<P>


<a name="column_751"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 751</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para22"></a>Of course, that interview being the basis of the first decision becomes the basis of any appeal from that first decision. It is that interview that will go before the adjudicator when and if an appeal is made. In considering the amendment, the issue is whether or not legal representation, given that it is expensive and given that there are limited resources for legal aid, is warranted for those substantive asylum interviews. My first point is that they are no less important than interviews in a police station. Indeed, they are frequently much more important than interviews in a police station. As we all know, those interviews are the subject of legal aid procedures whereby solicitors can represent those interviewed.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para23"></a>Secondly&#151;again, I think that all noble Lords understand this&#151;very often those people going for the interviews are traumatised, in the truest sense of the word, and, if not that, they are often disoriented. Who can be surprised? Frequently, they are inarticulate and do not speak the language or speak it inadequately. We should not forget that with the revocation of legal aid came the revocation of the right to have a translator present. I commend the work of the Refugee Legal Centre, which provides a useful briefing for the House that was summarised at column 1415 of Hansard on 31 March.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para24"></a>But no one will be present to check the efforts of the immigration officer who will be conducting the first interview. One has to make the point that the Government make frequently about the quality of legal representation, that often the quality of the immigration officer leaves much to be desired at the first interview. They are often young and often&#151;how shall I put it?&#151;do not give the would-be asylum seeker a proper chance.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para25"></a>With no one present to assist the asylum seeker there is no one there to improve the quality of the first interview, sort out misunderstandings, make sure that key lines of questioning are pursued and make sure that where they are pursued they are pursued fairly. If the record of the interview that goes to the senior immigration officer for the first decision is inadequate there is no one to check it, apart of course from the asylum seeker, but the asylum seeker is in many cases poorly equipped to check the satisfactory nature of that key interview.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para26"></a>Then there is no one to look over the record of the interview as there is, for example, with the Crown Prosecution Service, who will decide whether the fruits of police work warrant a prosecution&#151;there is no one in an equivalent position.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para27"></a>I refer to the Government's position, which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, David Lammy, kindly set out to me in a letter on 23 April. He made much of the fact that there is now an induction process, as it is called. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Briefing provided as part of the induction process familiarises asylum applicants with IND's procedures and provides detailed briefing on different aspects of the asylum process, as well as making them aware of their own obligations as an asylum seeker".
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para28"></a><P>


<a name="column_752"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 752</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para29"></a>That sounds fine and dandy, but I come back to the general situation that normally prevails of disorientation, lack of linguistic skills, lack of confidence and the rest of it. Then the induction process says about legal advice&#151;I am reading from the script issued by the Home Office of the DVD that all those people have to watch:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You can seek legal advice if you want it; but the Home Office do not believe that you need legal advice to tell Asylum Casework about your reasons for claiming asylum.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-18_para30"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>They will not postpone interviews with you so you can get legal advice or be represented".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-18_para31"></a><P>

<a name="40427-18_para32"></a>I do not think that is an adequate or fair summary of what an asylum seeker should be told under the process. The script later states&#151;and this is fair as far as it goes:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The full interview is your only chance to explain why you fear return to your own country.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-18_para33"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>It is vital you give the interviewing officer all the information you want to be considered and is also your opportunity to provide evidence or papers to do with your application, for example&#151;medical certificates".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-18_para34"></a>
That is fair enough if one is sitting in this Committee or is a professional person and has some idea of what is what in this funny world, but I put it to the Committee that as a warning to the people who have to go through those procedures about what they really entail it is not remotely sufficient. That is why we believe strongly that legal representation is not merely desirable, but essential.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para35"></a>The consequences of not having legal representation by legal aid is that there will be far more appeals, because if someone comes to my office and wants advice having already been the subject of an adverse initial decision, the solicitor instructed is almost bound to say, "Given that you had no one there to look after your interests, and so on, you'd better appeal". When the case goes to appeal it will take longer. That is the point made forcefully by all speakers on 31 March. If that is supposed to save the Exchequer money it will have the reverse effect because there will be more appeals and longer appeals.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para36"></a>I have checked that matter with an experienced adjudicator who in turn took the view of several other adjudicators. I am bound to say that he took precisely that view and said that, in addition, the adjudicators as things stand are frequently deeply unhappy with the calibre of statements that come to them from the first decision-making process and the interview preceding it.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para37"></a>We find the present position extremely strange and counterproductive. It is no answer to say that the representatives are inadequate. One can deal with that by having a necessary vetting process, but at the root of the inadequate representation, everyone knows&#151;it is common knowledge in the legal profession and I am sure I do not need to tell this to the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, who is an experienced lawyer&#151;that the rate of remuneration for those interviews is so parlous that too often inexperienced people attend them. That must be admitted.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para38"></a>This is an important matter in terms of the rule of law and standards in this country. The Lord Chancellor in the Chamber today rightly said that the <P>


<a name="column_753"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 753</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rule of law is paramount in this country, but that is an empty boast unless there is timely and adequate legal representation for those who need it.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para39"></a>I end with a final reference to the letter kindly written to me by the Minister on 23 April. We had made the point, as indeed had the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that the two exceptions to the removal of legal aid are wholly inadequate; for example, what about victims of torture and rape? The Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In relation to further categories of exceptions, such as rape or torture victims, at present, neither the DCA nor the Home Office are persuaded that victims of rape or torture (however defined) should be regarded as being in a category of vulnerable people".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-18_para40"></a>
What does one have to be subjected to in a foreign country in order to come here as a vulnerable person?
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para41"></a>Although it is not the time of night to be voting, I hope that when the noble Baroness responds she has something to say on the matter to avoid a vote at the next stage. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_time1"></a><H5>7.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-18_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   We have here a case where two government desires are incompatible with each other. The Treasury, for some reason I have never understood, feels an intense hatred of the growth of legal aid; whereas if its officials were to examine it in a wider context they would find that the legal aid budget is highly cost effective and saves us a great deal of money in other ways.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para42"></a>But the Treasury has always been extremely resistant to the principle of taking costs net, which leads it into a good deal of error. In fact, sometimes economy can be a very expensive habit. It is not even as if that were some newfangled principle. It descends directly from the right to plead in forma pauperis&#151;in the form of a poor person&#151;which goes back into the mists of the Middle Ages; practically back to the beginning of legal history.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para43"></a>The point is to restore a degree of equality between the privileged and the underprivileged. At the same time, the Government and we on this side would like to see a shortening of the process of application for asylum. Much of the trouble is that it proceeds extremely slowly and painfully. That is overwhelmingly the result of casual errors made in the initial interview. The one from Afghanistan, described in the Home Office as a "pile of pants", is merely a caricature of something with which we are all familiar.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para44"></a>We see that, at present, applicants are not given the opportunity to have their statements read back to them and that they cannot bring interpreters unless they have legal aid. But when the Home Office supplies interpreters, it often provides people who speak a different dialect. Although I shall not go into the case in detail, I know of a client who was supplied with four different Kurdish interpreters. The first three were unable to speak a form of Kurdish which would enable them to understand the client. Let us suppose that someone comes from Croydon and is supplied first with an interpreter from Glasgow and then one from Newcastle. I shall not continue, but it is worse than that.
<P>


<a name="column_754"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 754</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para45"></a>By producing more errors in the first stages of the application, the Home Office is prolonging its own process. It is pickling a rod for its own back. I think that the Home Office has enough rods on its back without needing to manufacture any more. If it allowed for legal aid, proper interpreters and a check of the contents of the interview so that an agreed record was made of what had been said, that would save a great deal of everyone's time and money and would be as much in the interests of the Home Office itself as in those of the client.
<P>

<a name="40427-18_para46"></a>The reason why this proposal has not been adopted is that it is much too sensible, which never helps.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-19_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I was with the noble Earl in understanding the difficulties of interpretation until he mentioned the problem of understanding those from Glasgow, Newcastle and so forth. I must confess that I have never had that difficulty, although the situation may be different in the Kurdish language.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-19_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I have not forgotten an attempt to buy a ticket on a Newcastle bus. The transaction was a complete failure until someone acted as an interpreter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I shall not comment because some may say that it depends on how much you get out.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para0"></a>Amendment No. 42 addresses a serious issue. The noble Earl made an important point about interpreters. I should say to him that we make every effort to ensure that the interpreters made available are versed in the correct dialects because we understand the difficulties that can be caused. Moreover, I understand the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, about the changes we have made. But the noble Lord will know that these changes are part of a wider package of reforms to immigration and asylum legal aid that have been introduced following concerns over the rising costs of such legal aid. They have risen from 81.3 million in 2000&#150;01 to 174.2 million in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para1"></a>At the same time, general concerns have been expressed about the level of control over quality, duplication and waste within the asylum legal aid system. I know that the noble Lord acknowledges that there have been difficulties in relation to quality of service. We are grappling with those matters and, indeed, the professions are seeking to assist us in that effort.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para2"></a>It is right that too many unmeritorious claims were being made and pursued and, to be frank, there were too many suppliers of insufficient quality doing this work. Of course some brilliant lawyers were undertaking work, but that standard was not reflected by all. All that contributed to an increase in costs per case and an unsustainable level of expenditure. I know that Amendment No. 42 seeks to reverse the effect of the Community Legal Service (Scope) Regulations 2004, and I understand all the reasons that have been put forward in support.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para3"></a>Let me explain why the Government introduced the regulations. Previously, funding was available for a representative, usually an agent or outdoor clerk working for a legally aided organisation representing <P>


<a name="column_755"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 755</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an asylum seeker, to attend the substantive interview with the Home Office. However, the Government believe that in the majority of cases this was unnecessary, that it was of no benefit to the client, and that it was a waste of public funds.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-19_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am sorry to intervene again, but the Minister said this on the last occasion. She did not give a reason. I wonder if she could explain to the Committee why she thinks that that was the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I shall be happy to do so. In the majority of cases, the role played by the person accompanying the asylum seeker was simply that of a note-taker, as they were not meant to intervene during the interview. I accept what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. He pointed out that the reason why someone at a junior level perhaps without the skills or acuity to deal with the case went along was because the fee for attending was so low, but we do not accept that someone should be present if they are not working creatively in assisting the applicant. That is why a person should be present.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para4"></a>We recognise that there are important exceptions where it is right that an applicant has his or her representative at the interview. These include unaccompanied minors, applicants going through the fast-track initial decision processes, those suffering from a recognised&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-19_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I rise to ask&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-19_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Perhaps I may finish the sentence: those suffering from a recognised and verifiable mental incapacity which makes it impractical to undergo an interview without support, applicants being interviewed at a police station or under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, or applicants alleged to pose a threat to national security should have an adviser at the interview if they so wish. I give way to the noble Earl.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-19_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness and I am sorry to be persistent. She referred to "only a note-taker". Would she have been happy to make this speech with no representative of Hansard present?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-19_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   It depends on the quality of the note-taking made by myself or others. This is a very different situation. Noble Lords know that Hansard is a document of record which is used in interpretation and is absolutely critical. Any comment made from the Dispatch Box by a government Minister in debate in your Lordships' House must be accurately reflected in the record because it may ultimately be used to interpret statute. So, as I have said, the record is critical. However, we need to be clear that what is encompassed in the initial interview is the applicant being enabled to tell their story. Perhaps I may say that I also accept that the ability of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate caseworker to phrase questions in an open and sympathetic way that will enable the applicant to tell their story is extremely important.

<a name="40427-19_para5"></a>However, someone who is not skilled and who simply sits in the room taking a note does not facilitate that openness. We are trying to ensure that the provision we provide is directed towards where it is needed and can have the most beneficial effect. That is why, when one looks at the work we have done to improve the standard of legal representation and the increased fees that can be paid to those who have the requisite skills&#151;targeting excellence&#151;this is so important. We want those seeking legal representation to have the full benefit of excellent, first-class representation so that they are given proper advice.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para6"></a>The Legal Services Commission has also introduced rules to ensure that in the exceptional cases referred to earlier where attendance at interview is authorised, this will be by the adviser in the case or the immigration supervisor, and not by an agent or an outdoor clerk until the accreditation scheme is compulsory. It is the skill that is necessary here.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para7"></a>The Legal Services Commission, the Department for Constitutional Affairs and my department have undertaken to monitor the effectiveness and success of these regulations to ensure that the non-attendance of representatives at interview in non-exceptional cases does not reduce the level of assurance or access to justice.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para8"></a>The regulations are compatible with rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. This amendment is therefore undesirable as the regulations have removed attendance in unnecessary cases and will help ensure quality representation in the exceptional cases. If the effect of the regulations is reversed, we will lose a significant proportion of projected savings that will enable us to ensure that legal aid is properly targeted on those genuine and complex cases where there is a real prospect of success.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, raised the issue of rape and torture victims not being included in the exceptions. That is not necessarily incompatible with presenting their cases. If they can show that they are suffering from a mental incapacity as a result of torture or rape, the interview will be permitted. We have said that we will monitor the effect of the regulations and we can reconsider them if it is shown to be necessary.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para10"></a>I have dealt already with the question of the rates being low. The rates being paid to clerks are the same as those paid by the Legal Service Commission to clerks for attending as solicitors at interviews.
<P>

<a name="40427-19_para11"></a>Choices have to be made. The Government have chosen to go for excellence and proper representation at a time when that representation makes a difference. I understand the concerns, but I urge noble Lords to think very carefully about all the other measures that we have put in place to improve the situation.

<P>

<a name="40427-19_para12"></a>She held out an attempted solace that persons raped or tortured may have a mental incapacity so they will be all right.

<A NAME="40427-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what is the impact of housing benefit regulations on those aged over 19 who are seeking to study full-time for below degree-level qualifications.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am glad to have this opportunity to draw the attention of the House to the impact of housing benefit regulations on <P>


<a name="column_758"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 758</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the ability of vulnerable young people in housing need to achieve qualifications below degree level. In doing so, I declare an interest as vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Foyer Federation, which has asked me to raise this issue in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para9"></a>Many young people whose lives have been disrupted by homelessness may not return to education until they are over 19. Having been out of the traditional education system for many years, they may need to retake GCSEs before perhaps studying for an NVQ or an A-level. The current 16-hour housing benefit rule means that those aged 19 and over are unable to study for more than 16 hours a week without losing their housing benefit. That means that potentially thousands of young people are unable to gain the skills that would lift them out of a lifetime of poverty.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para10"></a>I should explain a little more about the implications of the 16-hour rule on housing benefit. The rule forbids those claiming housing benefit who have started a course of study after their 19th birthday from studying for more than 16 hours of guided learning each week even if they are not claiming any other benefits. This applies to all levels of learner from the basic English-as-a-second-language course to degree level study. The only people permitted to study for more than 16 hours a week while claiming housing benefit are parents or people with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para11"></a>We accept that for those seeking to study at degree level or level four NVQ it is reasonable that they should not be able to claim housing benefit. University students have access to a system of income support which is intended to allow them to cover their rents without recourse to housing benefit. But this system of support does not apply to those studying at level three or below. With the business community crying out for a highly-skilled labour force at all levels, it cannot be right that young people are denied the opportunity to better their skills and benefit themselves and society from the process.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para12"></a>It is important to welcome the Government's publication among the Budget documents last month, Supporting young people to achieve: towards a new deal for skills. The document sets out proposals aimed at ensuring that all young people reach the age of 19 equipped for higher education or skilled employment. It also outlines possible criteria for 19 year-olds to access extended support to finish a course of learning.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para13"></a>A recent survey by the Foyer Federation&#151;the UK's leading youth organisation providing the largest network of accommodation integrated with education and training opportunities for 16 to 25 year-olds in housing need&#151; indicates that this proposed relaxation of restrictions on full-time study for those who are already on an agreed and appropriate course of study when they turn 19 would help about half of the Foyer residents who cannot currently achieve the qualifications that they want. But the other half of the Foyer's residents, those aged over 19, gain very little from the new proposals.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para14"></a>The Foyer Federation very much welcomes the Government's new proposals, but a recent survey highlights the fact that they will still leave many Foyer <P>


<a name="column_759"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 759</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>residents each year, and thousands of young people outside Foyer's, in a situation in which they cannot claim benefit and are unable to gain the skills that they need. Many of these homeless young people may not have the confidence or the stability in their lives to consider returning to education until they are 19, or sometimes into their early twenties. For these young people it is indeed a cruel blow. Having worked hard to achieve their GCSEs&#151;often having failed them first time round because they had spent much of their final year of secondary school on a friend's sofa as a result of family breakdown or similar circumstances&#151;they find that they are now over 19 and cannot get support to move on to full-time study for their A-levels.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para15"></a>One striking example of how the benefit rules have prevented an able young person from fulfilling their potential is of a Foyer resident who wanted to study his A-levels with the goal of going to university to study history. However, he was 24 and he was not eligible to claim housing benefit while studying full time. Instead, he found a job in a call centre after living on jobseeker's allowance for four months. Instead of gaining his A-levels and perhaps securing a place at university, he is now working at a call centre. The rules should really not allow for such wasted potential.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para16"></a>Young homeless people need more money to live on because they have to pay rent and do not receive the financial or non-financial subsidy that most parents provide to children living at home. They have less time to earn because they are managing their own households, doing their own shopping and cooking and, in many cases, grappling with the benefit system. Those young people face particular problems with housing benefit. First, it is not paid to people over the age of 18, studying full time, which is defined as 16 hours or less. That often means that in practice for many homeless young people there are only two options. One is to study full time and to earn enough to cover their rent and costs, which may approach 150 a week, making it almost impossible to combine both activities. The alternative is to drop down to a part-time course, often losing a year because of the need to start again, part-time in a new college year. By taking twice as long to achieve their qualifications, they fall further and further behind their contemporaries. The Foyer Federation's research shows that the majority of Foyer residents struggling to stay in full-time education take neither of those options. Instead, like the example that I quoted, they drop out of study completely and revert to jobseeker's allowance or to some work such as call centre work.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para17"></a>Last year we on these Benches welcomed the introduction by the Government of the pilot adult learning grant. Today I welcome the Government's commitment to consider rolling that scheme out nationally following the evaluation of the 10 pilot areas. However, it is important to draw attention to the inherent contradiction in the rules for the adult learning grant, which has an effect on the idea of improving the skills of young people. The grant offers an allowance of up to 30 a week to young adults on low income studying full time for a first full level 2 <P>


<a name="column_760"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 760</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>qualification or for young adults studying full time for a first level 3 qualification. What good news for young people&#151;except for those who also need to claim housing benefit, as the housing benefit rules prevent them from studying full time.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para18"></a>That contradiction will become more intense if the Government accept the proposal of the Tomlinson working group on 14 to 19 reform, since it envisages that the diploma will require full-time study of at least 20 hours a week. I therefore urge the Government urgently to consider undertaking a fundamental review of the 16-hour housing benefit rule. The rule discriminates against people seeking to increase their earning potential, either by discouraging them from studying for qualifications altogether or by forcing them to take the slower part-time route. The federation has calculated that it costs the Exchequer in the region of 100 million a year in tax and national insurance revenue forgone on higher earnings, which some people could have achieved with those qualifications. Elimination of those rules would be good for the economy and would give many young adults a secure foothold in skilled employment and thus minimise the risk that they will slide back into homelessness, with all the social costs that that implies.

<A NAME="40427-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has identified and explained the problem well. However, in my recent reading, I came across a DWP press release, which said with a certain amount of dismay that fraud and error in housing benefit is now believed to be between 550 and 750 million. That is more than half a billion pounds&#151;a huge amount of money. No wonder I have heard it described as the worst managed benefit that there is. What efforts are the Government making to combat that, and would not quite a small amount of that money be appropriate for those over 19 as full-time students?
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para19"></a>Since I last dealt with housing benefit, which was some 15 years ago, a lot of water has passed under the housing benefit bridge&#151;if I may be allowed to mix my metaphors. There has been the contracting out by local authorities, which became such a shambles with late and inaccurate payments that my own local authority of Taunton Deane, and I am sure most others, have repatriated the payment scheme. None the less, I am told that there are parts of the country even now where it is routine to wait six months for a first payments. That is why one sees advertisements for rooms and flats stating "No DSS"&#151;or, very occasionally, because the property market is a little slow in catching up with the changes in government departments, the advertisement may say "No DWP claimants".
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para20"></a>I accept that today's debate is not really about the problems of people of whatever age who are on benefit. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, explained, it is about a particular group who are not able to claim housing benefit. She has highlighted the problem of those over 19 who seek to study full time for level 2 or 3 qualifications or vocational courses and are, as a result, living away from home. The problem might equally apply to 16 to 19 year-olds at sixth form <P>


<a name="column_761"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 761</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>colleges and the like, as well as vocational courses such as I attended many years ago. However, at whatever age, the rules are complex in the extreme, and most students are excluded from housing benefit altogether, because in general they are deemed to be not liable to make payments in respect of a dwelling.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para21"></a>Clearly, those young people identified by the noble Baroness do not fit into the standard category of rules for housing benefit&#151;the assumption is clearly untrue. The students have left home and have to live somewhere. The only rent-free accommodation that I can think of is the house of a family or friend, a squat or a pavement&#151;the latter two of which are totally undesirable. So the great mass of students in full-time post-school education living away from home are in need of rented accommodation. Some of those students will be liable for housing benefit. I am grateful to the Erewash Borough Council for a very useful web page on this subject. Normally full-time students are ineligible for income support, for example, but a few will be. Some lone parents and student couples with dependent children may also fall into that category, as will disabled students. As far as I can gather, that is it.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para22"></a>It is true that City and Guilds is offering a small number of grants each year to those people studying for a City and Guilds examination, but the range of purposes for which the grants are paid does not include housing costs. A career development loan from the DfES might be appropriate, covering as it does funding for up to two years of learning and up to one year's practical work experience subsequently, when it forms part of the course. The loans are between 300 and 8,000, but interest is payable from as little as one month after the course is completed. That is hardly comparable with students coming out of university. Why is that unfairness built into the system?
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para23"></a>Very few of the sub-degree course students will be eligible for any of those support schemes, whether housing benefit, income support, City and Guilds or career development loans. How, then, do the Government expect the great mass of the students covered by this debate to exist&#151;on thin air? Indeed, what information does the department have on how many students we are talking about and how they exist? Part-time jobs are all very well, but I agree with the noble Baroness that they are hardly conducive to study. She has highlighted a very real problem. How do the Government intend to solve it?

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para24"></a>To an extent, the noble Baroness answered many of the questions she raised in the debate, not least by giving us a very clear account of the relationship between housing benefit and full-time and part-time student rights. As both noble Lords know, there is a historic relationship&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has already used these words&#151;between educational support and the benefits system, which goes far back&#151;I hesitate to say to the origins of the welfare state&#151;and has long-standing issues. Because the Foyer Federation supports young homeless people this is its great charge, particularly in relation to further education, training and employment.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para25"></a>The debate has also raised a series of questions about why young people find themselves in this position in the first place, why they drop out of education and what we can do to prevent that.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para26"></a>If I may be allowed, I shall take a step back and look in a bit more detail at what we are trying to do to prevent young people becoming homeless in the first place and to engage them and sustain them in education. I want to acknowledge what my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Andrew Smith, acknowledged when he met the new parliamentary Foyer group. He recalled the fantastic work of the Foyer Federation. I think that we all want to congratulate it on the work it does on behalf of young and homeless people.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para27"></a>If we look at some of the root causes of the predicament, if we take the 10,000 young people who Foyer looks after and for whom it provides accommodation, Foyer and noble Lords will credit the Government for our intentions in relation to raising skills overall. We want to encourage and enable all forms of learning. Learning is no longer something that takes place in schools between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. One of the interesting points that I came across in preparing for the debate is that the "Success for All" initiative in further education means that colleges are able to develop more flexible arrangements to enable them to deliver learning at times that are most convenient to learners, many of whom are in employment.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para28"></a>When we look at the historic differences between the sectors of FE and HE, the flexibility is one of the key joys. It means that an individual can choose to learn at the best time, whether in terms of age or of time of day or week. Colleges are also paying increasing attention to providing the personal support that students need if they are to complete their qualifications successfully. We want to encourage as many different, flexible and complementary routes into education and training as possible. FE is the great highway for that. But our great ambition is to move towards a better and more coherent balance of support and learning, not only for the 16 to 19 age group, but also for adult learners over 19.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para29"></a>This has been the Holy Grail for many governments in the past: to try to make more sense of a necessarily complex and flexible area of provision. We must start with raising the numbers staying on in full-time education. We acknowledge the scale of the challenge, as does Foyer. In its documents, it has drawn attention <P>


<a name="column_763"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 763</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the 16-hour rule and to the traditionally low staying-on rates in school. We must start there. That is the challenge. We want to make our staying-on rate at 16 among the highest in the OECD so that people reach the age of 19 with the skills that they need to succeed. Those goals are central to what we want to see for a better future. We must create the conditions and provide the support that, in the first instance, enables young people to stay on in full-time education. That means clear expectations, a clear route, a better learning offer and support and incentives.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para30"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will forgive me if I say that if we want to keep young people out of the homeless condition in which many find themselves, one of the most effective things that we can do is to improve the provision that we make for children in care, who later make up so much of the homeless population. I am delighted that, in the Children Bill, we have the opportunity to put a duty to promote educational effectiveness and to improve educational standards on the statute book for the first time. We mean it when we say that every child matters. This has a direct bearing on the work of Foyer.
<P>

<a name="40427-20_para31"></a>The next step is to engage 14 to 19 year-olds in learning with a wider choice of vocational options. The noble Baroness referred to the Tomlinson report and I hold out a great hope that, by pushing that in all seriousness, we will overcome some of the fundamental, historic reasons why so many young people have not found the academic curriculum to their liking or a success. Following that, we must provide financial support. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, spoke passionately about the situation of 16 to 19 year-olds. I presume from that that he welcomes the educational maintenance allowance system, which has been in gestation for many years and has probably been tested more widely than any other education initiative that we have tried. By its success, it has already demonstrated how important financial incentives are.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. Does the educational maintenance allowance cover housing costs? I know that it covers living costs but housing costs are the point at issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   No, my Lords, not directly. It is a benefit that goes to support young people and to enable them to stay in school. Most of those young people will be living in their parents' homes. Nevertheless, we believe that it will make a fundamental difference to the 400,000 young people who will get EMAs by 2006. It will make a fundamental difference to many of them. Some of them may be able to use some of that money to support their living costs at home.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-21_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that, for those who are under 19, if they are homeless and in a Foyer, they are eligible for housing benefit? The problem arises with those who are over 19 and who are not already engaged in a <P>


<a name="column_764"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 764</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>course of study. They are totally ineligible. While I am on my feet, I shall add that the key issue is that, with all the best will in the world, there will be some cases where young people part from their parents, perhaps through parental break-up or unhappiness at being at home, and find themselves on the street and out of education. For all that schools are trying to do to keep them, there is no way in which they can. It is vitally important to find some way of enabling such young people to retrace their steps and pick themselves up again. This is the key issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I would not dispute anything that the noble Baroness said. Indeed, I would not take issue with what Foyer has done in demonstrating its case. I think that the virtue of the EMA is that it offers an opportunity for young people to stay on in education and, perhaps, to draw back from the decision to leave, or even to give their parents some encouragement for them to stay on. That is such an essential link. At the moment, we have a cross-departmental review of financial support for 16 to 19 year-olds in which we are looking at the case for radical reform in the longer term. Over the next few years we shall see that come to fruition.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para0"></a>This debate is about the relationship between education and benefit support, in relation to housing benefit. There will be no surprises here. It has long been a logical principle that the education system and not the social security system should support full-time students&#151;whether they are in FE or HE&#151;and that income-related benefits should be provided for those in work and those unable to work. It has also long been a sensible principle that those who wish to study part-time can do so, while receiving some help through the social security system. In terms of housing benefit, our memories are quite long and if we look back to before 1990 we had the unsatisfactory position where housing benefit was available for students only during the long vacation. We can all remember the anomalous and confusing situations that that gave rise to and a cross-party consensus grew that we should address that situation and come up with something consistent and rational so that everybody would know where they were.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para1"></a>So in line with that general principle, since 1990 social security regulations have not allowed full-time students to claim unemployment-related benefit, income support or housing benefit. As the noble Baroness said, the DWP regulations define full-time learning as more than 16 hours per week. Also, the Secretary of State himself said in that briefing that the aim of that rule was to encourage individuals to work to earn enough not to need benefit while studying part-time. We continue to feel that that rule serves an important purpose. It allows a useful flexibility; it allows a range of choices.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para2"></a>To that extent, I cannot give the noble Baroness the satisfaction that she seeks on that issue. The noble Lord has identified some of the groups&#151;full-time students, disabled people, couples with dependent <P>


<a name="column_765"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 765</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>children&#151;who are in those categories of people who can claim. It is important that they should be able to do so.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para3"></a>However, I would not want the noble Baroness or the noble Lord to leave the debate thinking that we are in any sense complacent about the matter. We are conscious that young people trying to grasp what may be a second chance by investing in those fundamental qualifications deserve encouragement and support. The diversity of further education is a considerable source of strength in many ways.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para4"></a>I can give the noble Baroness and the noble Lord some figures&#151;although not all of them, I fear. There are about 3.9 million learners in further education; 3.5 million of them are taking courses that lead to qualifications. I shall go back to the department to see whether I can obtain figures on the lines that the noble Lord seeks. I know that it is a rather murky area statistically, but I shall see what I can come up with.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para5"></a>Again, we are definitely not complacent and recognise that the 16-hour rule, whereby income-related benefits should be provided only for those in work or unable to work, can and is creating difficulties for some people wanting to study for more than those hours. The situation is being monitored by the DWP. That is exactly why the DWP and the DfES are working together in the context of the New Deal for Skills to streamline and improve the arrangements to support those in learning. So the situation is very much in our minds.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para6"></a>However, in the mean time, we are doing what we can in other ways to raise the income of people&#151;very vulnerable people&#151;whom we want to keep in education. To support homeless students who are in FE, we have increased the extra funds, the disadvantage uplift, which goes to colleges for such students, from 12 to 14 per cent. So we are putting resources directly into colleges to enable them to provide extra for those young people.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para7"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned the overall skills strategy. Yes, we placed a clear emphasis in our paper in July last year on ensuring that training is available. Employers have an increasingly important role to play in the skills strategy but the New Deal for Skills also specifically aims to ensure that those who start training when they are out of work can continue when they are in a job. There is a very important link to be made.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para8"></a>In addition, I understand that employer training pilots are now running that encourage employers to invest in skills and qualifications, especially for low-skilled trainees. About 48,000 are in that category. The important point is that people need to know about it. A huge element, which I am sure that Foyer has picked up on, is that what is important is not financial support for learning but the right advice and direction&#151;correct information about the options; how people go about accessing them; and so on.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para9"></a>A new statement of basic service standards for advice and guidance was published before Christmas and the Learning and Skills Council will in future <P>


<a name="column_766"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 766</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contract such partnerships on a more rigorous basis to secure delivery of those standards. We want through the New Deal for Skills to reconfigure the service and re-contract against much higher service standards. That will mean better information and advice, strengthening the links between the agencies. That is very important for those young people, who need to know what are their choices.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para10"></a>The third aspect of the strategy&#151;again, already referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp&#151;is about supporting people directly and financially. The Adult Learning Grant has been successful. The pilots have shown improved retention. It was piloted in nine areas of deprivation and low skills for those with low salaries and aiming for levels two and three. That means that for the first time, there will be help for five good GCSEs and two good A-levels or their equivalent. Throughout this year, there is a significant roll-out in the south-east and north-east. That is interesting and it is important that we monitor what goes on.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para11"></a>The extension of the grant&#151;I know that Foyer welcomes this&#151;requires attendance of only 12 to 13 hours a week. That should enable increasing numbers of Foyer residents and others with low skills to get the building block qualifications to move into work. I also understand that the Foyer Federation is in discussion with DfES officials about ways to help more Foyer residents access that grant. The noble Baroness will probably also know about the 95 million that is going into the Learner Support Fund. That has been available since 1999. It is for basic things: travel, books, equipment and childcare. Significantly, that has a high take-up; we are seeing the benefit of those funds available in colleges on a discretionary basis.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para12"></a>I should also mention the basic skills strategy, which is addressing the problems of 7 million adult illiterates&#151;so many of them connected with the problems that create homelessness. That is the end strategy for those adults.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para13"></a>Before concluding, I shall address the point about housing benefit. Tempting though it is to follow the noble Lord down that road, I shall not, except to say that we have made some progress since the housing benefit reform programme was launched in October 2002. The publication of the benefit performance standards for housing benefit and council tax was supported by a 200 million fund over three years to help to meet new standards. The average time taken to process claims has improved by 5 per cent since 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para14"></a>On fraud, we are the first Government systematically to measure loss in the housing benefit system. We have set a challenging target to reduce fraud by 25 per cent by 2006, so no one can accuse us of not at least measuring the size of the problem and trying to do something about it. We are also taking steps such as the verification framework to ensure that benefits are paid to the right person at the right time&#151;which is extremely important. So we are well aware of the challenge of housing benefit and the importance of simplification.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-21_para15"></a>Let me conclude by simply reiterating our unequivocal commitment to the enabling of young people, especially those who have had an uncertain and often unhappy start in life, to equip themselves with the skills that they need. It is essential to our social and economic ambitions. Skilled workers can master change; they can seize the opportunities on offer and defend themselves against poverty and poor health, and can have wider choices and safer lives. I recognise with great sympathy and personal interest many of the points made by noble Lords this evening. We have taken and are continuing to take steps towards building a more coherent and sensible system in which young people can thrive and which helps through the <P>


<a name="column_768"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 768</B></P>

<P>

<a name="40427-21_para16"></a>In case I have not replied to points of detail in the time available, I shall be sure to scrutinise Hansard and make sure that noble Lords get fuller answers if necessary. I am very grateful to the noble Baroness.

<H4><center>The Committee met at half past three of the clock.</center></H4>
[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Geddes) in the Chair.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-22_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Geddes): </B>  Before calling Amendment No. 68, I should advise Members of the Committee that should Divisions be called in the Chamber, this meeting of the Grand Committee will be adjourned for approximately 10 minutes.
<P>

<a name="40427-22_para1"></a>Clause 17 [Arrangements for network management]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-22_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 68:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 7, line 38, after "make" insert "and publish"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-22_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40427-22_para3"></a>The noble Viscount said: Amendment No. 68 inserts a duty on a local transport authority to publish such arrangements as it considers appropriate for planning and carrying out the action to be taken in performing its network management duty as set out in Clause 16. We are asking that it should publish its objectives and policies as it seems to me that that would help accountability. It would help local residents, utility companies and other road users, and it might even help the local Member of Parliament to see what the local transport authority plans to do and how it attempts to achieve it. The Minister may say that most local authorities do publish such information. However, it seems that there is no duty for them to do so.
<P>

<a name="40427-22_para4"></a>Part 2 of the Bill concerns network management duty. As we saw earlier, there are substantial intervention powers. Therefore, the clearer the duties are laid out, the easier it will be for everyone to have a view on what local authorities are achieving and whether they wish to press for intervention. The amendment seeks to draw out the Government's thinking on this issue and to see whether it is necessary to include it in the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Before I say anything, perhaps I may explain why I am here rather than my noble friend Lord Davies. Yesterday, he took his dog for a walk but chose to ride a bicycle while doing so. The dog was distracted and my noble friend fell off and hurt his neck. He came in yesterday in great pain and was expertly administered to by the noble Lord, Lord McColl of Dulwich, who, for a little while, had his hands round the neck of a Government Minister. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, was terrific. I should like publicly to thank him and I hope, I expect on behalf of everyone in the room, that Bryan gets better soon. There have been a number of jokes about <P>


<a name="column_60"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a Minister taking a traffic management Bill through Parliament and falling off his bicycle, but we shall leave that.
<P>

<a name="40427-22_para5"></a>Amendment No. 68 would require a local traffic authority not only to make arrangements to perform its network management duty but to publish the arrangements. That, we feel, would be an unnecessary additional burden on authorities at a time when the Government are reducing their demands on authorities to produce plans of various sorts and becoming less bureaucratic. Much of the information will be in the public domain; for example, an authority's transport policies and where the traffic management sits in the organisation. More importantly, the assessment of authorities against the criteria will be in terms of their performance of the duty and not on what they have written down.
<P>

<a name="40427-22_para6"></a>If authorities find it helpful to publish information about the arrangements they have made either in hard copy or electronically, they are free to do so. But we do not consider it appropriate to make it a requirement on the face of the Bill. Therefore, I ask the noble Viscount to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-22_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   For the Minister to say that it would be burdensome and bureaucratic is extraordinary, because the Bill puts a huge amount of burden and bureaucracy on to local authorities. We are always trying to make the Bill less bureaucratic and burdensome.
<P>

<a name="40427-22_para7"></a>The Minister said that it was a question of the performance of their duty, not what they have written down. How do we know whether they have performed their duty adequately if it has not been written down and published? How will it be assessed? I remain somewhat unconvinced by the Minister's answer. These provisions will impose duties on local authorities and if they do not succeed in those duties, major changes will take place, as we will see later in the Bill. We are saying that we will see if local authorities are performing adequately without ensuring that they have published what they intend to do so that we can judge whether they are indeed performing adequately. The judgment should be made not just by the department but within the local authority so it can see what it is doing. I find the Minister's answer somewhat unconvincing and will wish to return to this on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   If I may intervene, I am told that the criteria for performance are covered in later clauses&#151;Clause 18 for guidance on the duty and Clause 27 for guidance on criteria. Perhaps we will come back to discuss this subject later.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-22_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful remarks. We may indeed have to do that. However, it is important that it is clear to all local authorities what their duties are in regard to local traffic planning. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   Before the noble Viscount sits down, I thought the Minister's reply was somewhat at fault. I believe that under the beacon status system <P>


<a name="column_61"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 61</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which has now been approved, certain councils have in fact been relieved of duties to prepare local transport plans. If they do not prepare a local transport plan and they do not publish the criteria by which they are managing the highways, all the utilities which depend upon them and their own highway department&#151;which presumably will also be seeking leave to dig up the road&#151;will not have, in published form, any sort of real-time, electronic or written-down system to which they can refer. If I am right, I will wish to join the noble Viscount in raising this again on Report. It should be axiomatic that a local authority somewhere publishes the plans for the local highway.
<P>

<a name="40427-22_para8"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-22_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 69:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 8, line 4, leave out "(but need not)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-22_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40427-22_para10"></a>The noble Viscount said: Amendment No. 69 relates to Clause 17(3), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The traffic manager may (but need not) be an employee of the authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-22_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40427-22_para12"></a>When the Minister kindly organised a meeting with his officials and I put the question to them, the answer was that the traffic manager might not be an employee because this could be contracted out. I thought further about that, and if that is the case, it needs to be made clearer in the Bill. In what circumstances would a local authority contract out the duty of the traffic manager? We need a little more information. If a traffic manager is an employee of the authority, then there is a clear line of accountability and all the other people in the local authority are aware of that. But are we talking about contracting out the duty to a local firm or a national body? It seems to me that it is a rather dangerous provision.
<P>

<a name="40427-22_para13"></a>Of course, I realise that many services within councils are contracted out. However, the traffic manager has not only a managing role but a policy-making role. Therefore, we are saying that the local authority could contract out the policy-making role to a third party. That is what concerns me and&#151;this is a probing amendment&#151;I should be grateful if the Minister could explain under what circumstances he believes that that could happen. Does he agree that there is a policy-making aspect to this issue? If that was the case, we would have some concerns. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I hope that I shall be able to reassure the noble Viscount. Behind this clause is flexibility for the local authority. We have deliberately not specified how the role of traffic manager should be performed, who he should be and where he might fit into the organisation. Local authorities are free to make such decisions for themselves. Even if they contracted out the job, the duty would still rest with the authority.
<P>

<a name="40427-22_para14"></a>Clause 17(3) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The traffic manager may (but need not) be an employee of the authority",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-22_para15"></a>
as we have heard. That provides for the traffic manager to be an external organisation or individual if the authority considers it the most appropriate way <P>


<a name="column_62"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to meet the network management duty. By deleting the phrase in brackets, Amendment No. 69 would leave an element of uncertainty about who else could be a traffic manager, and that would be unsatisfactory. We want authorities to be able to choose what is best for them without there being any doubt. I repeat that the intention behind the clause is that local authorities should be given flexibility, and I hope that the noble Viscount will withdraw the amendment. Of course, policy will remain with the local authority and not with the traffic manager, however appointed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-22_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   Before the noble Viscount intervenes again, it seems to me that this matter goes to the very heart of the Bill. In appointing the traffic manager, the local authority appoints someone whose job it is to share out the use of the highway between a number of conflicting parties. Such a job is not easy to give to a contractor. For example, Halcrow may be employed in that role, but it is not employed to exercise policy decisions on the part of the local authority. If one goes down the road of putting policy out to contractors, one ends up in the position of the railways, which is absolutely impossible for anyone.
<P>

<a name="40427-22_para16"></a>There must be someone right at the middle who will take all the conflicting demands, involving the interruption of traffic and the use of road space, and act as a policy judge between them. The decisions that he makes in favour of one will obviously be to the detriment of another. Therefore, I ask the Minister to think very carefully about this matter so that he does not give to contractors the job of making policy within the council.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Tordoff: </B>   I am something of a spare part in this Grand Committee. I am here only because I was very involved in the New Roads and Street Works Bill, several centuries ago, when Lord Underhill, the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, and I filled the time of the whole Chamber day after day. That is why I consider this to be a suitable Bill for Grand Committee. What went wrong with that Bill&#151;we thought that we had cracked it but we obviously failed&#151;was that, ultimately, the people who should have picked up responsibility for doing something about road usage and holes in the road failed to do so. I think my noble friend is perfectly right in saying what he has just said. There needs to be someone with responsibility for making sure that these matters are dealt with. It is not clear from the Bill as I read it that that is the case at the moment.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para0"></a>I do not intend to interfere much more on this Bill. I shall leave it to my noble friend and to my noble kinswoman. I have been trying to get that in for some time! There is a general point here. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Peyton of Yeovil, who is an expert on holes in the road, will agree that the Bill that we passed all those years ago failed because the authorities who ought to have held the balance between the conflicting interests failed to do so. I remember we had long discussions with NJUG, the AA and the RAC. We really thought at that stage that we had the balance about right. But, so far as I can see, the provisions of that Bill were largely ignored when it <P>


<a name="column_63"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>came to looking after the use of the road, people digging holes in it and so on. However, good things came out of it. The standard as regards the filling up of holes went up quite a bit as a result of that Bill. However, I caution the Committee that we must be very precise within this Bill to make sure that we are putting the responsibility where it belongs and that we make those responsible report to their local authorities and to their local citizens.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   I am glad to follow my noble friend Lord Tordoff&#151;my noble kinsman, indeed, we think. For some weeks I have tried to get to grips with what it is I do not like about this Bill and what it is that is leaving me profoundly uncomfortable. There are certain specific points which I can identify, but this debate has encapsulated where the problem lies. This is a Bill that in its conception and in its public face is about the problem of street works&#151;it is about holes in the road, utilities and so on. That is an issue which I think we would all agree needs to be addressed. The problem is that the Bill as it is worded goes very, very much further. It refers to the kind of issues to which my noble friend Lord Bradshaw referred which concern allocation of road space and some of the sustainable transport measures that are being brought in. The kind of issue that we are discussing goes very much further than was originally envisaged in this Bill. It is now potentially leading to what looks like a change of local transport policy which is so significant that local authorities may well have to tear up much of the work that they have done in the past five years.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para1"></a>I am sorry to speak in such vague terms on a specific amendment but this issue will be a thread that will run through our proceedings on this Bill. There is a fundamental dysfunctionality between the words as printed and the original intention of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   It appears to me that this Bill as it is now allows the possibility that someone will be appointed who is not an employee of the local authority to exercise a great deal of discretion in matters where there are some very big commercial interests involved. A three-month delay on a bit of planning so that the road is not dug up again would be a very serious matter. A number of my forebears held such posts, and very lucrative they were too. Where we are dealing with that kind of discretion in the modern world, we should keep it under the umbrella of the local authority.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I should like to say two things. I must stress that all we are doing in this clause is giving flexibility to local authorities. We are doing nothing more sinister than that. No one will force local authorities to contract out. It may be possible to set guidelines or rules for a contracted-out traffic manager while keeping policy in-house. All we are doing is allowing that option. It is very difficult to understand why the noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, is so upset about this amendment <P>


<a name="column_64"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the Government's reaction to it. It seems to me to be totally clear: we are giving local authorities flexibilities. Do they not want that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-23_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The arrangements must include provision for ensuring that the authority . . .  determine specific policies or objectives in relation to different roads or classes of road in their road network".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-23_para2"></a>
Determining specific policies or objectives for different roads is far removed from the question of managing whether telecoms dig up the road one week and the gas people the next. This is very much about traffic management. That is why local authorities are so concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-23_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My modest amendment seems to have sparked off an interesting debate. I was again somewhat surprised by the Minister's argument as I thought that he took my argument to justify his position. He said that I was creating uncertainty. In fact I narrowed down the issue: I am creating certainty. I am saying that by taking out the relevant words, he has to be an employee of the authority, he cannot be contracted out, which is a way of stimulating debate on how this might happen.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para3"></a>We must go away, think about this area and scratch our heads to see whether we have got the matter wrong and the Government have got it right, or vice versa. That is what we shall do. We may even come and talk to the Minister before Report. I am grateful for his response. It certainly shed light on the issue. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Borrie </B>   moved Amendment No. 70:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 8, line 11, at end insert ", having regard to the importance of street works relating to essential services such as gas, electricity, water and telecommunications and, in particular, the need to ensure the safety and security of supply of those services; and
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-23_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
( ) in implementing the arrangements does not discriminate in its application between its own works and street works;"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-23_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment stands in my name and that of the noble Earl, Lord Erroll. It has two purposes. The first is specifically to put in the Bill the need to balance the maintenance of essential services, which often require the roads to be dug up, against the need to reduce congestion and disruption of our roads. The other is to achieve equity between utilities and private companies on the one hand and local authorities&#151;who themselves sometimes dig up the roads&#151;on the other.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para7"></a>On the first purpose, as I suggested at Second Reading, the very obvious public interest&#151;which is clearly addressed in the Bill&#151;in reducing obstruction in our streets needs to be balanced against the public interest regarding the safety and efficiency of our gas and water mains and so on. Security and sustainability of supply are most important to the general public and, indeed, to the ongoing work of commercial enterprises of all kinds. Clearly, a collapse in the supply of gas, water, electricity or telecoms can be catastrophic for commercial enterprises in particular.

<a name="40427-23_para8"></a>The Government are pushing BT and other telecom suppliers to roll-out broadband. My noble friend Lord Erroll referred to that at the close of the previous Committee sitting. One must bear in mind that although some temporary disruption of traffic is involved when holes are dug in the highway, the greater the success of broadband roll-out in the years to come, the more likely it is that businesses will be able to locate staff at home, thereby reducing the need for staff to commute to work&#151;which is one of the biggest causes of congestion on our roads at certain times of the day. Clause 17(4)(b) as drafted refers to the authority taking "any possible action" to deal with the causes of congestion. That is a very wide provision. It would be helpful to have it balanced in the way I have suggested.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para9"></a>As I indicated, the second purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, in seeking to implement its arrangements for network management, the local authority takes the same approach to highway authority and local authority works&#151;skips, scaffolding&#151;as it does to works and obstructions caused by the utilities. As I understand it, local authorities and utilities are each responsible for roughly equal numbers of road and street works and should, as far as possible, be subject to the same terms and conditions.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para10"></a>It seems to be the Bill's intent that only utilities, but not local authorities, would be charged for permits to undertake road and street works. Only utilities would be subject to fines for offences. Local authorities would be subject instead to a points system. Why is there to be such discrimination if the Government are serious about tackling congestion caused by whomever? After all, local authorities are responsible, as I have suggested, for roughly half of the works on the road. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   I should like briefly to speak, but before I do so, might I enlist the Deputy Chairman's help in reminding noble Lords that audibility has never been a feature of this Room? Although I grant that it has been improved recently, it is still quite difficult to hear. If the Deputy Chairman were to persuade those who are speaking to enter into a more intimate relationship with the microphone, it would help those who are of an increasing age and do not hear every word.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para11"></a>However, although I am speaking immediately after the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, I heard every word that he said. While I admire the clarity of his voice, I hope that Members of the Committee will decline the amendment in due course if it is ever seriously moved.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para12"></a>The utilities have enjoyed great privileges. They have received covert support from local authorities, which felt it was not in their interests to quarrel or be nasty to utilities. Anybody who enjoys great privileges tends to abuse them and to cease to be grateful for them. I have had frequent occasion in the not too distant past to refer in the Chamber to the number of quite unacceptable delays caused by utilities, which seem to take prolonged holidays while they just dig the place up. It is often a long interval before they finish <P>


<a name="column_66"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their digging. The conviction that I have that roads and highways are designed for movement is too often flouted.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para13"></a>I shall not speak at greater length, but it would be very dangerous to allow the utilities to continue to abuse their privileges as they have in the past. Highway authorities have been greatly to blame for folding their arms and doing little to encourage speed or efficiency on the part of the utilities. I hope that the amendment will be rejected in due course.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-23_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   I put my name to the amendment because it also refers to telecommunications. The real problem is that it is as essential for companies these days not to lose their connection to the information superhighway, as it is sometimes called, as it is for new connections to be established at short notice. The Government also need such connections in order to communicate with companies. Many matters are dealt with electronically, and that will be increasingly true in the future. E-procurement&#151;electronic procurement&#151;systems are in place and will soon be the only way of dealing with local authorities and government, however small a trader one is. If one does not have access to that, one will go out of business.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para14"></a>The matter on which I have been lobbied is that the Bill as drafted could give rise to unfair situations due to the different treatment of the Highways Agency and some of the utilities. The special position of telecommunications people is due to the fact that most of the trunk infrastructure, which causes the disruption, has already been laid. The major digging up has already been done. It is therefore essential to ensure that there is at least a level playing field&#151;as people like to call it&#151;and that the Bill provides for such work to be carried out efficiently.
<P>

<a name="40427-23_para15"></a>The amendment would remove one of the potential inequalities regarding the Highways Agency, which might become bogged down in bureaucracy regarding the demands of the utilities. It is a question of ensuring fair treatment between public authority works and private operators which are probably trying to do a job that is also essential for the public authorities.

<A NAME="40427-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I find myself in sympathy with my noble friend and with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. I hope to hear from the Minister how this balancing act will be achieved. If the answer when my broadband connection goes down because of a break in the cable is that I cannot have it back for three months because the road has just been resurfaced, I shall not be pleased, and I shall be contending with my noble friend in favour of the amendment. If on the other hand I am told that that sort of consideration will be treated in much the same way as a gas leak or a cut in the water supply, then I am going to be feeling reasonably content about it.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para0"></a>I wish to understand better the last part of the amendment where local authority works are brought into the scheme. It seems odd to promote a scheme that covers only half of the works that happen in a road. If <P>


<a name="column_67"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we are to co-ordinate street works, let us co-ordinate those of the local authority as well as what is happening with the utilities and others.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para1"></a>My own amendment is merely to give the Government a chance to elucidate what they mean by the word "insignificant". The last serious traffic jam that I was caught up in was caused by a flasher. I do not know whether that would count as "insignificant".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I shall try to speak up. We have one or two concerns with the Bill. We agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that the works of the highway authority should be ranked alongside those of the utilities, so that both parties would contribute to the overall plan being considered by the traffic manager.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para2"></a>I would take the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, to task to some extent in that, in my quite considerable experience, utilities frequently use the word "emergency" to designate the work they are carrying out, thereby getting round any plan. They often dig up the road and find that they do not have in stock the part that they need&#151;the valve, the tube or the switch or whatever. That might be because the utilities have taken to employing ever more subcontractors at ever lower levels. They do not have stocks of available parts and the road is often left open, as the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, said. A hole is dug in the road and then someone goes to look for the part&#151;and the opening remains there for days.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para3"></a>So we look for equity of treatment between the highway authority's own works and those of the utilities. However, we also look for the utilities to act responsibly, not say that there is an emergency when there is not one and carry proper stocks so that, if emergencies arise, they can usually effect repairs reasonably promptly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I support Amendment No. 70 but I have a few questions about it. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, that many utilities call street works "emergencies" when they may not be. On the other hand, if the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, did not have his broadband, then in his view it would be an emergency.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para4"></a>Although it is right that the utilities and the local authorities should be assessed equally on the amount of road congestion they cause, I am not quite sure how that can be done. Will a value for money assessment be made of lane closures and the consequent five-minute traffic jam caused for cars and lorries? Will the assessment apply to cyclists and pedestrians who never suffer such delay because they can get through traffic jams? Worst of all, will the traffic manager&#151;who may or may not be a local authority employee&#151;have targets for cutting delays?
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para5"></a>How will all that work? I can just see it coming. Oxfordshire County Council, for example&#151;as I live in Oxford I am using this example&#151;will give a contract to Capita, which will make a profit or loss depending on whether it has achieved its targets. The amendment is based on good principles but I can see it snowballing. I think that we have a lot more work to do on the idea.
<P>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 68</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para6"></a>I agree that there should be no discrimination between the local authorities resurfacing the roads. They also have a habit of digging things up but then discovering that they do not have the right type of stone&#151;as happened in a large shopping street in Oxford where the cost has increased by God knows how many times and delays have been occurring for several years. They are not immune from it, and there is a reason for that. However, I think that a few more questions need to be answered before we decide whether this amendment should be made in this form. In principle, however, I support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-24_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I have a very simple definition of what I regard as an "emergency" in the essential services, whether it be gas, electricity, water or telecommunications; it is whether they fail in my street. For the benefit of any utilities that might read Hansard, that is Chester Street. If they fail in anyone else's street, I regard it as a service supply problem that can be dealt with when convenient. I am afraid that that is what most people think about emergency services. If it matters to us we care deeply about it and we want it fixed as soon as possible. Although it is somewhat unfair to assume that utility companies dig up the road because they enjoy doing so and enjoy watching us queuing in the traffic&#151;after all, it costs them money&#151;that does not mean that they always do it efficiently or in the right way or at the right time.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para7"></a>We know from the Department for Transport's own surveys that half of the congestion caused by roadworks is the responsibility of the utility companies and half is the responsibility of the local authorities' activities. I can see that there will be conflict between a traffic manager employed by a local authority and the rest of that authority. He will be saying, "We have to have a flow of traffic; otherwise I am not doing my duty", and someone else in the authority will be saying, "We want street lighting here and something else there". There will be conflict. However, if the responsibility is contracted out as the Government want, the traffic manager can be reached only via a call centre in Bombay. God knows how the interface will work.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para8"></a>That difficulty will exist and it will put the traffic manager in a difficult situation with some of his colleagues. I am therefore interested in the part of the amendment that would become paragraph (c). It seems to offer a way, as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said, of ranking local authorities alongside utilities. I think that that is a good way of expressing what we would like to do. If this part of the amendment were accepted, it would give the traffic manager the power to say to the rest of his authority, "The work you want to do must rank alongside that of the utilities. Therefore you must take the same things into consideration when you plan to do those works". I think that that would help the traffic manager. It would make life easier and give a clearer authority for <P>

I would wish for Chapel Street to be well looked after at the expense of his road, Chester Street. I very much hope that the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, can hear me. The first Question I heard when I arrived here three or four years ago was one asked by him about the Strand, which utilities were digging up, all at the same time, which was appalling. I have followed his campaign ever since. I admire and agree with everything he has said about roads in London. I hope that the noble Lord can hear me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-24_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   Yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-24_spnew8"></A><B> Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Good. Amendment No. 70 would place on the face of the Bill a requirement for traffic authorities to consider the importance of street works when making arrangements for meeting their duty and to ensure that they do not give preferential treatment to their own works.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para9"></a>Utility works benefit individuals, businesses and the economy as a whole. Clearly, we have no interest in preventing these activities. That is addressed through the drafting of the main duty along with existing legislation.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para10"></a>Utility companies already have a statutory right to carry out their own works to install or maintain their apparatus. The duty placed on highway authorities in Part 2 will not change that. What we are aiming to achieve through the network management duty is the better management of both utility works and authorities' own works. In order to do that, authorities will need to consider the way that all works are co-ordinated and carried out. That should be based on an objective assessment and decisions taken on the basis of the best overall outcome without discrimination.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para11"></a>Amendment No. 70A aims to provide an example of something that would be considered as having insignificant effect, and therefore could be disregarded while meeting the network management duty. Clause 17(4) recognises that an element of proportionality is required in meeting the duty. However, here we have chosen not to offer examples or illustrative lists in order to avoid the risk of appearing either to give undue weight to some things or to dismiss others by virtue of omission.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para12"></a>During the last sitting of the Grand Committee, we debated the merits of including various levels of detail in the guidance issued under Clause 18 rather than on the face of the Bill. To assist deliberation of Part 1, I <P>


<a name="column_70"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 70</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sent a draft of the network management duty guidance to those who tabled amendments, and copies were made available to those who participated in the first day of Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para13"></a>Before I talk about the guidance in relation to the amendments, I should like to take the opportunity to state for the record that there was an omission on the covering sheet of the draft provided. While the title of the document and the main text made it clear that it was a draft of the Clause 18 guidance, regrettably, the covering sheet omitted the word "guidance" from the first sentence&#151; how many noble Lords noticed that? That has been corrected in the copies available today.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para14"></a>The draft guidance shows how a clear message can be sent to local authorities on the scope of the duty, and the arrangements that would need to be in place for meeting it. That is in contrast with Amendments Nos. 70 and 70A, which illustrate the danger of losing the focus of the duty by adding additional strands through primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, referred at the last sitting to the question of primacy or priority of the duty as set out in Clause 16 and to how that relates to paragraph 13 of the draft guidance. The question of primacy is at the heart of Amendment No. 70. Clause 16 places a network management duty upon local traffic authorities, which will mean that it should be given due consideration with resulting action to address problems.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para16"></a>Paragraph 13 of the draft guidance explains the qualification of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"so far as may be reasonably practicable having regard to other obligations, policies and objectives".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-24_para17"></a>
That means that the duty is placed alongside all the other things that an authority has to consider, and it does not take precedence. But the statutory duty reflects the importance placed on making best use of existing roads for the benefit of all road users.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para18"></a>The guidance gives an example of road safety. No responsible authority would take the duty as a licence to ignore the need to reduce the number of people killed or injured on our roads. As my noble friend said at the last sitting, we recognise that local authorities have competing obligations; that is the nature of their work. What is quite clear is that this legislation will emphasise a greater role for the local authorities to address themselves to traffic management.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, also asked during the last sitting for clarification of how paragraph 14 of the draft guidance sat with the Bill. I think that it is worth taking a few moments here to offer that explanation as it relates to the wider point raised by these amendments&#151;the need to retain the focus of the duty in primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para20"></a>Paragraph 14 of the draft guidance elaborates on the need for local traffic authorities to think about the road network beyond administrative boundaries. That directly relates to Clause 16(1)(b), which requires that authorities facilitate
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the expeditious movement of traffic on road networks for which another authority is the traffic authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-24_para21"></a><P>


<a name="column_71"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para22"></a>The draft guidance goes on to give an explanation of the reasoning behind that. As I believe was said on the first day of Grand Committee, road users do not generally view the road network as divided between local authorities. They use the network as a whole, irrespective of who is responsible. Under the duty, an authority needs to consider not only its own network but the effects of its actions on the networks of others, which is a very important point. That is to achieve the best operation of the network as a whole, especially in conurbations where networks of adjacent authorities can be highly inter-related.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para23"></a>I should like to comment on the words of my noble friend Lord Borrie. Obviously, we want both utility works and local authorities' own works to be done efficiently. The cliche here, of course, is a level playing field for both as far as possible. However, it is not always possible to treat both types of work in exactly the same way. Charging for highway works would mean, in effect, local authorities charging themselves.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para24"></a>The network management duty requires local authorities to look at all works. The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, talked of the importance of the Internet. The regulation-making powers in Parts 3 and 4 are wide enough to take into account emergencies on matters such as urgent connections. There are already similar provisions for regulations in the 1991 Act. These appear to have worked quite well.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, made some very interesting points. Part of the Bill's thrust is towards better planning by utilities, for example encouraging them to carry stocks so that the sort of thing he illustrated does not happen. Obviously, we do not agree with the improper use of emergency powers by the utilities. We simply do not condone that.
<P>

<a name="40427-24_para26"></a>I hope on the basis of this rather lengthy explanation&#151;and I apologise for that&#151;that these amendments can be withdrawn.

<A NAME="40427-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I thank the Minister for his comprehensive survey of the situation on the amendments and other noble Lords for their contributions.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para0"></a>I was struck by one phrase of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton of Yeovil. He said that roads are designed for movement. Indeed they are, but they are also designed to contain a number of artefacts under and over them. The public have a tremendous interest in their adequate maintenance, servicing and so on. Both noble Lords, Lord Peyton and Lord Bradshaw, were concerned with the abuses by the utilities&#151;at any rate in the past&#151;in certain respects of what they are allowed to do, and not completing the work that they may have begun.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, referred to the misuse of so-called "emergencies". I shall not say any more about that at the moment. I have an amendment relating to that under the permit scheme. The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, has kindly remained with us, although he threatened to depart shortly. He will know that there is a definition of "emergency" in the 1991 Act. The Government have not chosen to put one into this Bill. We may return to that in due course.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para2"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Berkeley for his words of support for my amendment. However, he very rightly was concerned with how to achieve a balance&#151;if one is asking for a balance to be made&#151;between the needs to avoid congestion on the one hand and the needs of the public to have proper supplies of gas, electricity, telecom facilities and so on. That is an extremely important question. I am sure my noble friend would agree that one cannot possibly deal in the Bill with how such a balance can be achieved. That does not mean that&#151;and I hope he agrees with me&#151;trying to instruct an authority to seek to obtain a balance between concern with congestion on the one hand and concern about proper utility facilities on the other should be set out in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para3"></a>I say "in the Bill". There is an argument here, as no doubt there will be in other discussions that we shall have later this afternoon, on whether doing so in draft guidance or in regulations can be sufficient or perhaps more desirable and achieve greater flexibility than doing so in the Bill itself. I am not sure that the Minister has answered me fully on whether merely stressing a balance should be drawn should be excluded from the wording of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Before the noble Lord withdraws his amendment, I thank the Minister for his answers to the questions I asked when the Committee last sat. I shall read them carefully because they were quite dense. I shall make sure, but from my first reaction I was content with what he said.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para4"></a>Secondly, I should like to draw the Minister briefly on the meaning of "insignificant". The Government must have some idea what they mean by the word. Even if the Minister will not give examples, can he enlarge on the issue? Does it mean the sort of thing that takes a day and it is just there for a day. Is that insignificant or significant?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I am advised that it depends on the circumstances. A very small object on a very busy road is significant. A very small object, such as a brick, on a side road or a country lane does not have the same significance. That is how we are defining "significance".

<P>
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: This is another of those "level playing field" amendments, although it seems to be a very large one. The amendment is intended to ensure that utilities companies are placed on a so-called level playing field with local authorities. It will encourage local traffic authorities to publish information about the highways authorities' works on roads in order to enhance the accountability of the highways authority in carrying out, and the traffic authority in monitoring, such works.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para9"></a>As we have heard from noble Lords speaking today and on Second Reading, a variety of utility groups are concerned about the lack of equality in how they and the local authorities will be treated under the Bill. Utilities and local authorities are equally responsible for avoidable street works. They should both be subject to the same rules and requirements.

<a name="40427-25_para10"></a>If local authorities and the Highways Agency do not come fully within the scope of the Bill, improvements in co-ordinating street works will not materialise as utilities will be unable readily to align their works with those of local authorities. The Government have stressed repeatedly the even-handed nature of the Bill. However, it remains the case that the highways authorities, which are responsible for half the works in our streets, are also charged with approving and policing the works of the utilities companies, which are responsible for the other half. That, in itself, is an unequal situation which should be recognised.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para11"></a>The amendment requires the highways authorities to provide data on the conduct and performance of their own works. That will provide the basic information by which others can check that highways authorities properly carry out their duties. It is therefore fully in line with the Government's stated intentions for the Bill and I am sure that it will be welcomed&#151;at least, I hope that it will be.

<a name="40427-25_para12"></a>The Government may argue that Clause 19 meets the requirements of the amendment. However, Clause 19 does not set out a general duty to provide information; rather, it is apparently intended to assist the national authority when it believes that a traffic authority may not properly be exercising its network management duty. It merely gives the national authority the power to serve a direction asking for specific information from a traffic authority. Information would be provided only when such a direction was served and then only to the national authority and only in relation to the items which happened to be specified in the notice.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para13"></a>This amendment, therefore, is necessary to ensure that local traffic authorities publish information about the highways authority works in the road in order to enhance the accountability of the highways authority in carrying out and the traffic authority in monitoring such works. It also helps with the Government's often stated intention to bring local authorities more fully within the same requirement that applies to utility companies.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para14"></a>The amendment gives the Government the opportunity to demonstrate in the Bill the assurances they have given that it applies to the highways authorities and utilities in equal measure. At present, their assurances have failed to assuage the fears of the utility companies. As BT has succinctly put it, it is the utilities that will feel the full weight of the new rules and penalties following enactment of the Bill&#151;local authorities will not. So I challenge the Minister to prove this belief wrong by accepting the amendment.

<A NAME="40427-25_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   This may not be the right amendment to speak to, but it reminds me of some extremely good lobbying that I experienced earlier. It pointed out that Susiephone worked extremely well in Scotland and Northern Ireland so that people could see what works were coming up and dovetail their works with it. Utilities were very willing to fit in wherever they could.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para15"></a>I suspect that the amendment is looking only at retrospective publishing of what is going on, so I am not sure I am speaking to the right amendment, if it exists. Perhaps my remarks could be applied to whichever amendment is most suitable. The publication of this sort of information relating to future and planned works by the network manager would be extremely useful to everybody concerned and would probably do a lot more than penalties and threats to achieve the desired result.

<FONT SIZE=3>national authority power to make regulations on the content of the street works information and when it must be published.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para17"></a>In principle, we would encourage authorities to make relevant publicity available wherever possible. Indeed, there is already a duty under Section 53 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, which covers much of what the amendment looks to achieve. Section 53 enables regulations to be made by the appropriate national authority, requiring local authorities to keep a register of undertakers' street works and their own works for road purposes. These are the categories to which the amendment refers.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para18"></a>Regulations under Section 53 can prescribe the information to be recorded and can therefore include the duration, location and extent of works&#151;the items listed in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40427-25_para19"></a>In addition, Clause 44 allows the scope of the register to be widened to cover skips, scaffolding and related structures and records of the location of apparatus already in the street.

<a name="column_76"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 76</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>to Greater London Authority and strategic roads about the techniques of network management and any other matter relating to the performance of the duties imposed by sections 16 and 17."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-26_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 74, to which the noble Lords, Lord Marsh and Lord Rotherwick, and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, have added their names. The amendment is based on the premise that London is unique in a number of ways. First, its roads are administered by no fewer than 35 highway authorities. That is partly a consequence of London having very high population density, which is 13 times the national average, and of the comparatively small areas being covered by each borough. The average size of boroughs in London is 50 square kilometres, against 350 square kilometres for districts nationally. Secondly, Transport for London's 580 kilometres of GLA roads pass through 32 of the 33 boroughs. Thirdly, London is the fifth largest urban area in the world.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para6"></a>The amendment would take proper cognisance of those factors and give the Mayor the ability to issue guidance supplementary to that of the Secretary of State about the network management duty in London. That mayoral guidance would relate to GLA roads and borough "strategic roads". TfL believes that some 1,500 kilometres of the 13,000 kilometres of borough roads should be designated by the Secretary of State as strategic. It seeks common standards of operation and coherence in the conditions attached to access for the maintenance of the highways themselves and utilities' plant beneath. Such guidance would extend to common winter maintenance standards such as gritting; common regimes for street cleaning and routine maintenance; and common standards in signing.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para7"></a>Local highway management policies vary, as typified by winter gritting arrangements. Boroughs can choose whether to grit or not, even on the same route. Bus routes are not restricted to individual boroughs and a single route might therefore pass through as many as six boroughs. The choice of one borough not to grit can restrict vehicular movement and deprive residents in other areas of London of their bus service.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para8"></a>There is of course no need for London's roads all to be managed identically. Local residential roads should be managed to meet residents' needs. However, the London-specific guidance needs to focus primarily on strategic routes used by the majority of Londoners for many journeys. TfL has defined a "network of interest" which identifies those strategic routes. The network is 2,000 kilometres in length. It comprises 16 per cent of the length of London's roads and is used for about two-thirds of all journeys. It includes the GLA roads, the A roads and major bus routes.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para9"></a>On strategic routes, there is a particular need for the co-ordination of works and other planned obstructions. The utility service operators and highways authorities each carry out about half of all works on London's roads. Altogether, about 140 organisations have the right to dig up the roads. Many of these will need to liaise with all 35 highways authorities and, therefore, need to have a single administrative system for notifying works and plans, unless undue costs are to be incurred and passed on to <P>


<a name="column_77"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 77</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Londoners. TfL's LondonWorks is being developed to provide just such a single process, to capture all the necessary information about all works.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para10"></a>London's special transport needs have been recognised already in the creation of the GLA network for which TfL is the highway authority, the only such urban network in the United Kingdom. TfL's role already reaches across the whole of London&#151;it is the owner and operator of all the 4,800 sets of traffic signals, for example&#151;and the London Traffic Control Centre has a London-wide remit. Transport for London is also the manager of one of the main public transport services.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para11"></a>When a number of your Lordships, myself included, visited the London Traffic Control Centre on 30 March, TfL made clear to us that it can do a great deal to help the London boroughs in their efforts to meet the requirements of the new Bill and specifically the network management duty. The fact that the Government have already acknowledged the need to designate strategic borough roads in London and to provide TfL with a degree of oversight as to how those roads are developed shows, I hope, that they have accepted the logic behind this argument.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para12"></a>I believe that it is entirely appropriate, therefore, that London's need for strategic transport management is reflected in powers for the Mayor to issue London-specific guidance that will seek coherence in the daily operational management of strategic borough roads. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-26_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I put my name to the amendment following our debate on Second Reading where, indeed, I raised this issue. I think that the issue of strategic roads is certainly important.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para13"></a>Meanwhile, although I have had not exactly second thoughts, situations have arisen which require closer inspection. I was particularly drawn to an article in the Times which says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Ken Livingstone withheld 1.5 million worth of funding yesterday from a council that is challenging his anti-car agenda by ripping out road humps and bus and cycle lanes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-26_para14"></a>
We will debate road humps and bus and cycle lanes in later debates. The article continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Mayor . . .  claimed that the London Borough of Barnet was endangering pedestrians by allowing cars to drive uninterrupted down residential streets and park on wide pavements. His attack came as the London Assembly prepared to publish a report which says that 'humps are neither the only nor necessarily the best tool in the box'".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-26_para15"></a>
Ken Livingstone was quoted as saying:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Barnet's half-baked policies are putting children's lives at risk. We are not going to allow that to be undermined by the loony Right in Barnet council".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-26_para16"></a>
Well, it is loony Right meets loony Left as far as one can see. Mr Livingstone went on to say that the money would be withheld,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"pending an investigation by Transport for London".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-26_para17"></a>
The Conservative councillor, Brian Coleman, put up a robust defence and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"said lawyers had advised him that Mr Livingstone could not withhold the money as the council had the power to determine policy on traffic on local roads".
<P>

<a name="column_78"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 78</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para19"></a>I have no idea whether Barnet council's view on road humps is the correct one or not, but it clearly feels that it is, and it clearly feels that it is within its powers and remit to decide what its policy should be. The Mayor has another view. He is perfectly entitled to that other view. I do not know the merits of that. However, it seems to me that, as the councillor suggests, the Mayor is not entitled to withhold funding because he does not agree with the policy. I therefore ask the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, and the Minister whether the matter would be improved by guidance, or would guidance allow the Mayor to issue guidance that could conflict with national guidance? The London Local Government Association has expressed concern that such guidance could conflict with national guidance.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para20"></a>I understand that Transport for London has not consulted the Association of London Government or the boroughs about this amendment. That is something they need to do if noble Lords are to consider the amendment seriously between now and Report, and I would urge them to do so. It seems to me that this is an important issue. We all understand the importance of strategic roads throughout London. If strategic roads do not work through London, everything else gets jammed.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, was right when he spoke about gritting; the fact that different boroughs have different policies; and indeed that buses might go through six boroughs. So this is important. However, we want to ensure that the guidance does not give Transport for London the power to have a sudden large expansion of a strategic route network without adequately considering whether roads are strategic. Indeed, we want to ensure that any guidance that is issued fits clearly with that issued by the department.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para22"></a>While I am concerned about strategic roads and think that there is a lot to be said for Transport for London having a co-ordinated policy with the boroughs, I am not 100 per cent convinced that the amendment is the way to do that. I am happy to be convinced, but the one thing I am clear about is that Transport for London has not yet done enough work with the boroughs, nor had enough discussions with them to explain to them how they think this would work for me to be 100 per cent comfortable with the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I was one of the people who visited Transport for London. I think that it was amply demonstrated to us that there is a need for a co-ordinated approach to strategic roads. I would remind the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that Ken Livingstone is not a permanent fixture and that we are making laws for the future&#151;not for the next few months of Ken Livingstone's reign in London.
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para23"></a>We are addressing the issue of whether the strategic network&#151;basically, the main bus routes&#151;should be subject to oversight, which should be made the subject of guidance, and that any person in a borough should not be allowed to do anything to interfere with the operation of bus routes, which affect all Londoners. In some respects, to allow them to do so would fly in the face of the whole purpose of setting up Transport for London, which has London-wide duties.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-26_para24"></a>While I am perfectly at ease with the fact that someone in Barnet can pursue his policies off the strategic network, I rather think he should not pursue them on it because of the knock-on effects, which are considerable. When we went to visit Transport for London we were shown the very sophisticated systems for bringing together the roadworks of the utilities, the borough and Transport for London so that proper co-ordination could be effected. We were assured that the boroughs all had both an input and an output from the system. So, it is a genuine system which allows people to see what each other are planning before they make plans. The amendment is not tabled in my name, but I believe that it is one which the Government should seriously consider accepting.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040427/text/40427-27.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My name is not added to the amendment, but I rise to support it and to speak also to my Amendment No. 75, which is in this group.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para0"></a>First, as I said, I support Amendment No. 74. I, too, visited TfL's control centre. As an example of the need for TfL to have some control over the traffic in borough strategic roads, TfL quoted to us the fact that Westminster Bridge and the Embankment are TfL roads whereas Whitehall, which takes one or two buses during the day, is a Westminster City Council road. Clearly, it is stupid for TfL not to have any role in deciding what happens to Whitehall as it is a major London bus route. One can give many other examples. I firmly believe that it is essential that TfL should have this role, obviously, working with the boroughs. If the Bill is going to make any sense whatever in terms of traffic management in a city such as London, TfL must have a role.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para1"></a>Perhaps I could now turn to Amendment No. 75. I shall not repeat what my noble friend Lord Faulkner said about the need for Amendment No. 74. I thought it would be useful to discuss whether the same rules should apply to certain roles in the Royal Parks. Clearly, that is not so for all Royal Parks and not all roads. However, I can think of the Mall, Constitution Hill and maybe Birdcage Walk in London&#151;and there are probably others further out from the centre&#151;where it would do no harm for TfL to have a role in traffic management rather than just the Royal Parks doing it. I suspect that there is a technical reason why my amendment would not work. Ministers would say that it is wrong for an authority such as TfL to give the Government advice, because&#151;under SI 1997/1639, the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997, of which I happen to have a copy&#151;the Government run the Royal Parks. I shall refer to that later.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para2"></a>I put that to one side for the moment. The gritting issue mentioned by my noble friend Lord Faulkner applies equally to Royal Parks. I have been told that when we had the snowfall this winter they managed to grit a road about 50 feet wide through the middle of Hyde Park, which takes no traffic whatever. I think that they did it so that the police could go and have their cups of tea more safely. But they did not grit the strategic cycle route. When I phoned up to complain they said that they did not have enough staff. I asked: "You are expecting us to bicycle up Park Lane in the snowstorm, are you?" He said: "Yes, basically".
<P>


<a name="column_80"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 80</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para3"></a>I do not think that that is acceptable. It is a strategic cycle route. There are many strategic roads in the Royal Parks about which TfL might do rather better if it had some role. I have also heard that the Royal Parks have a habit of closing the Mall or Constitution Hill without giving any notice. Processions are planned months, if not years ahead. It is ridiculous that TfL is not told. Closing those roads causes gridlock over half of West London. So I think that there is an important role for TfL.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para4"></a>I know that there is better co-ordination coming, but I think that TfL should have the same responsibility for certain roads in the Royal Parks, which we can call strategic, as is planned in Amendment No. 74 for local authorities. In fact, I should like to discuss with my noble friend the Minister between now and Report the transfer of both highway and traffic authority responsibility to local authorities for roads in the Royal Parks. I think that an amendment is needed to the statutory instrument because, frankly, the way the Royal Parks go about running the transport it could do with some amendment.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para5"></a>The Government are in charge of regulations against kite flying in the Royal Park. Paragraph 4(18) on page 4 of this lovely statutory instrument states that one cannot,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"take photographs of still or moving subjects".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-27_para6"></a>
There are lots more things one is not allowed to do. It really is time&#151;shall we say&#151;to bring the Royal Parks into the 21st century rather than have Victorian rules for carriages where the riff-raff go on foot and on bicycles. Frankly, I sometimes feel like riff-raff when going through the parks. That subject is for another day. I believe that it is very important that TfL should be able to give guidance to the Royal Parks on certain roads.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Amendment No. 74 would give the Mayor power to issue statutory guidance to boroughs on the network management duty in relation to the strategic road network. I suspect that I am in total agreement with the spirit of the amendment, if not the method employed.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para7"></a>London provides specific challenges in terms of the network management duty. There is the importance of the strategic road network, the proximity of the boroughs and the fact that the actions of any authority can quickly have an impact on the roads of another.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para8"></a>Road users have a right to expect a consistent approach to network management across the capital. As a result of the Bill, TfL and the boroughs, individually and collectively, will need to work closely to deliver the duty.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para9"></a>All parties would have to ensure that their arrangements for meeting the duty were compatible. There would need to be a degree of predictability in responses to events, from emergencies to bad weather. Mechanisms would also be required for sharing the information needed to manage the whole network in London, both strategically and on a day-to-day basis. <P>


<a name="column_81"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>In addition, due regard would need to be given to TfL's leading role in providing strategic operational co-ordination.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para10"></a>All of this suggests the need for the ALG and the boroughs to reach agreement with TfL at an early stage on how to achieve these objectives. Ministers have made this clear to TfL and the ALG and, together with the DfT, they are working to ensure that the guidance provides a framework for delivering the outcomes needed for the duty to be met seamlessly across the capital.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para11"></a>Turning to the specifics of the amendment, the guidance issued under Clause 18 will cover all that is necessary in terms of the principles of the network management duty generally, along with any special features for London. We recognise that there will need to be arrangements between TfL and the boroughs but these are not appropriate for statutory guidance.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para12"></a>Amendment No. 75 seeks to give the Mayor power to issue statutory guidance to the Royal Parks Agency on the network management duty in relation to its roads in greater London. Some of the roads in London's Royal Parks contribute to the operation of the wider network, with others, of a more local nature, providing access to the parks themselves. All, though, are important for pedestrians, cyclists and others who want to enjoy our wonderful parks.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para13"></a>More importantly, as far as the amendment is concerned, the Royal Parks Agency is an agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The amendment would, in effect, be giving power to the Mayor to issue statutory guidance to the Secretary of State. This would be inappropriate, and I am sure that my right honourable friend the Minister in another place would totally agree. However, I am sure that, where necessary, the Royal Parks Agency will liaise with the neighbouring boroughs and Transport for London over matters on their roads that could affect the movement of vehicles and pedestrians on the surrounding network, and vice versa.

Some 18 months ago the Mall was closed and Constitution Hill is frequently closed. When the Mall was closed and Trafalgar Square was being rebuilt the ensuing chaos was absolutely horrendous. It was my understanding that Transport for London was not informed of what was going on. If the relevant mechanism is in place, as the Minister says that it is, why is it not being put into operation?

<a name="40427-27_para15"></a>My noble friend Lord Faulkner made two points to which I wish to respond. The strategic borough roads are being considered by a working group. In a few moments I shall talk about the working groups that play a central role in this Bill. They will inform the designation of the strategic roads as referred to in Part 5 of the Bill. This group has not yet completed its definition of the network. While the groups recognise the importance of TfL's network of interest, it does not follow that this level of network will be designated as strategic.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, referred to bus routes going through multiple boroughs which may have different policies towards transport. However, Clause 16(1)(b) requires them to facilitate the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"movement of traffic on road networks for which another authority is the traffic authority",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-27_para17"></a>
and will cover that point. We shall expand on that matter in the London section of the network management duty guidance.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said that bus routes are important. Undoubtedly they are, but the extent of the strategic borough roads under Part 5 of the Bill is still under discussion. However, we absolutely take that point on board.
<P>

<a name="40427-27_para19"></a>Given that and the work already in hand to cover the specific circumstances in London through the guidance, I hope that these amendments will be withdrawn.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   I should like to start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and my noble friend Lord Berkeley for their support for my amendment. I should have said when I spoke earlier how strongly I supported the amendment of my noble friend Lord Berkeley in relation to the Royal Parks.
<P>

<a name="40427-28_para0"></a>I also very much welcome what my noble friend the Minister said. I wrote down the words, "in total sympathy with the spirit of the amendment". I am slightly surprised that my co-signatory on the amendment was clearly not in total sympathy with its spirit or, indeed, with any part of it. Clearly, he has been got at not only by his political friends from the London borough of Barnet but also, I fear, by the Association of London Government, the quality of whose briefing for this debate, I have to say, is less than adequate and less than entirely convincing. For example, it contains the sentence,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Transport for London has not consulted the Association of London Government nor the London boroughs on this proposed amendment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-28_para1"></a>
I am advised that a meeting took place under the auspices of government a full week before the ALG published its briefing at which they were told all about the amendment that Transport for London sought to introduce.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-28_para2"></a>On the point that the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, made about road humps in Barnet, there is no possibility that local roads in Barnet, whether they have road humps or not, will ever be designated as strategic roads. This amendment has nothing at all to do with local roads and local road safety needs but with the strategic roads to which my noble friend referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I referred to Barnet not just in connection with road humps but also in connection with bus lanes. That seemed to me to be relevant. I have sympathy with the reasons for introducing a strategic road network. However, having looked at the amendment carefully, I question whether it would make a difference. I must say I tend to agree with the Government on the matter. I am with the noble Lord in spirit, but the question is, does the amendment work? The matter concerns bus and cycle lanes which could, indeed, be classified by Transport for London as being within the strategic network.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   I seem to remember that my noble friend the Minister referred to bus lanes specifically in the context, I believe, of Clause 16 where there is provision for bus lanes and bus provision to be taken into account. If Barnet chooses to sabotage bus lane policy, it will surely not be able to do that when the bus lanes are on strategic routes that serve other boroughs as well.
<P>

<a name="40427-28_para3"></a>I am heartened by what my noble friend said. I shall read it very carefully. I am sure that there will be a number of discussions before Report. I shall briefly give way to my noble friend Lord Berkeley before I withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I am very grateful to my noble friend. One thing we have not covered is what happens to Highways Agency roads in London. Is TfL able to give guidance to the odd Highways Agency motorway in London? It would be nice if it could because otherwise one wonders about the communication in that regard. I am not sure that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport would be very interested in taking advice from Mr Livingstone, or his Liberal Democrat successor if that unlikely event occurs in June, on the roads in the Royal Parks. I wonder why the Secretary of State really wants to hold on to these beastly roads. Perhaps we could talk about that outside the Committee and bring forward some amendments at the next stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   There is to be some guidance published about roads in London. However, we are being asked to take quite a lot on trust. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, watched a programme yesterday in which traffic officers appeared to be commencing their work on the M62. However, we have not gone through the relevant legislative process for that. Apparently, those people were interviewed on the "Today" programme yesterday.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   Who were they employed by?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I do not know. However, as I say, we are taking a lot on trust. When we consider this amendment again at another stage, I hope that we <P>


<a name="column_84"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 84</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>shall have sight of the guidance. We are being asked to take things on trust in the absence of the guidance which would set our minds at rest, if it were available.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I, too, saw the "Today" programme and asked what was happening. The people in the programme are simply going out with the police. They have no powers. Under the provisions in the Bill they will be able to proceed on their own without being accompanied by the police whereas at the moment the traffic control officers have to be accompanied by a policeman or woman. We have not put the provisions of the Bill into action before it has passed through the Palace of Westminster.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   As my noble friend used the term "traffic control officers", is this a suitable time to table a further amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I was simply trying to be helpful in explaining what I saw on television. If I used the incorrect title, I apologise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   I am sure that the Grand Committee is very grateful for the Minister's help while going down a little bit of a side road, having been encouraged to do so by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. I had almost finished what I had to say. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) The guidance shall cover, among other matters, the respective responsibility of a local traffic authority, the police and the fire service to attend to spillages of diesel fuel and render the road safe again for the passage of motorcycles and other vehicles."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-28_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: As I pointed out at Second Reading, the provisions for motorcyclists and bicyclists within the management of our road network mean that police conducting traffic duties owe no duty of care to protect road users from hazards of which the police officers have been made aware.
<P>

<a name="40427-28_para8"></a>Contact with diesel fuel, even a very small amount, hit at low speeds has devastating effects on motorcyclists and bicyclists alike. I myself have suffered two terrifying incidents when coming into contact with spilt diesel on my powered two-wheeler. The first incident occurred a number of years ago while going round Shepherd's Bush roundabout. I had no warning as I did not see what I was about to hit. I found myself sliding sideways on the road. Fortunately, the traffic was congested, was travelling slowly and everyone stopped. The second incident was even more alarming. On turning right at a junction at traffic lights, I hit what turned out to be spilt diesel. I parted company from my motorcycle and slid into a petrol station. It came to rest at a petrol pump. I am glad to say that no vehicle was in its path. I am even more glad that no pedestrian was in its path; otherwise, someone could have suffered serious injury. I came away with only a few scratches.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-28_para9"></a>However, I would not want the Committee to think that this amendment is tabled purely from self-interest. It would constitute an addition that I believe would reflect the Government's desire to improve the safety of all two-wheelers. The recently published three-year review, Tomorrow's roads&#151;safer for everyone, devotes a chapter to safer motorcycling. That, the creation of the advisory group on motorcycling and the steps to improve rider training and testing are all to be applauded. However, much more needs to be done. As the review itself acknowledges,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Despite the improved KSI&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-28_para10"></a>
that is, killed and seriously injured&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and slight casualty rates, there is a concern that motorcyclists continue to be disproportionately represented in casualty numbers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-28_para11"></a>
Indeed, the review showed that motorcyclists,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"accounted for 18% of fatalities in 2002 and statistics show that motorcyclists are 30 times more likely to be killed than car users and four times more likely to be killed than cyclists".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-28_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40427-28_para13"></a>If I had been in a car when I hit the diesel patch, the worst that could have happened was that another car could have run into the back of mine. However, a motorcyclist or a cyclist lying prone on the tarmac is liable to be squashed. That is a real concern.
<P>

<a name="40427-28_para14"></a>I give an example of that. The decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Ancell and Another v McDermott and Others in 1993 shows that police officers are currently not required to remain at the scene of a diesel spillage. The case arose in the wake of a fatal accident on a roundabout at Airport Way in Luton where a fuel tank had ruptured and spilt its diesel fuel all over the road. Shortly after the spillage a Hertfordshire police vehicle drove past the spillage, notified the Bedfordshire police of the hazard but did not return to the roundabout. Bedfordshire police reported the matter to the Highways Agency. But, sadly and tragically, minutes later Mrs Ancell skidded on the fuel, lost control of her car and collided with a lorry. She died from the injuries that she sustained in the accident.
<P>

<a name="40427-28_para15"></a>There are legitimate concerns that such a duty of care would impose on the police force a potential liability with too wide a scope. However, it is possible to draw a parallel between the duty of care as put forward in this amendment and that of the Highways Agency in England and Wales outlined in Section 111 of the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 which states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to ensure, so far as it is reasonably practicable, that safe passage along a highway is not endangered by snow or ice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-28_para16"></a>
One has great sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, who slipped on snow and ice while riding his bicycle. I tend not to use my bicycle or motorcycle when there is snow or ice on the road as one cannot control such vehicles in such conditions. It is also difficult to see ice before one is on top of it.
<P>

<a name="40427-28_para17"></a>If the Minister were minded to oppose the amendment, I would ask him nevertheless to consider asking the police or other emergency services and the local authorities to recommend guidelines to the Secretary of State that would in some other way give effect to such provision in the Bill. The British <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Motorcyclists Federation, the UK's largest riders' organisation, has been looking for many years for a way to tackle the hazard of spilt diesel fuel.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-28_spnew12"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, on this amendment. I was speaking to a traffic officer friend of mine&#151;I suppose that for the purposes of the Bill I should say that he is a police traffic officer&#151;of many years' experience. He said that in the past he had always considered the fact that people came off their cycles or motorcycles on a diesel spillage as totally incomprehensible; he could not understand it. He then went on holiday to France on his motorcycle with a number of other police traffic officers and on two occasions he came off his motorcycle. Only then did he realise that one can do absolutely nothing. You just fall off&#151;bang; it is over. I therefore believe that this amendment is very important and highly relevant.
<P>

<a name="40427-28_para18"></a>The noble Lord draws attention also to the KSI figures which are also relevant for motorcyclists. Those figures have been increasing in recent years. Unless something is done they will continue to increase.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-29_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My noble friend Lord Rotherwick has done the Grand Committee a service by drawing our attention to the perils of spilt diesel. Although my noble friend undoubtedly has fallen off more horses than motorcycles, he raises this important issue. I should declare an interest as a sometime motorcyclist.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para0"></a>I suspect that the Minister might argue that Clause 18 is not necessarily the place for this provision; I look forward to hearing from him. None the less, we need clarification of the duty of the police and the highways authorities to protect motorcyclists and other road users from diesel spillages and to ensure that those are dealt with promptly and safely. I would certainly appreciate it if the Minister could clarify the situation and draw the Committee's attention to any measures the Government might have in mind to improve the situation.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para1"></a>This is not an imaginary difficulty and we are not asking the Government to prevent diesel being spilt&#151;of course that cannot happen. However, when it does occur, the police should make every effort to ensure that motorcyclists and other road users are protected. Serious accidents can result.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I rise briefly to support the amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, said, it applies to cycles as well as motor bicycles. I look upon a diesel spill as more like an obstruction in the road, such as those caused by digging up services or resurfacing, except that it is a real emergency. Regardless of whether the police or the traffic officers&#151;or whatever they are going to be called&#151;should attend in the first instance, clearly someone <P>


<a name="column_87"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 87</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>needs to be there to stop vehicles going too fast and running into or over those who have fallen off. As the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, said, once you have fallen off your bike or motorbike you are lying in the road and you are very vulnerable. That is why the accident figures are higher. In a car you are in a nice cocooned space and, as long as you stay in the car, you will probably be all right. I think that this is a good role for traffic officers. Such spillages should be regarded as an emergency obstruction on the road.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   May I start by saying that we have every sympathy with everything that has been said? The amendment gives me an opportunity to explain how various groups of stakeholders are helping the Government to develop guidance. One of the groups is working very hard on this very area.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para2"></a>As I will be mentioning working groups in relation to a number of other amendments, let me say here that a working group and an advisory group have been set up by the DfT to help develop both the guidance documents in Part 2&#151;the network management duty guidance in Clause 18 and the guidance on criteria for intervention in Clause 27. There are separate groups working on other parts of the Bill which I will touch on when we reach the relevant provisions.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para3"></a>The group working on the matters we are discussing today consists of local authority practitioners and includes representatives of organisations such as the LGA and the Association of London Government, CSS&#151;formerly the County Surveyors' Society&#151;and the Technical Advisory Group. The advisory group is made up of representatives of all the major road users' groups and includes wider organisations such as the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety and the CBI. There will also be public consultation. I wish to assure noble Lords that the issues we are talking about are fully understood and we recognise that they have to be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para4"></a>We understand the concern of road users and cyclists and motor cyclists, in particular, about diesel spillages. I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, on only one thing, when he compared diesel spillages with snow and ice. The situation is very different. In general, authorities know when it has snowed or when the temperature means the possibility of ice; diesel spillages, graphically described in all their horror, are not predictable in any way.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para5"></a>Local authorities already have a responsibility for the safety of highways. While dealing with such spillages and working with the emergency services would be part of the contingency planning that would be discussed in the guidance, it would not be appropriate to include a requirement on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para6"></a>Given the absolute assurance that we understand precisely the problems that have been raised this afternoon and the need to deal with them, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I am very grateful for all the support I have had, especially from my noble friend Lord Goschen, although he was not quite so helpful <P>


<a name="column_88"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>when mentioning my famous past on horses. I am also grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Berkeley and Lord Faulkner.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para7"></a>I am grateful for the Minister's sympathy and for saying that this matter has to be dealt with. However, if we remember what has happened in the past with ice and snow on our roads&#151;snow, in particular&#151;perhaps I am not wrong in saying that when it snows we are always told that it was not expected. That is why we have these great traffic jams, with people unable to go to work. So perhaps the situation is not so dissimilar to that of diesel spillages.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para8"></a>Perhaps the Minister could give us some insight into the timing of the consultation. Might we also have an insight into the guidance before we reach Third Reading?

<P>
<A NAME="40427-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, I think, in the interests of accuracy and credit, it was not I who supported the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, but my noble friend Lord Simon. Had I spoken, I would have been delighted to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-29_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I have a number of questions about Clause 19. Clause 19(1) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The appropriate national authority may direct a local traffic authority to provide it . . .  with specified information".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-29_para13"></a>
Will the noble Lord give me some clarification? Does "appropriate national authority" mean the Department for Transport or the Highways Agency?
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para14"></a>Overall, the clause would have been unnecessary if the Minister had accepted my earlier amendment, which would have required local authorities to publish their plans. If they were to publish their plans, the Secretary of State might not require all that information. The Minister spoke about reducing the burden on local government, but Clause 19 could be used to increase it.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para15"></a>Will the Minister confirm that the power given by Clause 19 will be used only to establish whether the criteria for making intervention orders under Clause 27 are being followed? I assume that the power to require information relates purely to possible intervention notices rather than to any general traffic duties. It would be helpful if the Minister were to confirm that or to tell me that I am wrong.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para16"></a>Clause 19(4) states that a direction given to a London authority must be copied to the Mayor. Under this clause can a direction be given to Transport for London or is there any part of the Bill where TfL can be included? I presume that if a London borough were given an intervention order, circumstances could arise where its local transport plan is affected by a strategic road operated by Transport for London that goes through it. In considering whether to make an intervention order, will the Secretary of State have the power to acquire similar information from TfL to enable him to decide whether it would be necessary or not?
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para17"></a>Wide powers are being given in terms of direction, so it is important that we establish that they will be used only by the Secretary of State to ascertain whether an intervention order or notice is necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-29_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   I return to a point that I made earlier. What is the point of gathering all the information in Clause 19(1) if it is not to be used in a useful way? Otherwise, a lot of people's time will be wasted. That point has just been made. We have a chance to enable government services to make life much more efficient for people. If there is a website that enables all the disrupters of traffic&#151;be they private companies, local authorities or government bodies&#151;to co-operate, that will be a good and successful model which could easily be copied. Such a model is used in my native country, Scotland. As I have mentioned previously, the Scottish Executive has appointed Susiephone Limited as the "Keeper of the Scottish Road Works Register". People can visit that website, register and find out what is going on. I was asked earlier who Susie was. It appears to be Robert Scotson.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-29_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   This clause provides a power to collect specified information relating to the performance of the duty. The DfT will look to existing monitoring arrangements wherever possible. However, with such a complex issue it would be unfair to judge authorities on the basis of, say, one source of data. Without a transport inspectorate, a full picture would be available only with the judicious use of an information-gathering power.
<P>

<a name="40427-29_para18"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, asked about the appropriate national authorities. They are the Secretary of State in England and the National Assembly for Wales. The prime purpose of Clause 19 is to find out information before initiating formal interventions&#151;I hope that the noble Viscount is reassured by that. He also asked whether subsection (4), which refers to directions given to London boroughs being copied to TfL, rules out directives issued to TfL. The answer is, no, as a whole, it does not allow a direction to be given to TfL. I hope that that answers the question.

Is there anywhere in the Bill for the Secretary of State to exercise a power over TfL similar to that relating to local authorities if he felt it necessary to require information from it that related to other information that he required from a borough?
<P>

Would the words "Transport for London" not be better than "the Mayor"? Perhaps the department would consider that, but, meanwhile, I am grateful for the Minister's response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-30_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 76A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 19, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-30_para3"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "TRAFFIC LIGHTS
<br>
(1) In exercising their network management duty, a local traffic authority (or, in London, the Transport Operational Command Unit) shall be required to monitor all traffic lights in operation in their area and shall&#151;
<br>
(a) ensure all traffic lights operate on a sensitive basis during non-rush hour periods;
<br>
(b) require that traffic lights are set to achieve the most expedious flow of traffic and pedestrians at all times they are operational;
<br>
(c) require that unless there are good reasons for not doing so that traffic lights at junctions with low traffic volumes operate in amber warning mode in all directions during non-rush hour periods."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-30_para4"></a>The noble Viscount said: This is a traffic light amendment. It seeks to be helpful and to introduce traffic lights that are responsive to the flow of traffic on our roads. Traditional traffic lights are responsible for reducing the flow of traffic in many cases, causing congestion, driver irritation, pollution and damaging competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="40427-30_para5"></a>The London Chamber of Commerce says that congestion is costing business over 3 million a day and conditions are getting worse. Business analysts in London have pointed out that the jams are not being caused by more vehicles coming into London, because the AA's figures suggest that there are fewer cars in central London than there were 20 years ago. However, there has been a sharp increase in the number of traffic lights and in some parts of central London they are now only 80 yards apart. In addition, the timing of some of the traffic lights has been altered to slow the traffic even further.
<P>


<a name="column_91"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 91</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-30_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, who is not in his place, would of course say that that was to allow pedestrians the ease to cross the road. But in some cases one can wait quite a long time when there do not seem to be any pedestrians. So the amendment says that wherever new traffic lights are installed or old ones refurbished, there should be a requirement on those responsible to install traffic lights that can operate on a traffic-sensitive basis.
<P>

<a name="40427-30_para7"></a>Paragraph (c) of my amendment follows the suggestion made in another place that traffic lights which control low-density traffic could be set to a flashing amber in all directions at non-rush hour periods, signalling to motorists from all directions to cross the junction with care. That has been tried and tested in America and works quite well in certain places, although not many people walk in America, so the case remains to be proved. When the matter was debated in Standing Committee, my honourable friend in another place asked whether the Government would consider introducing a pilot scheme. The Minister, Mr McNulty, said that the Government were not particularly interested in doing that, but added:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We would not dismiss such a scheme out of hand if local authorities reflected on it, decided that they might want to entertain it, and worked up a scheme that we could seriously entertain".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-30_para8"></a>
Further on, he said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"but if local authorities decide to proceed with the proposal, work it up, and reflect on it, we will consider it subsequently&#151;but without any promise of endorsing it, running a pilot on an experimental basis or otherwise".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee A, 10/2/04; cols. 341&#150;42.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-30_para9"></a>
That was a helpful answer. So when the Minister deals with paragraph (c), will he help by saying that if a local authority wished to try a pilot&#151;and none of us knows how well that would work in this country&#151;would it have the power to do so, or would additional powers be required? If that was the case, paragraph (c) of my amendment would be unnecessary. The important part of my amendment is to ensure that traffic lights operate on a sensitive basis so that they improve the flow of traffic and allow for pedestrians to cross the road without creating further jams. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-30_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   My point is not quite covered by the amendment but I find it dangerous, when traffic lights for temporary road works are removed, that the signs for them are left out. I find that that happens more often than it should. One eventually comes to disregard such signs, as one knows that around the corner there are no traffic lights. That is dangerous and it should be a basic principle that people should be fined if they leave warning signs out when there is no longer a hazard because motorists will start ignoring hazard signs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I rise, perhaps rudely, to remind noble Lords about traffic-sensitive lights. I do not know whether anyone else has had the misfortune to travel down the road past the Albert Hall on the left-hand side. As one approaches the junction with Queensgate the traffic lights there are some of the <P>


<a name="column_92"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 92</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>worst in London. They allow bicycles to come out of the park&#151;and that is right&#151;but the park is closed, depending on the season, at, say, 6 p.m. So, every time one approaches the lights after that time no bicycles come out, but all the traffic is stopped, while the green light is lit to let non-existent bicycles cross. If this amendment were passed those sort of errors would be eliminated and I am sure that traffic would move much faster.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   As the Committee has heard, Amendment No. 76A would extend the network management duty of local traffic authorities to monitor all traffic lights. In London, traffic lights are the responsibility of TfL and not of the "Transport Operational Command Unit" as the amendment states&#151;a minor correction.
<P>

<a name="40427-30_para10"></a>One strand of a local traffic authority's activities relevant to the network management duty in Clause 16 will be to ensure that traffic light settings are working correctly in order to achieve the expeditious movement of all traffic. "Traffic" explicitly includes pedestrians. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="40427-30_para11"></a>The proposed new clause would require traffic authorities to ensure that all traffic lights were set to the optimum settings at all times they are operational. We agree with that general objective, but not with the means. The majority of traffic lights in the UK allocate green times in proportion to the flow of vehicles and the needs of pedestrians. They are set to be responsive to changes in traffic flow. To achieve the most expeditious and safe passage of vehicles and pedestrian traffic, the lights can also have different settings to cater for both rush hour and non-rush hour periods. We will include advice on that, in practice covering the aims of proposed subsections (a) and (b), in the section of network management duty guidance which is entitled "Good Practice Advice On Techniques And Approach". There is therefore no need to include the requirement in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40427-30_para12"></a>However, as the Committee has heard from the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, the proposed new clause would further require traffic lights during non-rush hour times to operate on flashing amber warning mode at junctions with low traffic volumes. The proposal would seriously compromise vehicular and pedestrian safety. Flashing amber already has a specific meaning on pelican crossings; that is, that a driver may proceed if no pedestrians are crossing. The amendment would mean that flashing amber would be used not only at pelican crossings but also at approaches to junctions controlled by traffic lights. That would cause danger and confusion.
<P>

<a name="40427-30_para13"></a>The long-established practice in the UK is to signal pedestrians to cross at junctions only when there are no conflicting vehicle movements. If flashing amber signals are used at junctions, it will not be possible to ensure that conflicting movements are stopped. Pedestrian signals would therefore have to be turned off. That would be a problem particularly for blind and partially sighted pedestrians who rely on audible and tactile signals to indicate when it is safe to cross at many junctions. Therefore, pedestrians&#151;especially the most vulnerable&#151;<P>


<a name="column_93"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 93</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would have no crossing facilities and they would find crossing the road neither convenient nor safe at non-rush hour times. In addition, flashing amber would not in any case be suitable at many junctions where buildings or road lay-out prevents drivers seeing whether other vehicles are approaching the junction.
<P>

<a name="40427-30_para14"></a>A better solution would be to ensure that signals operate, wherever possible, in a responsive way; for example, drivers would be stopped only when there is a conflict with other vehicle or pedestrian movements. Furthermore, at quiet times, a signal need only stop traffic if a pedestrian has activated it. With the advance of new technology, the way in which traffic lights are operated will become more and more sophisticated.

He might find it helpful to know that on our visit to the London Traffic Control Centre we saw that 2,800 of the 4,800 sets of traffic lights in London can now be operated by intervention from the centre. They are now under computer control. The advance in technology to which my noble friend referred is happening apace.

The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, asked whether it was possible for a local authority to experiment or have a pilot scheme with flashing amber lights. I have made the Government's position clear but the local authority would have to obtain permission from the department before proceeding. No new primary power would be needed for flashing amber, although regulations would need to be revised.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para0"></a>Of course, we agree with the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, that tidying up signs is very good practice and just the kind of thing that will be encouraged by the guidance that we shall publish on network management.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40427-31_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 77, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 78 and 79. Before I do so, I thank the Minister for his advice about writing to TfL. I am glad to say that I do not think his remark has fallen on deaf ears because I understand that there has been some communication in that direction already.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para7"></a>The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the independence and local accountability of traffic authorities are not overlooked. Clause 20 refers to the timetable for intervention notices. As it stands, it is contrary to central and local government agreements to give local authorities more local freedom and flexibilities. The Local Government Association has articulated its desire for clarification over the exact circumstances in which intervention would take place and for how long the intervention would be maintained.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para8"></a>A basic tenet of local authority accountability is surely that matters of local traffic management are the remit of the electors and their elected councillors. Much more substantive evidence must be specified for an authority to have been declared a failure. Timetables will need to be written into any primary legislation to ensure that authorities are treated evenly and fairly and that they are given time to comply and submit evidence.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para9"></a>In the other place, a recent Select Committee report on the Bill made it emphatically clear that the Government's intentions should be plainly set out in draft guidance prior to the Bill progressing through both Houses. It also urged that considerably more information than is currently given in the Bill be sought on how the intervention powers will be operated.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para10"></a>The Select Committee report expressed its hope that intervention would take place only in extreme cases. In spite of ministerial assurances on that, clear expressions of this sentiment on the face of the Bill are noticeably absent. Will the Minister comment particularly on that?
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para11"></a>In order to reassure the many concerned parties, will the Minister, who is spokesman for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, confirm that the intervention mechanisms in the Bill are in line with the protocol on interventions agreed between the ODPM and the LGA? The amendments would demand a detailed minimum timetable before any intervention notice can be issued and an external director can be imposed. The notion of "reasonable notice", as stated in Clause 21(4)(a), is insufficient,
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para12"></a>As it stands, Clause 21 gives the Secretary of State open ended powers to intervene whenever he thinks it is reasonable to do so. In the Transport Act 2000 local <P>


<a name="column_95"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authorities were given powers to intervene in bus operations, a key element of local transport plans. But this Bill sets out a precise minimum timetable before intervention can take place. Also contained in the legislation is an appeal mechanism so that the rationality of interventions can be tested. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-31_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   I support the amendment, both in spirit and detail, because this is, in principle, one of the most worrying parts of the Bill for two reasons. First&#151;and I declare an interest as chair of the Local Government Association Transport Executive&#151;it seems to local authorities that there is a disconnection between the work that is coming out of the ODPM, which is about allowing local authorities much more freedom and flexibility in what they choose to do, and the work of the Department for Transport, which proposes another intervention power. That is a principle which we breach at our peril.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para13"></a>The second difficulty that I have, which follows on from that, is that if the Government intend to do something as draconian as intervening in the work of a local highways authority, the circumstances in which they feel they should do that must be more clearly laid out than on the face of the Bill. In other areas, for example social services, where government intervenes when an authority is not performing properly, the circumstances in which that happens are clear and well defined. The Bill contains simply one paragraph and uses words such as "considers", "may be failing" and "is of the opinion that". Those are woolly terms for something as dramatic as imposing an intervention order on a local authority.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para14"></a>I have now had an opportunity since we last met to look at the brief guidance issued by the department on the criteria for intervention. In a sense, it has left me even more perplexed because it covers a list of the types of matters that the guidance on the criteria will cover. I shall not delay the Committee by listing them, but these are issues that are covered either through the local transport planning process, which is an already fairly well developed bureaucracy, or that are so strategic in nature that they are well covered for the local authorities by the comprehensive performance assessment, to which my noble friend Lord Bradshaw referred.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para15"></a>So, not only is there a potential intervention, but this clearly works against the spirit that the Minister mentioned at the start of today's proceedings about reducing the regulatory and inspection burden on local authorities. An extra level of that is now to be imposed on them. All in all, I am extremely concerned about Clause 20, both in principle and as it appears on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-31_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Amendment No. 77 seeks to change the requirement upon the appropriate national authority when issuing an intervention notice. Clause 20(2)(a) currently provides that a notice must include brief particulars of the grounds for giving the notice&#151;a point picked up by the noble Baroness, Lady Scott.
<P>


<a name="column_96"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para16"></a>The amendment would require detailed particulars of the grounds for issuing the intervention notice in terms of both the nature and the duration of failure in the context of local transport strategies. We consider that to be inappropriate. The intervention notice process is intended to allow the appropriate national authority formally to bring to the attention of an LTA any concerns that there may be about performance against any of the network management duties. At that stage, the Secretary of State would not have prejudged the question of whether the authority was failing. Therefore, it is only right and proper that it has the opportunity to put its side of the case.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para17"></a>To achieve most benefit from the process, it is clearly in the interest of the appropriate national authority to set out the reasons for issuing the notice. However, as full details would not necessarily be available at that stage, it would be unsuitable to make that a requirement in every case.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para18"></a>Amendment No. 78 would add the requirement that the specified period that the authority would have to respond to the notice could be no shorter than one year. Amendment No. 79 is intended to prevent the appropriate national authority proceeding with intervention unless it has published information relating to the specific activities in which the local traffic authority has failed to meet the duty and provided the authority has been given no less than a year in order to give it time to improve. We believe that these amendments would prevent the option of taking prompt action in the event of failure.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para19"></a>Clause 21 already requires the appropriate national authority to set out a number of matters in the intervention order, including that the national authority should be satisfied that the local authority is failing properly to perform any duty under Clauses 16 and 17. Clause 21 also requires the order to set out brief particulars of the grounds for appointing a traffic director. As that would effectively be in the public domain, I see no added benefit in publishing it.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para20"></a>In practice, the Government are committed to giving local authorities every opportunity to take responsibility for their own problems and to implement the necessary solutions. Throughout the parliamentary process, we have repeated that intervention is very much a method of last resort. However, in cases where it was unavoidable, it would make no sense to apply arbitrary limits. That would prevent prompt action being taken to address the problems in an authority that was failing local road users.
<P>

<a name="40427-31_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, asked about the protocol relating to the LGA and the ODPM. The protocol on intervention allows for intervention without minimum periods passing, if warranted. The process in the Bill is consistent with the protocol. I hope that I have managed to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, that we are aware of the concerns that she has, and I hope that the amendments will be withdrawn following the explanation that I have given.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-32_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I have a number of questions relating to Clause 21, which makes provision for the appointment of a traffic director. There is new terminology: first, traffic managers, and now a traffic director. In effect, the clause gives the Secretary of State an open-ended power to intervene whenever he considers it reasonable to do so.
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para6"></a>I wonder whether the Minister has considered one aspect of this issue. Other legislation&#151;for example, the Transport Act 2000&#151;gives local authorities the power to intervene in bus operations, which is another key element of the local transport plan. It sets out a precise minimum timetable before an intervention can take place, and an appeal mechanism is included so that the reasonableness of the interventions can be tested.
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para7"></a>Clause 20(2)(b) provides the opportunity for representations to be made. However, my real question is: under Clause 21, is there any process for an appeals mechanism when the Secretary of State has decided that a traffic director should be appointed under the clause?
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para8"></a>I also presume that once the traffic director is appointed&#151;as we can see, he will have considerable powers&#151;he can intervene in the activities of a local traffic authority. I should like an assurance, which I am sure the Minister will give me, that he must operate within the national guidance because presumably he will come from either the Highways Agency or the Department for Transport. I wonder whether the Minister has considered what type of person the traffic director could be. He will have substantial powers. Clause 21(7)(b) states that the order may,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"confer ancillary powers on the traffic director",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-32_para9"></a>
and that is further described in subsection (8). It would be helpful if the Minister could give a little comfort on those points.
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para10"></a>I fully accept that the powers are those of last resort and that the Government do not intend to use them very often. However, if they are used, it is important <P>


<a name="column_98"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 98</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that they are used in an equitable manner. I wonder whether the Minister can help me, particularly on the point about appeals to intervention orders.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Clause 21 allows intervention through the appointment of a traffic director. That is achieved by making an intervention order which sets out the grounds for intervention and the objectives of the traffic director and allows any powers considered appropriate by the appropriate national authority to secure the duty to be conferred upon him. I believe that that answers one of the noble Viscount's points in that the national authority determines the scope of activity of the traffic director. The traffic director does not have powers that he or she can pluck out of the air when at work.
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para11"></a>The power to intervene if an authority is failing is vital if we are to ensure that all authorities meet their duty. The Bill deliberately allows a flexible, proportionate approach in seeking to confer only the powers needed in any given circumstance. Different levels of intervention will be possible: at one level, monitoring and intervening only when necessary; and, at the other extreme, taking over some of an authority's functions or powers. It has the safeguard of preventing intervention unless an intervention notice has been given and the specified period set by that document has passed.
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para12"></a>It is only prudent for the national authority to take the power to intervene if an authority is failing. This clause provides the means for the national authority to take prompt and proportionate action in cases where an authority is neglecting its duty.
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para13"></a>As I said in response to the previous debate, the principle of prompt intervention is not unprecedented. On the question of appeal, the process set out under Clause 20 gives the local authority the opportunity to put its side of the case prior to intervention. With those explanations, I hope that we can agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I have listened with some incredulity. This provision strikes me as being the real sledgehammer to crack the proverbial nut. If a local authority is failing in its duty to manage its highway network properly, and it is so obvious that that is the case that it comes to the notice of the national authority&#151;that will not happen very quickly&#151;I should have thought that, by then, it might have come to the notice of the local electorate, who have it in their hands to take effective steps by stopping the local authority managing the traffic. That is the kind of power that I personally do not wish to see given to the national authority.

<a name="40427-32_para14"></a>There are means of examining the traffic management plans of an authority, and the Government have the opportunity to comment on them.

<FONT SIZE=3>its nature. I am sorry but if, on Report, the noble Viscount cares to move an amendment, I shall be very inclined to support him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   Perhaps I may quickly ask my noble friend a question. Under what circumstances could intervention orders be made? Let us suppose that Barnet, for example, was a traffic authority and that it had removed its bus lanes on a road which came within the ambit of its responsibilities. A political football-type situation could easily arise because Barnet is a Conservative authority and our present Government are Labour. The Government could say, "You are not complying with our rules and therefore we are going to remove your traffic responsibilities". Can my noble friend give one or two examples of how that could happen?
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para15"></a>I also share some of the concerns voiced by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. If we ever have regional government in this country, responsibilities will be devolved. Personally I would consider that to be a good thing, having spent part of last week in Scotland where the transport policies seem to be excellent. However, this measure seems to be going in the other direction, with more centralist control. I am not sure what the benefits of that are, but I am sure that my noble friend can persuade me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-32_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Before the Minister replies, I shall give him the chance to consider with care the information which is no doubt about to arrive over his right shoulder. Perhaps I can answer the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. If he cares to draft an amendment, I shall view it very carefully.
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para16"></a>The point made by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, is important. This is a very centralising Bill&#151;it centralises traffic management. In some cases, that is a good thing; in others, it is bad. We are giving the Secretary of State very large powers here. When I asked the Minister about appeals, he said, rightly, that under Clause 20 local traffic authorities can make representations about an intervention notice. But my point was that, so far as I can see, it cannot appeal against an intervention order. Presumably, it can do so only through the use of judicial review, which, as we know, is time-consuming, lengthy, difficult and expensive and, indeed, when the Secretary of State's powers are so wide, there may not be a very good chance of success.
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para17"></a>Therefore, it seems to me that&#151;perhaps the Minister will confirm that I have this right&#151;once an order is given, there is no power for a local authority to appeal the order. I should like clarification on that matter while the Minister answers the other points raised by the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I shall attempt to answer the questions raised. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, we want to work with authorities to improve their performance rather than having to intervene and, to borrow the noble Lord's phrase, use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. However, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>if everything else fails, we need the ability to intervene and that is why the power is in the Bill. This is not a Stalinseque Bill or a great centralising document.
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para18"></a>Before the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, rises, perhaps I may finish my comments. Throughout the Bill we talk about consultation. We have consulted on the very thing that the noble Lord described as Stalinesque. The LGA has accepted the wider principle that intervention is necessary in the event of failure. That is why it has signed up to the ODPM/LGA protocol. These arrangements are absolutely consistent.
<P>

<a name="40427-32_para19"></a>With regard to the final point raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, the authority could go to judicial review on an intervention order if it did not like it. As we have explained, the appeal, or discussion, comes before an intervention order is issued.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   It seems to me that a local authority which displeases a government significantly by failing to carry out any service is able to be brought to book by the hold which that government have on both its revenue and its capital expenditure. If my own local authority greatly displeased the Government by withholding both capital approval and revenue grant, the Government could bring us to our knees very quickly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   If the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, does not mind my saying so, that really is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Is the noble Lord suggesting that if there are serious problems with traffic management, central government should freeze or withdraw the grant to that local authority?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I am saying that local authority expenditure is so finely balanced that if an authority consistently displeased the government in any area&#151;in education, social healthcare, traffic or anything else&#151;simply by not funding a particular part of the work of the local authority, or by not funding it generously, the displeasure would be felt and would be taken notice of by the councillors and the chief executive. I believe that the powers sought here are completely unnecessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I hesitate to intervene in this discussion, but I should have thought that the Minister was right to say that the procedures suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, are more drastic than the very specific ones, ad hoc for a particular purpose, set out in the Bill. As all actions of government can be judicially challenged, I should have thought that interventions of the kind that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, mentioned might readily be found by the courts to be disproportionate to the problem that has arisen. I assume that the problem is that a local authority has fallen down on its specific job of traffic management. I should have thought that a specific remedy dealing with that, including the appointment of a traffic director by the national authority, would be better than the indirect, blunderbuss approach of depriving the local authority of its finances.

<A NAME="40427-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   That may be the lawyer's approach to this matter; it is not, in reality, the truth. In reality, every local authority is extremely mindful of the local government settlement, which is due at around Christmas time. The Government make their pleasure or displeasure very keenly felt simply by withholding capital approvals from schemes. I am sorry but I do not like the dirigiste system set down in the Bill. I believe that most of the time most local authorities try, to the best of their ability, to do what central government want.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-33_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 81:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 10, line 42, leave out "may be revoked by that national authority" and insert "shall be revoked not later than six months after commencement unless a new order is made in accordance with the provisions set out in section 20 and 21"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-33_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40427-33_para3"></a>The noble Viscount said: Clause 22 is called by the exciting title, "Appointment of traffic director: supplementary", and includes the words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where by virtue of an intervention order a traffic director is to be appointed in relation to a local traffic authority . . .  any person (including the national authority making the order, another local traffic authority, a Passenger Transport Executive or any other public authority) may be appointed . . .  the appointment may be made on such terms as that national authority may consider appropriate; and . . .  the appointment may be revoked by that national authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-33_para4"></a>
I think that I understand that but I am not entirely sure what it means. Therefore, I have tabled two brief amendments, which I hope will give the Minister a chance to explain what it means to a simple soul such as myself. My amendments also seek to ensure that the traffic director will have a duty to follow, or take account of, the wider transport and environmental policies of the relevant authority, as set out in the local transport plan.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para5"></a>Amendment No. 82 inserts a maximum period for intervention or for an object mechanism to renew the intervention. The clause appears to give the director powers to direct authorities to take a narrow traffic management approach to local integrated transport policies. The importance of these wider policies and duties must be acknowledged, and we believe that it might be helpful if they were written into the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para6"></a>The Bill gives the national authority open-ended powers to replace local traffic authorities with imposed directives. Therefore, there must be clear provisions in the Bill for ending any imposition and returning control to a local authority. I believe it is important that if we reach the stage where a traffic director is imposed on a local authority, we must have a clear understanding from the Government that, as well as simply carrying out pure traffic management, the director will take account of the wider problems that relate to traffic in that local area. That is the basis of my amendment.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para7"></a>To some extent, through the amendments I am also trying to gain a commitment from the Government that, if such an appointment takes place, it will be <P>


<a name="column_102"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>either for a specified period of time or to deal with particular problems, and that the Government will say, "This is the reason we are doing it. When we have solved that problem, we might be prepared to hand back control to the local authority". I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   Very briefly, the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, has raised an interesting point. Clause 16(1) states that it is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the duty of a local traffic authority to manage the road network . . .  so far as may be reasonably practicable having regard to their other obligations, policies and objectives". Those are the obligations, policies and objectives that we talked about during our first day in Grand Committee. Must the traffic director who is to be appointed by the Government still comply with the same obligations, policies and objectives of the authority as the original one who, presumably in the view of the Government, would have failed to have done so?

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40427-33_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   As we have heard, Amendment No. 81 puts a time limit of six months on the appointment of a traffic director and, in effect, on the intervention in an authority. This would mean that the procedures set out in Clauses 20 and 21 would have to be followed if an appointment was to continue. Among other things, that would require formal information gathering in Clause 20 to be continually repeated. This would be despite the fact that the traffic director would already be in place and well positioned to provide or request that without the need for an intervention notice.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para8"></a>We believe that that would place a real burden on the authority and lead to an overly bureaucratic process of constant renewal. The process set out in the Bill of ongoing monitoring with a planned exit strategy at an appropriate time offers a more efficient solution. Clearly there is no benefit in the appropriate national authority retaining a traffic director any longer than is absolutely necessary. However, we would not wish to disengage before it was right to do so.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para9"></a>If circumstances meant that a longer period of time was necessary to reach the position where an authority could resume the network management role itself, we would not want to be constrained by an arbitrary time limit. Amendment No. 82 requires the traffic director to take account of the local authority's local transport plan and is also intended to prevent the traffic director acting in conflict with the plan. That answers one of the points raised in our brief discussion.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para10"></a>The network management duty already includes reference to the local traffic authority having regard to its other obligations, policies and objectives in Clause 16. The local transport plan will contain such policies. The powers that can be granted to the traffic director must relate to the objectives set out in the intervention order&#151;no more, no less. By virtue of Clauses 21 and 22, the objectives are linked to the duty in Clause 16&#151;that is, they are limited to things that would secure that the duty was properly performed. Again, I hope that that will reassure the noble Viscount, Lord Astor.
<P>


<a name="column_103"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para11"></a>Those objectives may or may not conflict with the objectives of the LTP. That does not mean that a traffic director would not take into account the policies in the decisions or actions that he took if they were relevant to his objectives.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para12"></a>Turning to a point made by my noble friend Lord Berkeley, the traffic director is covered by the same duty in Clause 16. Therefore, he would have to take account of the same duties and obligations as the authority. That reinforces the point that I have just made. I hope that, with that explanation, the amendment can be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-33_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I believe that he has, indeed, covered the point that I raised and I shall of course study carefully what has been said. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40427-33_para19"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving Amendment No. 83 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 84 to 88.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para20"></a>These are probing amendments to ascertain the powers relating to the traffic director. Clauses 24 and 25 seem to imply that the director can intervene in the delivery of powers which are not traffic management and they give him powers of direction over wider council priorities. For example, he could direct that a light rail scheme could not be proceeded with because it would cause short-term traffic disruption, that school opening hours must be changed, or that environmental traffic bans should be overturned. I do not believe that that is the Government's intention. However, I wonder whether the clause does not need to be tightened up to ensure that that could not happen.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para21"></a>The House of Commons Transport Select Committee report on the Bill expresses concern that the Bill as drafted will give too much weight to traffic management duties when balanced against wider integrated transport policies and other non-transport duties of local authorities. For example, delivery of local bus strategies may require redirection of available road capacity, and the traffic director should not have unlimited powers to overrule the objectives of such a strategy.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para22"></a>The later amendments deal with provisions that seem to make the relevant local authority legally responsible for the actions of an imposed traffic director, even in circumstances where they are obliged by the terms of the Bill to implement policies with which they perhaps disagree. For example, if a traffic director were instructed, perhaps not unreasonably, to remove traffic-calming measures and a subsequent road traffic death occurred which led to legal action, the authority could <P>


<a name="column_104"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suffer the penalties arising from an action over which it had no control. When a traffic director is imposed he or she must be legally responsible for his or her actions as an agent of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40427-33_para23"></a>I wonder whether the Minister might consider those points as he addresses these clauses and amendments. There are some important issues here. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Amendments Nos. 83 and 86 aim to limit the powers of intervention in the activities of a local traffic authority that may be granted to the traffic director to only those conferred on the local authority in its capacity as a traffic, highway or transport authority. The purpose of the network management duty is to make authorities consider all the elements that contribute to the operation of the road networks. Limiting it in the way that the amendment intends would be counterproductive.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para0"></a>There are plenty of things for which a local authority is responsible that could have a serious impact upon the network. Waste management, for example, may not readily spring to mind, but refuse vehicles regularly collecting from narrow busy streets in rush hour are just the sort of thing that road users would justifiably expect to be considered and, if at all possible, avoided. To meet the duty a local authority would need to adopt a coherent approach across the whole organisation. If an authority was failing to meet the duty, especially if that was due to individual departments working independently, then clearly the traffic director would need the powers to address it.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para1"></a>Amendments Nos. 84 and 87 would not allow the intervention order to confer powers on the traffic director to intervene or exercise functions if those took precedence over other statutory powers and duties of the authority.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para2"></a>In making decisions, the traffic director would need to take into account other duties of the authority as the network management duty requires in Clause 16. They would not be operating in a vacuum. Therefore, other duties and powers such as safety must be part of the considerations. Inevitably, the traffic director may take different decisions from the authority. The fact that he is there at all implies that the authority's previous decisions or actions were not enough. But this is a question of taking a different approach to the balance of duties and powers, not overriding them. Therefore, to pre-define precedence of one duty over another we believe would be unnecessarily constraining.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para3"></a>Amendments Nos. 85 and 88 would remove provisions which provide that things done by the traffic director are to be treated as having been done by the authority. These provisions are required so that any things done by the traffic director in pursuance of the powers conferred by the intervention order are treated and continue to be treated as a thing done by the traffic authority. The acts of the traffic director should not be subject to fruitless argument, either during or after intervention, as to whether persons are or were acting in accordance with the requirements imposed by the traffic director or the authority.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para4"></a>Fears that the traffic director would in some way not be accountable are completely unfounded. He would have to exercise the powers conferred on him with the aim of fulfilling the objectives in the intervention order, which relates back to ensuring that the local traffic authority discharges its network management duty.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para5"></a>Furthermore, accountability is secured as a principle as a traffic director could be subject to judicial review depending on the circumstances of the case. We believe, therefore, that important safeguards already exist. I very much hope, with the assurance I have been able to give, that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<a name="40427-34_para14"></a>The noble Viscount said: Again, this is a probing amendment to ascertain the Minister's and the Government's views on where two or more local authorities are affected by an intervention order. Where they may be working jointly, we want to ensure that should one of them not be working and require an intervention order, that does not automatically mean that the other is also included.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para15"></a>As the Bill is drafted, that could mean&#151;I may be wrong and would be grateful for the information&#151;that it could lead to the powers of a good authority in effect being given to an external director. That does not seem to be fair or intentional. The amendment states effectively that that would be possible jointly only where there is a formal, binding, working agreement in place. If that were the case, we think that it is acceptable for the traffic director to be able to intervene. But we need a little help on the arrangements for joint activities.

<a name="40427-34_para16"></a>I understand that this may be an issue which is subject to guidance. If that is the case, I should welcome advice from the Government as to when we shall see it and, indeed, when consultations on the guidance will start. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   There will be some occasions, probably fairly limited, on which authorities will exercise functions jointly. Where that occurs, it is appropriate to allow the national authority to intervene where the exercise of those joint functions contributes to the failure of the authorities to meet their network management duties under Clauses 16 and 17.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para17"></a>The first part of Amendment No. 89, by leaving out "to any extent" in reference to the performance of the duty, would mean that intervention could take place only where each and every aspect affecting the duty was covered by the joint arrangements. That is a very unlikely situation, so the effect of the amendment could be to prevent intervention in circumstances where that was properly required. We believe that to be far too restrictive. For functions and duties to be jointly exercised, there would necessarily have to be a clearly ascertainable agreement between the authorities concerned.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para18"></a>Moving on to line 26, where part of the performance of the network management duty is exercised jointly with another authority, and that function&#151;or functions&#151;is clearly part of the reason for the failure of an authority in its duty, there needs to be scope for the national authority to intervene.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para19"></a>Amendment No. 90 seeks to limit intervention to where the authorities which were working jointly were all failing in their duty. If the joint functions were so critical to the duty, it is most likely that all the authorities will be similarly affected: they will succeed or fail together. But since, in the situations covered by this clause, authorities are jointly responsible, any intervention necessarily has to include all the authorities by virtue of the joint arrangements. However, intervention would be tailored to address the problems identified in the intervention process. It is not the Government's intention to be intervening in authorities that are performing their duties effectively. That refers to a point raised earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para20"></a>Orders under this clause will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, so there will be a further opportunity for noble Lords to look at the detailed proposals. In answer to a point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, it needs a statutory instrument, rather than guidance, to put Clause 26 into effect. So, there is parliamentary scrutiny.

<a name="40427-34_para28"></a>The committee did not take the view that it was inappropriate that the exercise of these powers of intervention in individual cases was a matter over which Parliament did not retain control. However, the committee recommended that the guidance on criteria for intervention in Clause 27 should be subject to parliamentary procedure.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para29"></a>The Department for Transport is currently working with key stakeholders from local government and road user representatives on the development of this guidance. As part of that work we shall also be putting the guidance on criteria out to public consultation within the next few months. With that process in place, I am confident that the guidance will prove to be both reasonable and effective. However, the Government recognise the significance of the committee's recommendation and have therefore tabled the amendment to meet its wishes.
<P>

<a name="40427-34_para30"></a>This would require the guidance under Clause 27 to be appended to an order. In relation to England, the order would be subject to negative resolution in both Houses. In relation to Wales, the order would be subject to the Assembly's procedures. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40427-35_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I do not know whether this would be helpful to the Committee. I suggested earlier&#151;I do not know whether the Minister got the message&#151;that I would be happy to group my Amendments Nos. 91 and 92 with this amendment, so that the Minister can speak to them now. However, if not, I am happy to leave them as they are grouped.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I shall be delighted to speak to Amendments Nos. 91 and 92.
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para0"></a>Amendment No. 91 seeks to write on to the face of the Bill that the guidance on criteria for intervention shall specify minimum times over which the criteria will apply. I can agree with the principle that intervention should not be based on isolated incidents or short experience. As I have said many times today, intervention is intended as a last resort, as Ministers have made clear in another place, for situations where there is a systematic failure in an authority meeting its <P>


<a name="column_108"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 108</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>network management duty. So the need to obtain evidence over a period of time will be covered in the guidance on criteria.
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para1"></a>However, that does not need to be on the face of the Bill. There may need to be some flexibility for different circumstances, which the amendment would unnecessarily constrain. Also, this would be the only aspect of the guidance to be specified in the Bill, which could raise a question as to the status of other aspects. That we believe would be unhelpful.
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para2"></a>Amendment No. 92 would require guidance on the criteria for intervention to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in Parliament. As I have stated, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended that the guidance under Clause 27 should be subject to a Parliamentary process. The Government have accepted that recommendation and, as we have just shown, have brought forward their own amendment that would provide for parliamentary scrutiny through the negative resolution procedure. We consider that to be appropriate for this guidance.
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para3"></a>I hope that with the reassurance that the issue of obtaining evidence over time will be covered in the guidance, and taking into account the latter considerations about Amendment No. 92, the noble Viscount will not press his amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-35_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. We welcome his amendment, but we do have some concerns. I accept what the Minister says about Amendment No. 91 because I think that that is a fair point. However, in doing so, that makes the guidance more important and therefore requires scrutiny and, indeed, debate by Parliament. The negative instrument does not normally do that in either House, but the affirmative instrument does. As the guidance is so important and, as we have seen, it gives considerable powers to the traffic director and places a considerable burden on local authorities, I shall want to come back to it on Report. The affirmative procedure is important in this clause and in this area. I welcome the Government's amendments as far as they go, but we shall press the Minister to go a little further on Report.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para12"></a>The noble Viscount said: The amendment would remove powers to recover costs in all cases. A local authority may feel that it cannot deliver an integrated transport management function because of revenue spending shortfalls. The LGA has argued consistently that there is a shortfall in revenue spending for transport. That seems to have been accepted in principle by the Government. However, Clause 30 would mean not only that local authorities would have to spend more in order to report to the traffic director, but also that they would lose some of their existing income to pay for part of the director's activities. That will hardly result in better delivery of the targets set out in the Bill. Will the Minister outline what criteria will be used to consider,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such sum or sums as it may consider appropriate"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-35_para13"></a>
While the clause specifies that the amount recovered must not exceed the total expenditure of the national authority, it seems to leave it open to exceed the expenditure of the local authority. What checks and balances will be in place to ensure that the right to recover sums considered appropriate will not be abused? Is any help available to local authorities with financial problems, particularly if they have difficulty meeting the bill for the traffic director as required by the Bill? The amendment is again a probing one. It seeks a clearer understanding of how, in the event of a traffic director being appointed, the recovery system would work. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-35_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   This is another reason why this part of the Bill is objectionable. Local authorities are perpetually short of money. They are ground between the one millstone of the council tax and the other of the threat of capping. They do not often have a great deal of room to move. They also have to set priorities in their budget. Those priorities are usually education and healthcare in that order, with traffic becoming a low priority among their many obligations. Increasingly, we find that statutory duties are forced on local authorities and they have no option. That leads to non-statutory duties being even less well provided for.
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para14"></a>Again, I find this piece of legislation almost oppressive. As the noble Viscount said, the authority is in no position to spend money. There are just two relevant objectives. We have an objective to increase bus usage by passengers as part of the transport plan, but the cost of running bus services is rising so significantly that in parts of the county they are having to be cut substantially. One part of Government is saying, "Don't spend money". The other part is saying, "Do meet the criteria which we lay down", and the wretched authority may find itself being fined for not doing so, which will make its ability to meet criteria even weaker.
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para15"></a>I find this whole part of the Bill objectionable. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, raised several issues. I have not spoken on those because I think this part of the Bill is objectionable.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-35_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I worry about this, but for slightly different reasons. Listening to the debate on the past 10 or so clauses, it seems to me that with Clause 30 we shall end up with a kind of public sector receivership with the government, for whatever reason, being judge, jury and probably gaoler. I recall when Railtrack went into receivership. In my view, it thoroughly deserved it, but that is not the point. I think that the receivers' bill for entertainment was in six figures. There was no limit, it appears, as to how much they should spend. No doubt, six of them travelled to York first class at premium fare.
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para16"></a>If there is to be a recovery of the costs, it has to be reasonable. Given the way that the private sector becomes involved in some of these issues, who will control the costs? It seems to me that at present we have the Government imposing traffic directors, deciding how much those traffic directors will cost and getting it back from the local authorities even if they do not have the money, and, presumably, sending the members to gaol if they do not find the money. That worries me. If this has to be, and I do not like it very much, there will have to be limits on the rates and charges in this section.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-35_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Amendment No. 93 would remove the power for the national authority to recover any of the costs of a traffic director from a local traffic authority in which it had such an appointment. Obviously, it would negate the clause completely.
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para17"></a>We consider that it is reasonable for the national authority to recover costs from a local traffic authority where it has to intervene and appoint a traffic director. Clause 30(3) clearly places a cap on what the national authority could recover, including taking account of any costs met from other sources. But the exercise of the power in Clause 30 is a matter for the discretion of the national authority, which will have the flexibility to decide in each case whether it would be appropriate for the local traffic authority to bear some of the costs incurred by its failure to meet its network management duty.
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para18"></a>That approach is consistent with the costs of intervention where that occurs in other areas, and we consider it right to make this provision here also. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, make the same point: how can we stop power being abused? The power to recover money will not be abused. It is not in the interests of the Secretary of State to stop authorities getting up to scratch by taking away funds that they need in order to do so. That is why we have made it a discretionary power.
<P>

<a name="40427-35_para19"></a>In answer to a question raised by my noble friend Lord Berkeley, there are limits in the Bill on costs that can be recovered. As I mentioned, the Secretary of State is not required to recover costs. Given my assurances, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<a name="column_111"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>question. When we come to appoint a traffic director, that is fine, but when it comes to costs, will that traffic director arrive with an army of people&#151;a large team that will have to be paid for&#151;or will he be on his own? For all we know, he might arrive with his 40 mates from the department to come and sort it out. If that is the case, will they all have to be paid for? Are we talking about one man or can this be a body of people? It would be helpful if the Minister could answer that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I think it is fair to say that that depends very much on the circumstances. It depends on what manpower or womanpower is needed to solve the particular problem. There could be examples where that is just one person or a team&#151;a group of men or women. However, I assure the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that I fully understand the point that he makes. I am sure that the department will do precisely what is needed in the required circumstances.

We shall all have to hope that, as soon as the summer holidays appear, the department will not find that an area in the Lake District is failing in its traffic management and requires a large contingent to go there.

<a name="40427-36_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40427-36_para7"></a>The noble Viscount said: Having left traffic management and directors, we now move on to permit schemes in Part 3 of the Bill and enter an area just as complicated as the one that we have just left. My amendment is grouped with an amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, who will no doubt speak to that shortly.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para8"></a>Clause 32 is designed to ensure that permit schemes apply only to areas designated as "traffic sensitive" and that they are practical and balance the need to minimise congestion with the need to maintain and provide essential utility services.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para9"></a>My amendment focuses on areas where congestion is greatest. That would enable potentially greater impact without introducing an additional significant administrative burden on utilities and local authorities. If one were to apply permit schemes only to traffic-sensitive streets, that would have the advantage of avoiding unnecessary delays to work and would have a minimum impact on congestion by the virtue of being in a non-traffic-sensitive street. It would also minimise the administrative burden on both utilities and local authorities. It would enable there to be greater focus on managing areas where <P>


<a name="column_112"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>congestion is greatest. Indeed, it would alleviate fears that the permit system is designed to generate revenue rather than to improve co-ordination.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para10"></a>We welcome the Government's statement that it is not the intention of the permit scheme to raise revenue. The Minister in another place stated,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We must ensure that there is sufficient ability to charge for permits to pay for the scheme".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee A, 29/1/04; col. 163.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-36_para11"></a>
However, the way in which the permit scheme is introduced by the Bill remains of concern in relation to charges and to those who might be liable to such charges.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para12"></a>Perhaps I may take the matter further. If the permit scheme is not about raising revenue, why will the Government not impose a restriction on areas where permits will be required to undertake works, or limit the charges? Restricting the requirement for permits to traffic-sensitive streets would ensure that the scheme had maximum impact on congestion for the minimum amount of additional administration, again both for utilities and local authorities.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para13"></a>To require utilities to apply for a permit and local authorities to process a permit for works in back streets and other areas where there will be little or no impact on the flow of traffic will serve only to tie up all parties in red tape and bureaucracy, which will reduce the efficiency of the entire scheme. Focusing the permit scheme on traffic-sensitive areas would not only minimise the administration but would avoid unnecessary delays to vital work that does not impact on traffic. One should ensure that local authorities focus their efforts or there will be no benefit.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   It may be appropriate for me to speak on Amendments Nos. 96 and 97, which are grouped with the amendment proposed by the noble Viscount.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para15"></a>Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 stand in my name and that of the noble Earl, Lord Erroll. As the noble Viscount said, we have now reached Part 3, which deals with permit schemes. I draw the Committee's attention to Clause 32(2)(c) which provides, in general terms, for a permit scheme to enable specified works to be carried out without a permit, whatever those specified works are. They are not defined in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para16"></a>Ministers are already committed, through discussions in another place, to talks with the utilities on the issues surrounding emergency and minor works at the regulations stage. However, as Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 clearly set out, we should consider exempting emergency and minor work in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para17"></a>Even with the most efficiently-run permit scheme, administrative delays are, from time to time, bound to occur. It is wholly desirable that, for example, gas or water escapes and electrical faults&#151;perhaps above all&#151;should be exempt from any requirement for permits, because any delay in dealing with those matters could be dangerous. Of course, there is no <P>


<a name="column_113"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>point in the permit scheme being applicable to short-lived emergencies and works of short duration. If anyone thinks that retrospective permits might meet the bill, that would seem to me pointlessly to clog the system.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para18"></a>By their nature, minor works are very different from the substantial, highly visible road works that so irritate the travelling public in general and the noble Lord, Lord Peyton of Yeovil, in particular. Ten years ago, cable companies were digging up the roads on a grand scale across the country to create the backbone networks that are now largely complete. Now, most of the digging up in respect of telecoms companies is to connect customers' houses. That is minor works causing minor disruption.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para19"></a>When this general area of emergency and minor works was discussed in another place, my honourable friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, Mr Andrew Miller, said that we need a practical mechanism that distinguishes between short-term slit trenches, which might be there for a couple of hours, and major road works that may require a whole road to be dug up, perhaps to replace a sewer.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para20"></a>In response to an amendment somewhat similar to Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 before the Grand Committee, the Minister said that he preferred to flesh out the specifics in regulations.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para21"></a>The New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, which the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, drew our attention to a few times earlier this afternoon, contains definitions in the Act itself. Perhaps the Government consider it undesirable for there to be definitions in the Act as to what are emergencies and minor works. The Government may want to have the greater flexibility that regulations permit in enabling wording to be changed more easily from time to time. That is fine. I can fully understand that. But, at least let us have in the Bill something a little clearer than the phrase "specific works" in Clause 32(2)(c), which I mentioned earlier. Let us have a greater commitment by Government to exemptions for emergency and minor works by a specific reference, as Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 would provide for, rather than the present one in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I should like to speak briefly to this group of amendments. I find Clause 32 a little circular. The permit scheme is designed to control the carrying out of specified works in specified streets in a specified area. However,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'specified' means specified, or of a description specified, in a permit scheme".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-36_para22"></a>
I am a little confused as to what is and what is not specified.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para23"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, made a very good point about emergency works&#151;however quick the permit scheme is, the gas will still be blowing out. We shall come to the issue later, but if the utilities are going to be fined somewhere between 500 and 1,000, which is the figure being talked about, if they do not have a permit, what will they do&#151;let the gas blow up, <P>


<a name="column_114"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>let the water flood or whatever? It is reasonable that the utilities should inform the highway authority as soon as possible. However, in emergency situations, surely that could be done retrospectively.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para24"></a>My last point is that we need to get into more detail, as my noble friend Lord Borrie said, and have the appropriate level of permit difficulty, depending not just on the urgency of the works but on the type of street that it is in. I believe that many things could be done quite successfully without a permit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-36_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that utilities frequently have recourse to say things are an emergency. It may be an emergency to shut off water supplies or gas, as has been mentioned. However, we are talking about strategic roads for the most part. To close them is a very serious inconvenience. The alternative available in most cases is plating the hole. After the hole has been dug and the services have been turned off, it is usually some time before replacement facilities are available. There is absolutely no reason, other than costs to the utility, why steel or other devices&#151;plates&#151;should not be placed over the top so that traffic can recommence circulating.
<P>

<a name="40427-36_para25"></a>In considering the amendment, I hope that the fact the road need not remain closed, but can be reopened to traffic in the interim, is borne in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-37_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   It may help if I set out in advance how we seek to progress some of the secondary legislation in Parts 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill in parallel with the parliamentary process.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para0"></a>In these parts of the Bill there is a provision for approximately 12 sets of regulations. However, the Government do not intend to bring all of these in at the same time. The Department for Transport has set up three working groups made up of representatives from local authorities and utilities to look at some of the priority areas. The three groups are looking at regulations and guidance in the following areas: one group is looking at the provisions for permits under Part 3 of the Bill; a second group is looking at the various powers relating to noticing of street works under Part 4 of the Bill. These include changes to the powers for street authorities to make directions and restrictions. A third group is looking at the provisions for fixed penalties for noticing offences under the New Roads and Street Works Act which are covered under Part 4 of the Bill, and some additional offences under the Highways Act which are covered in Part 5 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para1"></a>The purpose of the groups is to consider the details of how we can implement the provisions in the Bill for secondary legislation. These groups will make recommendations to Ministers. We believe that consultation with interested stakeholders is very important. These groups have a role to play in terms of thinking through the practicalities of how some of the measures in the Bill could be implemented&#151;a view that has been expressed in this short debate. Indeed, the Government have tabled amendments that we shall discuss later in relation to the work of the second group <P>


<a name="column_115"></a>

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column 115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and powers to restrict further works from being carried out in a street where substantial road works have taken place.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para2"></a>I am sure that most of the discussion that takes place here in the Committee will be very useful and will cover points that we can ask the three groups to consider. We believe that this is a very important process that will help us to get the secondary legislation right. All noble Lords will be able to convey their views to the working parties. Nothing will be done behind closed doors.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para3"></a>I turn to the amendments. Clause 32 defines the meaning of a permit scheme and allows the scheme to control specified types of work in specified streets. The detail of the types of streets that a scheme could cover may be set out in regulations. We are consulting both with utilities and local authorities as part of drawing up such regulations.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para4"></a>Amendment No. 95 would confine a permit scheme to traffic-sensitive streets and remove the flexibility that we currently provide for in the Bill. Traffic-sensitive streets are designated by an authority and, as a result, utilities must give authorities more advance notice that they intend to carry out works. The criteria for designating such streets are set out in regulations made under the New Roads and Street Works Act. Traffic sensitive streets have to satisfy certain criteria including being a trunk or principal road or having a high vehicle or pedestrian traffic flow. Other streets outside the criteria can be designated as traffic-sensitive but only with the agreement of utilities which have apparatus in that street.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para5"></a>Given the apparently broad criteria of streets that can be designated as traffic-sensitive, it may be thought reasonable to confine permit schemes to these streets. Indeed, there may well be cases in which an authority only wants the permit scheme to apply to these streets. However, other authorities might identify streets in their area where it is reasonable to apply a permit scheme and find that some do not fit into the existing parameters. They may be unable to get agreement from utilities that they should be designated as traffic-sensitive and hence they could not come under the control of permit schemes.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para6"></a>We think it is reasonable that regulations for permit schemes set out the details of the type of streets that can be covered. We are discussing the detail of these regulations with utilities and authorities and we also expect to issue guidance on permit schemes. What is more, any scheme can only come into effect once it has been approved by order by the Secretary of State or relevant national authority. There will, therefore, be safeguards against a local authority applying a scheme unreasonably to streets in its area.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para7"></a>Amendment No. 98 defines what is meant by a traffic-sensitive street. It refers to Section 64 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, which allows the Secretary of State to prescribe the arrangements for a street authority designating a street as traffic-sensitive.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 would require permanent schemes to contain provision allowing for certain works to be carried out without permits. The <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>former would mean that works for public safety would not require permits and would allow an authority operating a scheme to exempt other works which it considers to be emergencies or otherwise urgent. The latter would enable an authority to allow works which it considered were minor and which cause little or no disruption to be executed without a permit. In fact, Clause 36(2)(c) already allows for regulations to set out which works, such as emergencies, or very minor works, can be carried out without a permit. We are discussing with authorities and utilities what exemptions would be sensible as part of drawing up the regulations.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para9"></a>I hope that it will reassure noble Lords to know that we are very clear that no obstacles should be put in the way of dealing with dangerous or potentially dangerous situations such as gas leaks. That said, when a utility carries out emergency work, there can be delays in dealing with the works that follow on from the emergency. For example, once the immediate danger of a gas leak has been dealt with, the utility may not act as swiftly as it should to fill in the hole it has dug. Many noble Lords could give examples of this from their own experience. In these circumstances, a permit scheme would exempt works necessary to deal with the danger of the leak, but once the immediate danger had been dealt with, certain conditions could still be imposed on the follow-up work through a permit. By explicitly exempting emergency works on the face of the Bill, this type of distinction would be more difficult. The best way in which to deal with this problem, therefore, is not to define the cases where emergencies are exempt from permits in the Bill but to allow for regulations to cover exactly how an exemption applies and the relevant details.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para10"></a>In drawing up regulations, we may also consider other categories of exemption. However, we would need to discuss carefully how sensible it is to exempt minor works as these can cause significant disruption if they are in a busy street. For example, a small excavation in Victoria Street in the rush hour can have a great impact on traffic. Again, this is detail best left to regulations rather than on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para11"></a>I have given a rather lengthy answer, but I think it underlines the importance we attach to the points that noble Lords have raised. But on the basis of what I have said, I hope that the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="40427-37_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I, too, am grateful for the Minister's explanation. I have two points. Any costs that the utilities have to pay are bound to be passed on to the consumer. The consumer will suffer if we introduce a scheme that suddenly makes utilities pay much larger <P>


<a name="column_117"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>costs than at present but does not, at the same time, allow the whole process to happen more easily, quickly and effectively, which is what we all want.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para12"></a>I shall study with care what the Minister said. My concern is that we should ensure that we have a focus so that utilities have a real incentive to deal with issues on major roads, as it were, that cause congestion, and that we do not have a permit scheme which does not differentiate regarding the importance of major and minor roads. After all, we want the major strategic arteries of our network to be dealt with as fast as possible. They should be dealt with first, not second.
<P>

<a name="40427-37_para13"></a>The Minister made some important statements about emergency works and permits. That is a matter that we shall study carefully to see whether we need to return to it on Report, or, indeed, whether we want to discuss it with the Minister beforehand. The Minister says that there will be consultation. I am sure that that consultation will be open. He also said that nothing would be done behind closed doors, but of course nothing is decided behind closed doors except the final decision which is made by the Secretary of State, which is always made behind closed doors. However, I am grateful for the Minister's response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, would allow permit regulations to prescribe time limits by which permit authorities would have to issue permits and how long permits would be effective for.

<P>

<a name="40427-38_para2"></a>I absolutely agree with the noble Lord that these are very important matters. That is why we want to deal with them all in regulations.

<a name="40427-38_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to obtain further clarification on this clause and this whole section of the Bill, but specifically regarding measures allowing the national authority to direct compulsory application to set up a permit scheme.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para10"></a>A provision to require a local authority to apply to take on a new function appears to be at odds with the Government's commitment to ensure local freedoms and flexibilities. Obviously, some sort of co-ordination is necessary. We must be careful not needlessly to multiply the types of permit system in operation and thereby further increase the complexity and weight of the red tape that utility companies have to wade through. However, we must be mindful of the fact that imposed national arrangements are not usually the best solution to widely varying traffic enforcement problems.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para11"></a>Clause 33(1) generously permits local authorities to submit a permit scheme. However, Clause 33(2) states that this must be a scheme which,

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"takes such form as he may direct".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40427-38_para12"></a>

<a name="40427-38_para13"></a><P>

<a name="40427-38_para14"></a>I cannot be the only one unconvinced by the Minister's protestations in the other place that the Government were not trying to force a permit scheme on anybody. As it stands, Clause 33(2) moves too close towards doing just that; threatening to strait-jacket a permit scheme onto the circa 1.1 million individual street works a year. The LGA is quite right to be concerned for the Government's previous commitments to local freedoms and flexibilities.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para15"></a>I wonder whether the system will be flexible enough to allow the appropriate national authority to take note if specific local authorities are inundated with a particularly large volume of permit applications relating to urgent maintenance or high government priority projects like broadband roll-out or urban regeneration corridors?

<a name="40427-38_para16"></a>How much room for manoeuvre can we expect for local authorities now we have seen the draft guidance mentioned in Clause 33(5)(b)? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Amendment No. 99 would remove the power for the Secretary of State or National Assembly for Wales to be able to direct one or more local highway authorities to prepare and submit a permit scheme to him.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para17"></a>I should make clear at the outset that this would be a reserve power and not one of which we would envisage making frequent use. We believe that in general it should be for individual local authorities to decide whether they wish to take advantage of the additional powers which a permit scheme would allow them to exercise on their streets.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para18"></a>That said, we think that it would be sensible to retain a reserve power of this sort. We would expect to give further details of the circumstances in which this power might be used in the guidance document, which we intend issuing alongside the regulations activating the permit powers. Once a draft of the guidance is available we shall listen to any views that noble Lords and others may wish to express.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para19"></a>However, in order to illustrate a possible scenario in which the power might be used, it might be that all but one or two London boroughs decide to operate a standard permit scheme. If that were to happen, there is an argument that it would allow for better management and co-ordination of works for a standard scheme to operate across the capital.

<a name="40427-38_para20"></a>I hope that in the light of this short explanation the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I thank the Minister for his explanations. Obviously, until we see the guidance we cannot fully understand the ability to use this reserve power. Perhaps the noble Lord could tell us when he expects that the guidance will be issued.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-38_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We expect the draft guidance to be ready in late summer&#151;that is, July or August.

<P>
<A NAME="40427-38_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   Perhaps we can press the noble Lord a little more on the guidance. Obviously it will be issued after we have completed the Bill, so we will not have a full understanding. I have considerable sympathies with his sensible suggestion that a standard scheme with a single arrangement for all authorities would be sensible, would simplify the position and cut the red tape. That said, and obviously until we have considered the matter more carefully, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427-38_spmin3"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </B>  My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

<B>27 Apr 2004 : Column WS26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para25"></a>My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister has published for public consultation proposed changes to the Ashford growth area section of Chapter 12 of regional planning guidance for the south-east (RPG9). They follow the public examination into the draft in December 2003 and the panel report in February 2004.

<P>

<a name="40427-38_para26"></a>Growth areas are an integral part of regional planning guidance (RPG) and the draft chapter represents a revision to RPG9, as published in March 2001.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para27"></a>Other partial reviews of RPG9 are at various stages in the process. In particular, a public examination into the Milton Keynes and south Midlands sub-regional strategy is under way, and the Secretary of State's proposed changes for the regional transport strategy are out for consultation.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para28"></a>Ashford is both a centre for regional economic development and a gateway to Europe. Growth must bring real benefits to the whole community, which is why our proposed policies promote the right development in the right place at the right time.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para29"></a>The regional planning guidance needs to define new policies which will not only support the projected growth of housing and jobs in Ashford but guide this growth in a sustainable way.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para30"></a>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister proposes accepting all the recommendations of the independent panel that held the public examination into the proposed alterations, with minor modifications.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para31"></a>I have written to the regional assembly with the proposed changes. There will now be a public consultation period on the proposed changes, which will end on 17 June.
<P>

<a name="40427-38_para32"></a>Copies of the relevant documents are available in the Libraries of the House and have been provided for all of the region's MPs, MEPs and local authorities.

<A NAME="40427w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </B>  The Chief Executive of Water Service (Mrs Katharine Bryan) has replied to the noble Lord in response to this Question.
<P>

<a name="40427w01_para0"></a>Letter from Mr Trevor Haslett (on behalf of the Chief Executive of the Water Service) to Lord Kilclooney dated 7 April 2004.
<P>

<a name="40427w01_para1"></a>You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question (PQ 1197) about proposals to provide a new sewage disposal works in the village of Ballywalter, County Down. The Chief Executive of Water Service was asked to respond as the issue falls within her operational responsibility, and I am replying on her behalf as she is currently on annual leave.
<P>

<a name="40427w01_para2"></a>Under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Regulations (NI) 1995, Water Service will have to upgrade waste water treatment facilities at a number of coastal discharge points on the east coast of the Ards peninsula, including Ballywalter. It is estimated that this will cost around &#163;10 million, and is part of a larger investment of around &#163;650 million required to upgrade waste water treatment works across Northern Ireland over the next six years. This level of investment cannot be met by public expenditure alone. Water Service, in liaison with the Strategic Investment Board, is therefore taking forward a major public/private partnership programme to upgrade both water and waste water treatment facilities. The provision of new waste water facilities for the east coast of the Ards peninsula is currently included in the &#163;130 million PPP waste water programme and it is planned to award the contracts for the procurement of the waste water infrastructure projects in 2007.

<A NAME="40427w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  Tables 1 and 2 of Civil Partnership: A framework for the legal recognition of same-sex couples provided information about a wide range of partnership schemes in other countries for comparative purposes. It is not appropriate for all these relationships to be listed in Schedule 14 to the Bill. In some cases this is because the overseas relationship in question does not meet one or more of the "general conditions" contained in Clause 154, for example because it does not involve registration of the partnership. It is not considered appropriate to treat relationships of this kind as civil partnerships. In other cases, it was decided not to include a relationship in Schedule 14 until further research has been completed.
<P>

<a name="40427w01_para3"></a>Officials continue to gather information on relationships in other countries and territories in order to determine whether they should be added to the list contained in Schedule 14. There will be a continual need to review and update this list as new kinds of relationship come into effect in other countries. Clause 153 of the Bill allows for the schedule to be amended by subordinate legislation.
<P>

<a name="40427w01_para4"></a>The absence of a relationship from Schedule 14 does not preclude the parties to such a relationship from being treated as civil partners in the UK, if the relationship meets the "general conditions" laid down in Clause 154, provided the other requirements of Clauses 152 to 158 are met.

<A NAME="40427w01_spmin4"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 implement into UK law Directive 2001/20/EC relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. The regulations were laid before the House on 1 April to enable the UK to fulfil its obligation under European Community law to implement the directive by 1 May 2004.
<P>

<a name="40427w01_para6"></a>The Government have consulted extensively with stakeholders on the UK regulations. Consultation has been ongoing through workshops and meetings with key stakeholders including the pharmaceutical industry, ethics committees, those responsible for medical research and development in the National Health Service, the academic community and medical research charities. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency conducted a formal consultation exercise between February and May 2003 and received over 160 responses from a wide range of stakeholders including the pharmaceutical industry and those involved in non-commercial trials. Following this, the Government established a Medical Research Council/Department of Health joint project to help to develop practical solutions to some of the potential problems identified by non-commercial trialists. Throughout the process of drawing up the regulations I have had numerous meetings with, and written to, various groups and individuals with interests in non-commercial trials to keep them informed of progress and to seek feedback. Where possible, the Government have taken account of the concerns of stakeholders in the regulations laid before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40427w01_para7"></a>Scrutiny of these regulations will be the same as for any other statutory instrument under the negative procedure. The regulations have been brought to the attention of Parliament and it is always open to Members to lay a prayer against such regulations. I wrote to a wide range of stakeholders including Front- Bench spokesmen on 1 April to inform them of the laying of the regulations. I understand that a Starred Question has been tabled for response in the House of Lords on 5 May and a Prayer against the regulations will be debated in the House of Commons on 25 May.

(1) Annual figures cover births occurring in each calendar year. However, a very small number of births are registered too late to be included in the counts for the appropriate year and are instead included in those for the following year.<P>

(2) Mean is the arithmetical average time elapsed.<P>

(3) Median represents the time within which exactly half of the children were registered.<P>

<a name="40427w02_para5"></a>The Office for National Statistics estimates the number of British citizens entering the United Kingdom using data from the International Passenger Survey and the Irish Central Statistical Office. They are identified from the nationality shown on their passport.
<P>

<a name="40427w02_para6"></a>A migrant is defined as someone who changes his or her country of usual residence for a period of at least a year, so that the country of destination effectively becomes the country of usual residence. Thus, only British citizens returning to the UK with the intention of staying for a year or more, having spent over a year living abroad, will be included in the annual statistics of net international migration.

<A NAME="40427w02_wqn2"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will encourage train operators to ensure that trains carry ramps so that disabled passengers can disembark from trains at unstaffed stations or in an emergency; and [HL2488]
<P>
Why some train operators have installed low tables, under which people using wheelchairs cannot put their legs, at some of the places allocated to disabled passengers on trains. [HL2489]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40427w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   We have introduced regulations under Part 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requiring all new trains entering service from 1 January 1999 to be accessible to disabled people. During the past two and half years, over 1,400 new fully accessible rail vehicles have entered service and there will be over 1,000 more within the next 18 months.
<P>

<a name="40427w02_para7"></a>The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations specify a range of features to help disabled people, including those who need to travel in wheelchairs. The regulations require the operator of a regulated rail vehicle to supply a boarding device (generally a ramp) to enable wheelchair users to board and alight from the train. The ramp can be either stowed on the train or kept at the station but it must in either case be made available for use when a disabled passenger needs it.

<a name="40427w02_para8"></a>The regulations also require a table to be provided for passengers using the wheelchair accessible space. They stipulate that the lowest point on the underside of the tabletop in a regulated vehicle must be not less than 720 mm vertically above the floor of the vehicle. This dimension is prescribed to ensure that a wheelchair user is provided with comfortable legroom below the table when it is in use.

<a name="40427w02_para9"></a>I am not aware that any new trains are being fitted with tables that do not comply with these specifications. If this were the case, the operators would be in breach of the regulations.
<P>

<a name="40427w02_para10"></a>Trains that came into service before the regulations were introduced are not subject to these requirements as a matter of law although many do offer good levels of access both to wheelchair users and other disabled people.
