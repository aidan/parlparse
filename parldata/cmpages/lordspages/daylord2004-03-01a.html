<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Gale </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What measures they are taking to increase the representation of women in the House of Commons and local government to a level more like that seen in the elections to the National Assembly for Wales in 2003.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My Lords, the Government are committed to working towards gender equality throughout society, including in political life, and we are delighted that the people of Wales have chosen to elect women to 50 per cent of seats in the National Assembly for Wales. To facilitate progress towards increasing women's representation in government, we introduced the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002, which allows political parties to take positive measures towards women's increased participation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gale: </B>   My Lords, I say thank you and diolch yn fawr to my noble friend. As everyone knows, Welsh is the language of heaven and I am very pleased to bring a touch of heaven to your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="40301-01_para0"></a>My noble friend is aware that the Welsh Assembly is the only legislature in the world to have women as 50 per cent of its members. Is she further aware that the Cabinet in the Welsh Assembly has a majority of women and is, again, the only such institution in the world to have such a majority? Bearing in mind that, since 1918, only 253 women have been elected to the House of Commons and that only a minority of women serve in local government, does she agree that drastic measures are needed to ensure that the percentage of women in local government and the House of Commons is increased? If such measures are not taken, we will probably have to wait several centuries. Some of us will not be able to hang around that long.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend on her perseverance and because it is St David's Day. It is a great achievement for Wales to have the first elected legislature anywhere with 50 per cent representation by women. We in the House of Lords can be quite proud of our record. Seven out of the 21 members of the Labour Front Bench are women, and the figures are 10 out of 32 for <P>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 434</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Conservatives and 11 out of 37 for the Liberal Democrats. Opportunities are certainly being taken in this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I declare a long-time interest in the 300 Group, of which I am a member and was an executive officer for many years. Does the noble Baroness agree with the policy about which I used to say, "We don't want any woman elected just because she's a woman, but we don't want her rejected because she's a woman"? Does she further agree that most constituencies want and deserve the very best candidate to be their MP, whatever their religion, race or gender? Our policies at least produced the first female Leader of the House of Lords and the first female Prime Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I wholeheartedly agree that we want people of merit and quality. We think that we have achieved that; the Labour Government have an extremely good record in that regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that if one looks across the legislatures of the democratic world, one finds that in those countries that have a form of proportional representation women&#151;and, indeed, ethnic minorities&#151;do better than in those countries with first past the post, such as this country and the United States?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, that has been a hotly contentious issue for a number of years. I cannot necessarily agree with the noble Lord, but I understand why he says so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness tell us whether women in the National Assembly for Wales are under-representative of the proportion of male to female adult voters in Wales?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that that is so, although I understand why the noble Lord would say that. Roughly 50 per cent of the population is male and roughly 50 per cent female, and the noble Lord will say that it would be disproportionate if the Welsh Assembly had more women than men. If one looks at quality and merit, the figures are clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness misunderstood my question. I was asking whether women were under-represented, not over-represented, in the National Assembly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that they are, but I shall write to the noble Lord if I am wrong about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, further to my noble friend's question about proportional representation, the proof is in the fact that the <P>


<a name="column_435"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 435</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>National Assembly for Wales has an element of proportional representation. That is probably why it has done so well in terms of the number of women elected to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Lord says, but it is really the policy that has been implemented&#151;the positive action measures taken, the political parties, and the primary use of twinning by Labour, which was very successful. No country has ever achieved a significant increase in women's representation without positive action. The Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002 allowed that positive action to be taken, and Wales has demonstrated what can be done if one tries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it might be an idea to set some targets in the matter? They should not be about positive discrimination, although targets are popular with this Government. Will they also compare the number of women in both Houses and local government with those in the top 100 FTSE companies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Baroness says about targets. I also hear many on the Benches behind me saying that the most effective methodology would be to join Labour. If that is a target, I endorse it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Brookman: </B>   My Lords, I am somewhat loath to rise on this Question, because I worked in the political arena of Wales with the noble Baroness, Lady Gale, or Anita Gale as she was then known, and she used to frighten the living daylights out of me. Is the Minister aware that Wales is known as the "mother state"? In other words, "mam" has always been completely in charge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, only my noble friend could say that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, without in any way wishing to disparage the quality of women in this House or anywhere else, is the Minister aware that the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Gale, was not in the form of a question, contrary to the conventions of the House?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I think that the noble Baroness asked three questions and she enabled us to have the benefit of a great deal of information in between them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Gale: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that most of the women elected to the Welsh Assembly were elected under the first-past-the-post system and not by the list system?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness makes a valuable point and that is why it is policies and their implementation that make a difference and enable those policies to be fair.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spopq1"></A><B> Baroness Greengross </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What plans they have to amend the rules for student loans so as to benefit those aged 54 and over and part-time students.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, the age limit is 50 for eligible students meeting the residence requirements. Those aged 50 to 54 at the start of their course can also apply for a student loan, provided that they plan to return to work after finishing their course. We already cancel loans at the age of 65 and have no plans to change the age restrictions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Greengross: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the Minister's reply, but I have to say that I am extremely disappointed in it. The Economic Affairs Select Committee of this House recently concluded that student loans were blatantly ageist. Given that people live longer and will have longer working lives, how can the Government's current policies really encourage lifelong learning?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-01_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I pay tribute to the work of the noble Baroness. However, in our proposed changes that are currently before the House of Commons there will be a 25-year debt write-off and the existing write-off at the age of 65 will continue. The proposed new higher education grant will also have no age limit attached to it, which is important. There are many instances regarding vocational training, further education and so on, where we have a good story to tell in terms of supporting older learners.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend comment on the work of the Open University in providing education for people of all ages at a price that is within peoples' pockets?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, indeed, I pay enormous tribute to the Open University and say to my noble friend that the existing position of repayable loans for part-time students will be replaced with a non-repayable grant within a means-tested system that will apply to all students, regardless of age.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that in practice the Higher Education Bill on top-up fees discriminates against part-time workers? Why on earth can she not concede that something needs to be done now, in respect of part-time workers as students, because so many need to pursue their further education for themselves and the country? If ageism is to be defeated, that should apply equally to allow the over-50s such as myself to study.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   Surely not, my Lords. As I gallop towards that age I am well aware of the matter.
<P>


<a name="column_437"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 437</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-02_para0"></a>The Bill does not simply concern top-up fees; it is also about a new approach to the funding of higher education and it contains many other measures which I look forward to debating in your Lordships' House. Also, regarding my comments about part-time higher education students, it is worth reiterating that we are replacing loans with a grant. Eight grants will be available, as opposed to six loans. There will be no age limits for grants. We believe that we have a good package. Regarding other students being able to access courses, we have a good story to tell on access to further education for people of all ages&#151;and rightly so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that although she is replacing loans with grants for students at the Open University, the lack of availability of loans to those students discriminates against people who wish to study part time to acquire a degree? Given that the Open University offers by far and away the most cost-effective form of degree training in this country, why are we discriminating against its students?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that I agree with the noble Baroness that we discriminate against those students. The point of the present loans system is that a loan has to be repaid. As I believe I said in my Answer, those older people who are able to verify by declaration that they intend to go back to work and will be able to pay back the loan are included. Although we keep the matter under review and I am aware of the work being carried out in this field, it is important that we look at the resources available for higher education and where we need to enable our students to access the available loans and grants. I believe that we have the balance right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the changes that the Minister described to support part-time students. Does she agree that part-time students form the key to our aims of widening participation, and that the costs of teaching such students should be borne in mind in the Higher Education Funding Council's allocation to universities, particularly since part-time students will not be able to take advantage of the proposed graduate contributions scheme?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend. It is important that we recognise the contribution of part-time students to the Government's aspiration to ensure that people are able to access higher education. I agree that we would expect that to form a part of the way in which the Higher Education Funding Council thinks about its allocation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell the House what representations the Government have received regarding financial arrangements for these students?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness will be well aware that Age Concern recently <P>


<a name="column_438"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 438</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>published a report, and the department is currently considering its response. I would be happy to write to the noble Baroness with more detail of those individuals and groups that may have been in touch with the Government. We are aware of the work of the House of Lords Committee, and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, Age Concern and other organisations with which we have an active relationship. We keep these issues under review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recognise that many students who sadly drop out of full-time higher education turn to the Open University to enable them to complete their degree? I declare an interest as a past vice-chairman of the Open University. Does the Minster agree that unless and until the current plans are changed, those universities' part-time studies will be left at a trading disadvantage and that the present arrangement discriminates against the disadvantaged students whom it most aims to help?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, we have addressed that issue to a degree in the package that we have described for part-time students. It is important to recognise that it is not only through higher education that those aged 50 and over are able to be involved in lifelong learning. For example, 25 per cent of all enrolments on adult education courses in November 2002 were made by individuals aged 60 or over. It is important that we think across the piece in terms of the education opportunities for all our citizens and our older citizens in particular in this context.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the Government have no plans at present to remove the reasonable chastisement defence, as we believe that the law as it stands on physical punishment of children reflects the right balance between protecting children and allowing parents to make their own choices about discipline in the home. The Government are aware of the experience of other European countries, and we take this into account in the ongoing monitoring of our current policy.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her Answer. Will she accept that in those countries that have given children equal protection, along with a lot of public education and help for parents, the benefits have been enormous, including a reduction in the number of prosecutions of parents and a reduction in the number of compulsory interventions from social services? Public opinion is now overwhelmingly in favour of the policy. In the 10th report of the Joint Committee on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, it was proposed that the UK Government review the experiences of those countries that have given equal protection to children. Do the Government intend to act on that recommendation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, when one looks across at our European colleagues it is interesting, as the noble Baroness rightly said, to look at the implications of the changes they have made and what we can see happening in issues around children&#151;it is an important part of the work that we do. In response to her final question about the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, we keep a watchful eye and we are consistently in conversation with our colleagues in different European countries about their experiences. It is hard to look for causal relationships in these areas, as one would expect. None the less, it is interesting. As the noble Baroness said, public opinion in different countries has led to different initiatives being taken. In this country, there is a reasonably strong view that the position of the Government is correct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Laming: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister do everything that she can to remind the front-line services that the Children Act 1989 places a duty on services to put the well-being of children in a paramount position? That means listening to the child rather than to the wishes of the adults in the child's life.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I could not agree more strongly with the noble Lord, Lord Laming. It is absolutely critical that we recognise that nothing that I have said suggests in any way that we should be anything other than ever-watchful for abuse of children under all circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, could the Minister please try to use her influence to persuade the Government to make use of the Children Bill to bring forward legislation that totally complies with the European Court of Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which have both criticised the Government's attitude about hitting children? Surely she could do something to get us in line with the rest of Europe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I look forward to the introduction of the Bill. I surmise that it will not be me who brings forward this issue on our deliberations, but it will arise in the course of our debate. I look forward to those debates.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, could the Minister tell the House how out of line we are with the rest of Europe? Apart from the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, which European states that belong to the convention system give this lesser protection to children in the home?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I will answer the noble Lord's question the other way around, because I am more clear about those countries that have decided to remove this. In the past 25 years, Austria, Croatia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Latvia, Germany, Cyprus, Iceland, Denmark and Israel have banned the use of corporal punishment on children. I gather that Belgium added a new clause to the constitution confirming children's rights to moral, physical, psychological and sexual integrity. The latest information that I have concerns the last meeting, at which the UK Government were present in Strasbourg, and where there was a great deal of debate.
<P>

<a name="40301-03_para0"></a>Again, I bring your Lordships' attention to the fact that we are not discussing this Government's belief that we should do anything other than protect children from abuse. Talking about what can happen to a child in a loving relationship and discipline in the home is different from discussing what is abuse of children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say how the Government are promoting positive parenting and helping parents under stress set proper boundaries for their children? How are they are encouraging health visitors to get messages across? How are the Government involved in the Sure Start project?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted to raise the issues that the noble Earl has mentioned. It is a critical part of the Sure Start programme to enable parents to get the support and advice that they need on issues of discipline, listening to their child and understanding children's behaviour. That forms part of it. I would be the first to say that we need to do more, but it is an integral part of what we want to achieve.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   My Lords, if the Minister is in favour of listening to children, is she aware that the overwhelming majority of children are in favour of removing the defence of reasonable chastisement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, as a mother, I was thinking of what my children would say on this subject. The noble Baroness made an important point about the need for government, and all of us, to listen to what children are saying. I go back to the point that I made earlier. I am not talking about children who are in any way abused. I am talking about recognising that in the home, in a loving family, there are different modes of discipline. We should be cautious and careful about the way in which we go forward on this issue.

There are many competing demands for resources, and the issue of how they are deployed is an operational matter entirely for the Chief Constable, who must manage those resources and prioritise accordingly. The subject of the past is a difficult and sensitive matter for many people across the community of Northern Ireland. The Government welcome debate, because this is not a question that we can settle on our own. Any solution must be based on a broad consensus.

<P>

<A NAME="40301-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, may be aware that the Chief Constable and the policing board announced in October 2002 a human resource strategy to meet the staffing needs of the police service over the next eight to 10 years. It was stated that from April 2005 there will be a phased run-down of the reserve during an 18-month period,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"subject to no further deterioration of the security situation and the continued success of the recruitment campaign for the Police Service".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-03_para2"></a>
The position of the full-time reserve is to be seen in the context of that whole human resource strategy.
<P>

<a name="40301-03_para3"></a>As regards the incident, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, may be aware that we have asked the Independent Monitoring Commission to examine it in the context of the preparation of its first report on paramilitary activity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Smith of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, given the enormous backlog of unsolved murders, it is clearly a matter of both conciliation and prioritisation. What plans do the Government have for developing reconciliation and what advice and guidance are they offering the Chief Constable with regard to this matter? It is not merely an operational issue; it is also <P>


<a name="column_442"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 442</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one of much wider political consequence in Northern Ireland. I should have thought that the Government would offer guidance to him on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, as I said in my Answer, this is an issue of great sensitivity in Northern Ireland. The Chief Constable has undertaken to ensure that where the evidence is available, it will be looked at by the new team established for this very purpose.
<P>

<a name="40301-03_para4"></a>On reconciliation, there have been calls from a number of quarters for a truth and reconciliation commission. At present, we are saying that debate on the subject is welcome. It is not an issue the Government can settle on their own; we need to address it in a way that commands widespread acceptance and co-operation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree with me that when the Patten commission made its recommendations on the shape and size of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, it had in mind that it would be doing the normal job of a police force? It did not have in mind that it would be doing a series of Bloody Sunday inquiries too, with all the costs that that entails not only in people but in money. Surely, it must be accepted that the present staffing of the police is in no way commensurate with the work that will be required. This is a new situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, that is precisely why the Serious Crime Review Team was established from Monday, 16 February. The work in which it is presently involved includes formulating a response to all external inquiries relating to historical murder investigations. It is proposed that the review team carry out a review of any of those investigations where evidential opportunities have been identified. The noble Baroness is right that the burden on the Police Service of Northern Ireland of undertaking large-scale inquiries is such that the work of this team will be important in taking forward any matter on which it has evidence and has identified where further investigation should take place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, given the present security and political situation, does the Minister believe it appropriate to wait until May for a report on the Tohill incident?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, we have asked the Independent Monitoring Commission to bring forward its report from July to May precisely because we were concerned to have information on the matter as quickly as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, given that the situation has been getting worse for some time and that at the time of the Good Friday agreement some 70 per cent of murders by republicans and 50 per cent by loyalists were unsolved, why has it taken so long to set up this new unit?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, issues needed to be addressed in relation to the work that the unit would <P>


<a name="column_443"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 443</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do. That has now happened. As I said in answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Park, the review team was resourced from Monday, 16 February and its task has been set out clearly. I am happy to write to the noble Lord with further information on that.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-04_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this brings us to the last stages in this House of the European Parliamentary and Local Elections (Pilots) Bill and I have one final amendment to put to the Minister. It is not one with which he will be unfamiliar, nor will he be particularly surprised by it.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para2"></a>I was grateful to the Minister for his openness and willingness to provide information in Committee and on Report. I was particularly grateful for the policy paper he put forward which clearly laid out a number of the matters we have discussed. It provided some resolution to some of the questions we have asked and discussed throughout the passage of the Bill. However, I am concerned that that information will not come to this House in the form of an order so that the House can decide whether it is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para3"></a>The pilot order will lay the base for these elections and will provide all the information. The noble Lord, Lord Evans, or the Minister waved a thick document at me during Committee and asked whether I really wanted to have all of that. The probable answer is that we do. If not, we need to see a pilot order which lays out the principles for the two regions which will be considered. The principles are laid out, more or less, in that policy paper.
<P>


<a name="column_444"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 444</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para4"></a>We in this House have had a great deal of input to the Bill. We have laid down all the parameters for it and it would be reassuring for this House to have the final stamp of authority on what is put forward in the pilot order. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, the amendment is the same as one I tabled in Grand Committee. Although I did not repeat that on Report, I believe that it is desirable. There is no doubt that the pilot order will be sizeable and will contain considerable detail. Some of that is of serious importance. It will operate as a precedent if the pilots prove successful and are introduced generally in future for the procedure to be adopted in all postal elections. It is of considerable importance and it is desirable that your Lordships' House should have some form of input. For that reason, I am happy to support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  My Lords, I seek to keep my remarks succinct to follow the excellent example given me by both the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para5"></a>Essentially, I will say that I do not believe that the amendment is necessary; that there is good reason why we have never done it before; that there are risks of delay in doing so, and that we can offer something better.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para6"></a>On the first point that the amendment is not necessary: that is not simply the Government's view, it is the view of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. When the committee looked at this issue in some detail, mindful of the significance and scale of the pilots that we are talking about, it came to the conclusion that no parliamentary procedure was necessary. The committee's report explicitly stated that the issue of whether the negative procedure was appropriate was considered in coming to its conclusion.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para7"></a>As to the point about never having done it before, over 150 pilot orders have been made under the RPA 2000 for pilots at local elections. Fifty-nine pilot orders were required for pilots in May 2003, and over 30 orders have been made to permit by-election pilots. All these orders involved no parliamentary procedure.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para8"></a>The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, while recognising that the pilot order would refer only to a one-off event, raised issues about how the pilot orders will be publicised. We intend to act on their recommendations. For example, the order will be available on the departmental website and will be supplied to political parties, disability groups and all regional returning officers. We will also produce an easy-to-follow precis of the most relevant parts of the order, which we will distribute in a similar way. The precis will not include large parts of the order, which will be made up of consequential amendments, as those could obscure the clarity of the policy.
<P>


<a name="column_445"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 445</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para9"></a>We are also looking at the possibility of distributing the precis in accessible formats, including Braille and on tape. We will discuss this issue further with disability groups to try to ensure that we take on board their interests and concerns.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para10"></a>As for delay, were we to agree to this process, as the House will know, any Member in another place or here would have a period of 40 days after the order had been laid to table a Prayer to annul it. Until the annulment debate had been concluded, a number of electoral returning officers might feel that, out of caution, they had to keep preparing for a conventional election at the same time as the pilot postal election, which this Bill is all about. That would build in additional delay, risk and cost as a consequence.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para11"></a>However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, was gracious enough to recognise, we have sought to consult and have as much openness and transparency as possible on the process of this Bill, including areas on which we have not been of one mind. We shared our draft policy paper because I could see no good reason why opposition Front Benches should not see it even before officials felt that it was complete, because thereby we would inform the parliamentary process and increase the openness of that process.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para12"></a>What I say now is in a sense better than what is being asked for, because if we agreed to this amendment the only formal powers of the opposition Front Benches would be to vote down the order. While that is theoretically possible, it has rarely been done. It is merely a nuclear option without much influence. Instead I give a commitment that we will continue to provide iterations of the policy paper as it develops, giving opposition Front Benches the opportunity to feed in their comments and allowing them informal scrutiny of any details that might change between now and the making of the order. In this way, your Lordships will not just have seen the policy paper at a certain stage, we will seek continually to share the policy paper with your Lordships throughout that process so that you will know about any further thinking before the order is made.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para13"></a>If any detail changes before the order is made, noble Lords will be made fully aware and have the opportunity to feed into the policy as it is finalised, rather than simply having the ability to oppose the order.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para14"></a>Finally, I will provide Front Benches with a draft of the order before it is made and will be happy to receive any comments on that draft, subject to reasonable expedition&#151;one would not expect such comments to take months.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para15"></a>I hope that I am thus giving a continuing commitment to an inclusive process on the order, recognising that it is important that there is cross-party confidence in the detail of the order, without wishing in any way to imply that we are setting a precedent for all future orders. But we recognise that it is a significant order and it is right and proper that there is the fullest opportunity for opposition Benches to know what is going on and to comment. For these reasons, I hope that while I have not agreed with the <P>


<a name="column_446"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 446</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment, I have gone further than might have been expected in seeking to meet the concerns that underpinned it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. I never cease to be surprised by the Minister's responses and I am grateful for what he has proposed about ensuring that we see the draft order before it is published.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para16"></a>I reassure the Minister that I have no intention of dividing the House on this amendment today. However, despite being able to see the draft order, I believe that that would have been a better process. This House in particular has made immeasurable progress with this Bill and has been very instrumental in ensuring that all the matters that needed to be dealt with have been raised and have now been included. It would have been better if the House had been able to look at the matter formally had it wished. Nevertheless, we have made progress. The Government have responded on at least some of the things that we were concerned about. We will certainly want to scrutinise the draft order. I presume that if it will not be possible for changes to be made then we could bring some of those matters to the House in the form of Questions before the order is passed.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para17"></a>I want to thank the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Evans, for their courtesy during the passage of the Bill. We will not divide the House, although this would have been a much better process, but in future, if there is to be further consideration of pilot powers, this establishes the basis.
<P>

<a name="40301-04_para18"></a>The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee undertook its own scrutiny of what was proposed, but it reported before our debate took place. While the committee took a proper decision, it would have been better if we had had the order. That brings us to the end of that discussion. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40301-05_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this order deals with various national insurance contribution rates and thresholds. The provisions in the order are compatible <P>


<a name="column_447"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 447</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the European Convention on Human Rights. All the changes were announced at the time of the Pre-Budget Report.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para1"></a>For the self-employed, the order raises the small earnings exception, below which, depending on the level of their profits, they may claim exemption from paying class 2 contributions. The exception will rise in April, from £4,095 to £4,215 a year, an increase broadly in line with prices. Many people choose to pay these contributions in order to protect their benefits entitlement. The rate of class 2 contributions for 2004-05 will rise to £2.05 a week, also in line with prices.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para2"></a>Staying with the self-employed, the draft order also sets the profits limits between which main rate class 4 contributions are paid. The lower limit, at which contributions become due, and the upper limit will increase broadly in line with inflation. The lower limit will rise in line with the income tax personal allowance from £4,615 to £4,745 a year. At the other end of the scale, the upper profits limit will continue to match the upper earnings limit for employees, which will go up to £31,720 for 2004-05. This ensures that the self-employed pay main rate class 4 contributions on much the same range of earnings as employees liable to class 1 contributions and is an essential element in making the national insurance system fair for everyone.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para3"></a>The draft order also deals with the weekly rate of voluntary class 3 contributions, which help those with insufficient contribution records in any given tax year to make up a qualifying year for benefit purposes. The rate of class 3 will rise in April by 20 pence to £7.15 a week, a standard re-rating in line with prices.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para4"></a>The review of contribution rates is accompanied by a report from the Government Actuary detailing the effects of the draft order, and the draft order uprating benefits laid by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, on the national insurance fund. I am pleased to say that, for the sixth year in a row, there is no expectation that the fund will need a Treasury grant. Nevertheless, a prudent provision of 2 per cent of all benefit expenditure is made.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para5"></a>Northern Ireland has a separate national insurance scheme from Great Britain, but the two schemes are closely co-ordinated and maintain parity of contribution rates. This draft order covers both Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I commend the order to the House.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para6"></a>Moved, That the order laid before the House on 4 February be approved [8th report from the Joint Committee.]&#151;(Lord Davies of Oldham).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   My Lords, the debate on this annual order is a valuable opportunity to examine the key issues surrounding national insurance contributions, which have come into the spotlight since the Chancellor's decision to raise them last April. We are particularly privileged this year in that, in <P>


<a name="column_448"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 448</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contrast to last year, we have the opportunity to discuss the order in this House before it goes to another place.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para7"></a>It is important to examine the order in the context of the increases in national insurance that the Government have already introduced. I am sure that outside the Westminster village people are well aware of these rises, as they have seen the large dents that have been made in their pay packets. It is worthwhile reminding the House, lest anyone here forgets, that national insurance contributions rose by 1 per cent last April. This increase applied to all earnings over £4,615, not just to those below the ceiling, and employers also have to pay an additional 1 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para8"></a>These increases came despite the Prime Minister's assertion before the last election that people should not suppose that he proposed to increase national insurance. My party has consistently argued that the increases are a tax on jobs and we see no reason to change that view. It is noteworthy that the Explanatory Notes claim that the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"order does not impose any new costs on business".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-05_para9"></a>
Perhaps this is technically correct; the damage to business has already been done by the increases brought in last April. For their part, the Government have argued that the increases are necessary to increase spending on the health service but a 37.5 per cent increase in spending has brought only a 5 per cent increase in hospital activity. It is increasingly clear that the NHS needs not just more money, but also meaningful reform.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para10"></a>In the light of last year's national insurance increases, in the Pre-Budget Report published last December the Chancellor announced that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"NICs threshold and limits will also increase in line with inflation. There will be no change in NICs rates for employers and employees, or the profit-related NICs paid by the self-employed, in 2004-2005".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-05_para11"></a>
I am intrigued to see that this order applies to only the rates of class 2 contributions by the self-employed, class 3 voluntary contributions and the thresholds for the class 4 profit-related contributions paid by the self-employed.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para12"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister would explain why the thresholds, the lower earnings limit, the primary threshold and the ceiling are not being raised for class 1 contributions. I would also be grateful for an explanation of the level of increase in each case: class 2 contributions are to rise by 2.5 per cent; class 3 contributions and the threshold for class 2 contributions are to rise by 2.9 per cent. The lower limit for class 4 contributions is to rise by 2.8 per cent and the upper limit by 2.5 per cent. Why is there no consistency? I listened carefully to the Minister but I would still like clarification on this question.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para13"></a>I note that my colleague, the then shadow Paymaster General, raised this issue in another place last year. He was told that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We rounded the figures to make them easier and more understandable, both for employers and for our constituents".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, 6/3/03; col. 15.]

<a name="column_449"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 449</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
If the aim was to increase everything by as near as possible to the retail prices index inflation measure of 2.8 per cent, as according to an announcement by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in another place is occurring with national insurance benefits, the threshold for class 2 contributions would be set at £4,210, rather than £4,215, and the upper limit for class 4 would be £31,810. I have no doubt that an explanation of the Government's thinking in these cases will be very enlightening. I am sure that the Minister will explain at any minute.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para15"></a>As I have said, it is fortunate that this time we have an opportunity to debate this order, especially as we are discussing it before it goes to another place. I would therefore be very grateful if the Minister would address my queries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, rightly pointed out, the national insurance fund has taken on a significance that it might not have in other years. Those of us in this House who eagerly await the emergence of the Pensions Bill from another place find ourselves unduly fascinated by the subject.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para16"></a>I have just one substantial question for the Minister, which is about the state of the out-turn on the national insurance fund. My honourable friend in another place Steve Webb pressed the Minister on this point and he got no joy. It is a significant matter and therefore I am following up his question.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para17"></a>In Appendix 7, the actual out-turn on the national insurance fund of £1.75 billion is compared to the estimate that the cost of administration of the fund would be about £1 billion. The estimated cost of administration has gone up by £750 million. The footnotes give two reasons. One is that it was one-off payment to the Welfare Modernisation Fund. My colleagues in another place have tabled Questions about exactly what the payment was and how it was broken down. So far, answers have not been forthcoming.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para18"></a>It seems that this fund is being used by the Department for Work and Pensions on interesting and curious schemes, notably its administration, simply because there is, as the Minister said, a healthy balance in the fund. Indeed, for the sixth year running there is no need for a Treasury grant. However, £750 million is a sizeable amount to be moved into departmental administration. Will the Minister tell us why the costs of administration have risen so much and why the money has not been spent on national insurance benefits?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the contributions from the two noble Baronesses who have spoken in this debate.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para19"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, asked why level 1 is not included in the order. Class 1 will be increased in the same proportions and under the same principles in a different set of regulations which come into force in April. They are not included in this order; they are in different regulations.
<P>


<a name="column_450"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 450</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para20"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned the increase of 1 per cent surcharge last year with regard to the NHS. I hear yet again that doleful and yet, I assume, well meaning cry from opposition Benches that such imposts have the most devastating effect on the employment prospects of our fellow citizens. I merely report that this is what they said last year in anticipation of this measure and they are reiterating it now. Last year they had at least the benefit of their supposed foresight without any evidence. Their view is being reiterated today when they have the evidence; namely, that Britain's employment level is at the highest it has ever been and that the unemployment level is historically not just very low in this country but is low compared with any other economy in the western world. Yet I am charged at the Dispatch Box with the view that, if one dares to increase expenditure on the National Health Service in this way, it will have the most devastating effect upon employment levels in the country. That is just not so.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para21"></a>As for the impact on the National Health Service, we all recognise that one does not just flick a switch and expect an immediate response when dealing with a body that is so significant. It requires&#151;and this is what we are planning&#151;substantial increased investment over a number of years, of which the last year has been a very significant one. The noble Baroness knows that we have already been able to increase significantly the number of doctors and nurses in the health service. We have seen improvements in our hospitals&#151;that is the daily experience of our fellow citizens.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para22"></a>I do not pretend that we will create the desirable position of the National Health Service overnight. We all know that there are very significant demands upon its resources. Nevertheless, I defy anyone in this House to suggest that the increased expenditure on the National Health Service, particularly on increased numbers of doctors and nurses, is not money well spent on the health of our fellow citizens.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para23"></a>The noble Baroness also raised the issue of the upper limits of the figures. I heard what she said. There is no arithmetical accuracy on the translation of the inflation rate to the two figures she quoted. On a figure of £31,801 we are £70 out. My mathematics is not up to translating that into a percentage but it appears pretty microscopic to me. On the other figure that she quoted, we are £5 out on a figure of over £4,210. Again, it seems that we may be straining at a gnat if we are not able to digest these figures when we say that&#151;in broad terms&#151;they have been increased in line with the level of inflation.
<P>

<a name="40301-05_para24"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, addressed me on the issue of the estimate of the administrative costs. The estimate includes several items that will not be incurred in future years. There was an extra payment made to the department to compensate for an under-payment in 2001-02, and a one-off payment to the Welfare Modernisation Fund. Those two figures explain the bulk of the £750 million to which she referred. They are not recurring costs, but one-offs. I hope I have reassured her of the justification for that increase. I commend the order to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 79:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 13, line 15, leave out "(other than a development plan document)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-06_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40301-06_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 80 and 81. In Committee, I promised the Minister that I would return to the binding nature of the planning inspector's reports. Clearly, my position has not changed; here we are again.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para12"></a>I fundamentally believe that taking away the right of a local authority to question the inspector's report and, instead, to make it bound to it lock, stock and barrel, is wrong, however innocent a provision the Minister believes it to be. The local development documents will be produced locally, they will be consulted on locally and they may have an impact locally. It must be right, therefore, that the final decision on whether they are implemented is in the hands of the local authority. Issues of democratic accountability underlie this matter, and they lead me to believe that this must be the case.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para13"></a>We have had a very considerable quantity of representations on this matter from a number of organisations&#151;including the Local Government Association&#151;that remain extremely concerned about the whole process of the inspector's report being binding in relation to the local development documents.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para14"></a>The Local Government Association is concerned that there will be no final democratic accountability in this situation. There are known instances in which the inspector has made a fundamental error in the judgment. The Local Government Association wishes&#151;as we do&#151;to see this aspect of the plan reduced in line with the amendments that we have tabled. Amendments Nos. 79, 80 and 81 would remove that binding status. We see no reason why subsection (1) should differentiate between local development documents and local development plan documents.
<P>


<a name="column_452"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 452</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para15"></a>Amendment No. 79 would remove the phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"other than a development plan document".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-06_para16"></a>
That goes hand in hand with our Amendment No. 81 that would remove subsections (2) to (4) and ensure that all local development documents, including development plan documents, could be adopted by local authorities as originally prepared, or as modified, without being obliged to adopt the recommendations of the independent examination.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para17"></a>Amendment No. 80 leaves the local planning authorities to decide whether or not to modify the local development documents and to take into account the independent examination. Any modification is therefore down to the discretion of the local planning authority, rather that the inspector having the last and compelling word on the matter.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para18"></a>That is a wholly sensible review of the Bill and a wholly sensible amendment to it. It is one that is widely sought throughout local government and the various bodies that have taken an interest in planning and sent us briefings on it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, this group of amendments includes Amendment No. 80, to which my name is attached, and Amendment No. 83, tabled by us. As the noble Baroness said, they go hand in hand with the first of her amendments, which would delete the provision that states in terms that the local planning authority must not adopt a development plan document unless it does so in accordance with one of the previous subsections. They provide that the document must be as originally prepared, if the inspector recommends that it be adopted; or with modifications recommended by the inspector. That comes to the same thing: subsection (4) provides that the inspector's report should be binding; the amendments remove that provision.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para19"></a>When we debated the matter in Committee at the end of January, the Minister's resistance to changing the clause boiled down to the scope for delay if the inspector's recommendations were not adopted. He said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"inspectors' binding reports are a key to speeding up the plan making system and enhancing community involvement in it ... If a further inquiry into a modification is needed, that process can take six months or longer".&#151;[Official Report, 27/1/04; col. 147.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-06_para20"></a>
I am not sure that I follow the argument that the binding report would advance community involvement; that is a different view of community and of the role of the local authority to mine. Perhaps I shall be struck by lightning for saying this, but if a few months&#151;six to cite the Minister&#151;is needed for a further inquiry, is that a disaster if it means reaching the right outcome?
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para21"></a>There is a fundamental difference of view between us about the democratic process: whether the inspector is likely to be regarded as the creature of the Secretary of State. I accept what the Minister said&#151;either in Committee or on our first day of Report; I forget which&#151;about the independent nature of the inspectorate and about how inspectors inspect the inspectors. That is why I used the phrase about being "regarded as the creature of the Secretary of State".
<P>


<a name="column_453"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 453</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para22"></a>Even leaving that aside, the Government are enthusiastic for localism. The terminology with which all three Front Benches lived during the passage of the recent local government Act is all about freedom and flexibility. But in this instance, it seems that the local authority is not to be allowed to be responsible for its own decisions.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para23"></a>In preparing the local development document, the local planning authority must have regard to its community strategy and, indeed, those of its neighbours. One might say that local development plans are the spatial expression of the community strategy. As I said last time, one has to hold one's mouth straight to get some of those expressions out. There may be quite some scope for the inspector to skew the community strategy by his interpretation and application of it in spatial terms.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para24"></a>The Minister also explained that authorities must act on recommendations that are soundly based, but what if the local planning authority takes the view that they are not soundly based? What are we left with? Judicial review, perhaps, but that will take a lot more time than the process advocated by the noble Baroness and me. Of course, an application for judicial review must be made within six weeks of the decision, but that is not the same as a determination of the issue.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para25"></a>The Minister also said that the inspector could only recommend&#151;or perhaps the term was "make"; I think that it meant "make"&#151;a substantial change to the development plan document if people had had an opportunity to make representations or if it had been considered at the public examination and recommendation or debate supported it. But if the matter is controversial&#151;and we are discussing such matters&#151;there are likely to be views on both sides. We are not discussing clear-cut situations. If the inspector thinks that the development plan document should be significantly changed in some other way, the Minister said that the examination in public would have to be reconvened or the issue referred to the local planning authority.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para26"></a>At the weekend, I looked to see how that was prescribed. I may well have missed it, because the regulations are necessarily&#151;this is not a criticism&#151;detailed and complex, but I could not see where that was provided, certainly not in the Bill. It may be somewhere in the Bill where I did not recognise it, or in draft regulations where I have not spotted it.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para27"></a>In any event, I return to the fundamental issue. The nub of the argument is that development plan documents are a matter for the local planning authority, subject to the Secretary of State's nuclear option under Clauses 21 and 27. The amendments tabled by the noble Baroness and me together do not just improve the Bill, which we all seek to do, but necessarily rebalance where decisions and responsibilities lie. I support the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_time1"></a><H5>3.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I understand why the noble Baronesses have returned to the matter on Report; there are strong feelings about it. However, they are partly based on a misapprehension.
<P>


<a name="column_454"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 454</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para28"></a>We have been clear from the outset that one of the key elements of our planning reforms is for the recommendations of the independent inspector, following an independent examination, to be the final stage of preparing the development plan document. The noble Baronesses have a different position. By implication from the amendments, the opposition parties want to retain the status quo. The two speeches that we have just heard encapsulate the fact that, taken together, this group of amendments would remove the important innovation of binding inspectors' reports on development plan documents.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para29"></a>At the same time, however, through Amendment No. 79, they would muddle up the provisions for adopting local development documents that are not development plan documents&#151;in other words, supplementary planning documents. That is because there is no independent examination of the supplementary planning document. That list of documents and how they interact with one another will probably be the subject of a team meeting later in the week, if I explain that inadequately today. But the fact that such reports are not subject to independent examination could cause confusion. A local authority could not take account of the inspectors' recommendations on such reports, because there would not be any&#151;that is the whole point.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para30"></a>The picture that has been painted is that of the local authority's legitimate wishes versus the uninformed wishes of a creature of central government, with the community's views squeezed out. That is not a fair picture of what we propose. First, the key feature of the new system is front-loading. The planning authority will reach decisions on key matters early in the plan-making process. The local planning authority will start by identifying and taking interested parties' ideas and views on all the potential options, and will then decide what it thinks best for its area. Its job is to devise policies and proposals for the development plan document for the area, fully involving the community in the process. Representations made to the authority on its preferred options will be considered by the local authority. No inspector will be involved at that stage. From that consideration, the authority will prepare its development plan document to submit for independent examination.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para31"></a>We believe that the local authority is well placed to do that. It knows its local area best. The procedures that we are introducing will ensure early debate and decisions. There will be a strong disincentive for anyone to put off raising controversial proposals in the hope that they will have a better chance of succeeding if sprung on people at a late stage. That applies equally to local authorities or others, such as developers, or if an authority wishes to avoid coming to a difficult or potentially unpopular decision. It will not be able to do that under the proposed system.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para32"></a>Secondly, the investment by the community and others in making representations on a development plan document, and participating in the independent examination will now always be worth while. There will be a positive action, and people will put investment into it. No longer will the community and <P>


<a name="column_455"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>others face the unjustifiable position in which all its input is taken forward through the inspector's recommendations and then ignored by the authority, which can do something entirely different. That would undermine our intention to give communities a greater say in plan-making and secure buy-in.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para33"></a>Finally, the independent inspector's job is to determine whether a development plan document satisfies the legal requirements on its preparation and whether it is sound. The starting point will be that the development plan document that the authority has submitted is sound unless there is evidence that it is not. Anyone seeking a substantive change to a development plan document will need to show that it is unsound without the change and that the change will render it sound. That includes the inspector as well. Therefore, changes that the inspector recommends will not simply be his view rather than the local authority's. The changes will be needed to achieve a sound plan and be tested against the criteria for soundness that the plan itself must meet.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para34"></a>If, as a result of his consideration of soundness, the inspector believes that the development plan document ought to be changed significantly, that can happen only if the examination is reconvened, or if the development plan document is referred back to the planning authority for further consideration. If there is still insufficient evidence for the inspector to recommend a change that he thinks should be made to a development plan document, he will not be able to recommend that change in his report. If that happens, the inspector will be able only to advise the authority of his view that it should revise its development plan document or prepare a fresh one to take the matter forward. Those principles will be set out clearly in the final version of planning policy statement 12.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para35"></a>The binding inspectors' reports are a key mechanism for speeding up the plan-making system. They are not a procedure for keeping the public out or for keeping out anybody who has views on a plan&#151;far from it. They are pulled in early in the system to get their five pennyworth, as it were. They are also a device for making sure that major changes are not sprung on the public at the last minute. We think that the system will be faster. We want the process to be fairer, but we also want it speeded up.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para36"></a>I shall give some examples of when an inspector may consider that a development plan document meets the test of soundness. The plan must generally conform with national or regional policy. That is self-evident. Secondly, the plan must be supported by a sound evidence base. It is important for the authority to provide that. The local planning authority must comply with its own statement of community involvement, and it must undertake a suitable sustainability appraisal and a strategic environmental assessment.
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para37"></a>The amendments are in direct contradiction to our policy on the issue, and I hope that they will not be pursued. I also hope that I have explained&#151;albeit briefly, because we discussed the matter in Committee&#151;that it is not our intention to use the binding statement to undermine the local authority. It <P>


<a name="column_456"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 456</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a test to ensure that the plans conform to the legal requirement, which ought to be possible for a local authority to produce anyway. 
<P>

<a name="40301-06_para38"></a>They will benefit the public; they will allow earlier involvement in the process; and they have the added advantage of ensuring that either a local authority or a developer cannot spring something major, new and controversial on the public at the last minute, when there is no time for it to be considered. In that sense, this is not a question of the creature of central government versus the democratically elected local authority. It is not that kind of arrangement, and I hope that I have explained the position sufficiently to persuade the noble Baronesses to withdraw the amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I want to ensure that I understood the Minister correctly when he said that the procedures for reconvening an examination in public are to be a matter of regulations, and that I was not wrong in thinking that they are not on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, there is a process to be used when the development plan needs to be changed significantly, and those principles will be set out clearly in the final version of planning policy statement 12. There will be no arguments about it. It will be written down. It will not be based on a hunch, a nod or a telephone call, but will be clearly written down in that policy statement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply and for endeavouring to persuade us so far that this is a matter simply to speed up the adoption of the document. Throughout the proceedings of the Bill, we have tried to make it understood that we are deeply concerned about the fact that the Secretary of State appears to play a significant role in all the policies from the regional spatial strategy through to the final acceptance of development plans.
<P>

<a name="40301-07_para0"></a>Despite what the Minister says, I do not see that for a local inspector to make recommendations that are then binding on the local authority does anything other than stamp the Secretary of State all over this aspect of the process.
<P>

<a name="40301-07_para1"></a>The four amendments are all related to the binding inspector's report. Amendment No. 79 may be deficient to some extent, but all four would withdraw&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness continues, I should like her to answer a question if she intends pressing the amendments. What would happen if a local planning authority refused to adopt a development plan with the inspector's recommendations? The inspector will have listened to the evidence and given some recommendations. The authority would be denying a sound up-to-date development plan document, which could be a disservice to its community when it has had an independent check on the soundness of the document. <P>


<a name="column_457"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 457</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>What would be the position, if that is what the noble Baroness is advocating, and the local authority decided to dismiss the inspector's views completely?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   My Lords, I have a case in point to relate. A planning inspector was appointed to inquire into a structure plan relating to housing in the Didcot area. He decided that 3,000 houses should be in one part of the town rather than another. The full county council took the inspector's report and on the evidence reached a totally different conclusion, which I believe was the right one. I think that the inspector was not really cognisant of the affairs of the area, and his judgment was based on what I would call a textbook version rather than an actual version of what happened. The county council chose the adopted structure plan in the end.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, am I not right in saying that, ultimately, the Secretary of State can overrule both the local authority and his own inspector&#151;for example, in the famous case that I believe was in Sussex?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the Secretary of State's powers in this Bill are essentially a longstop. Under Clause 21, there is a power to call in and approve the development plan document. But, essentially, it is a longstop power, which would be required only if there was a failure at the local level.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-07_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, for his intervention, in which he clearly made the point that there are occasions when the inspectors' recommendations are wrong. As matters stand under the Bill, there is no going back on that. The recommendations would have to be implemented, although my understanding is that the inspectors represent the Secretary of State in their role.
<P>

<a name="40301-07_para2"></a>I think that there is not a great meeting of minds in these areas. Our three amendments and that put down by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, hang together as regards the binding inspector's report. So when we read Amendment No. 79, we must read through to the end. On that basis, I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<P>

<a name="40301-08_para4"></a>Clause 24 [Conformity with regional strategy]:
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para5"></a>[Amendments Nos. 85 to 95 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 96:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 24.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-08_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40301-08_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Clause 24 is perhaps one of the most controversial in the Bill. The new powers it gives rise to are centralising to the point of control freakishness. It puts into law the requirement for local authorities to adhere to government policy by having general conformity to the regional spatial strategy, which sets out the Secretary of State's policies.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para8"></a>As a result the Government will have a level of control over local councils not seen before in planning terms. When the local authorities draw up their plans for public consultation, there are opportunities for representations to be made by members of the public. That is an essential part of the planning system. Yet the local authorities' plans will have to be in conformity with the regional spatial strategy. The consultation process during the drawing up of that strategy is limited and by invitation only. There is consequently a consultation deficit.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para9"></a>If we take the example of airport development, the Government said in their recent White Paper that they wished to see a second runway at Stansted airport. That policy would be laid out in the regional spatial strategy. At that point, the local authorities will have to cater for an extended airport, including making provision for the thousands of additional houses required that are also in the sustainable communities plan. But that is all presupposing that the airport and/or housing will materialise, prejudging the result of a future planning inquiry.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para10"></a>The essence of Clause 24 brings a raft of questions to the fore. Clearly conformity with the regional spatial strategy where it is the overriding document is causing concern. For that reason I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I will check with Hansard and I do not want to make a meal of this, but the noble Baroness gave the game away with her final sentence. She referred to the "conformity" but did not use the phrase "general conformity". The whole of her speech was based on the assumption that the provision is much more narrow and precise than it actually is. We covered the matter in Committee; I understand that we are in a new area, but the test is of "general conformity" and not "conformity". That means that it is only where a local development document would cause significant harm to the implementation of the regional spatial strategy of the spatial development strategy&#151;I shall read that again, because it is underlined and I must get the words right.
<P>


<a name="column_461"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 461</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para11"></a>The test is of general conformity and not conformity. That means that it is only where a local development document would cause significant harm to the implementation of the regional spatial strategy of the spatial development strategy should the local development document be considered not to be in general conformity. That is the end of the underlined section of the brief.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para12"></a>We shall make the policy clear in the final version of PPS12&#151;thank heavens for that. The point I am trying to make, in more colloquial English, is that we have to read the clause in the sense of the opening line of Clause 24(1),
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The local development documents must be in general conformity with&#151;"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-08_para13"></a>
followed by paragraphs (a) and (b). It is not a precision test, as the noble Baroness implied.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para14"></a>If colleagues do not want local plans to be in general conformity with strategic plans, we can have a debate and perhaps vote on that basis, but not on the basis of conformity with strategic plans&#151;it is general conformity. The point is that the principle of general conformity is long established. It is nothing that we have invented. It is the relationship now as we are before the Bill between the structure plans and local plans and between the Mayor's spatial development strategy and the London boroughs' unitary development plans.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para15"></a>General conformity serves an important purpose. It links the regional&#151;I shall leave out London, as there is no sense in repeating it&#151;level to the local level, ensuring that the strategies are translated into policies at local level so that they can be effectively delivered. As the detailed policies at local level will reflect the broader strategic direction established at the regional level, it reduces the risk of contradiction and uncertainty for people using the plan.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para16"></a>If we take the spatial nature of strategic plans for example&#151;heavens above, the example I have is the London plan. The London plan, for example, covers land use planning issues, but it also deals with waste management, social inclusion, energy saving, tourism and sustainability. The effect of those strategic policies will be greatly reduced if there is no requirement at local level&#151;where of course they will be implemented and where people will see the practical impact&#151;for the policies generally to conform with them.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para17"></a>The point is generally to conform with the policies, not a specific, narrow targeted area. People need to have the clearest possible idea of the likely outcome of a planning application. The supplementary planning documents will also be covered by the general conformity principle. That will assist people before they start their planning.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para18"></a>This is not new or something that we have invented. It operates now reasonably successfully. I do not see transferring it to the new system as a problem. On the other hand, if the provision made a change and stated that documents had to be in conformity with the plans, I would have a view to share with the noble Baroness <P>


<a name="column_462"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 462</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and I probably would not be standing here proposing such a clause, because it would lead to great difficulties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I said the words "general conformity" when I spoke to the amendment. Perhaps I swallowed the first word a little, but I hope that the Minister heard me.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para19"></a>I was interested to hear the Minister say that this is how things have been done in the past. However, we have not had regional spatial strategies in the past, nor have we had the very wide policies coming from those strategies&#151;and we shall return to the position in London in later amendments.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para20"></a>General conformity will be hard to define. What part will conform and what part will not? If the Minister says that it simply has to "take account of" then why does not the clause say that? Or if "consideration" must be given, why does it not say so? The words "in general conformity with" acknowledge specifically that the document will have to relate extremely closely to the regional spatial strategy.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para21"></a>I shall not take this matter any further today. I hear what the Minister has said, but for the purposes of this debate, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para22"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="40301-08_para27"></a>Clause 27 [Secretary of State's default power]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 99:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 15, line 14, after "are" insert "significantly"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-08_para28"></a><P>

<a name="40301-08_para29"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I return to the question of whether the amount of intervention&#151;in my notes I have the word "interference"&#151;from the Secretary of State is of concern to us. Amendment No. 99 seeks to qualify when it might be appropriate for the Secretary of State to become involved in the new development planning process.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para30"></a>At the moment, the wording of Clause 27(1) is decidedly vague on when the Secretary of State will or may intervene. The subsection reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This section applies if the Secretary of State thinks that a local planning authority are failing or omitting to do anything it is necessary for them to do in connection with the preparation, revision or adoption of a development plan document".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-08_para31"></a>
How is such failure to be judged? What criteria is the Secretary of State to use when assessing whether there has been failure or omission? We believe that there would have to be a very good reason for the Government to call in a development plan document. I do not believe that it is reasonable for the default power to come into effect if there is a minor failing on behalf of the local authority.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para32"></a>The amendment has been tabled to ask the Minister to spell out more clearly how he envisages the default power will work. Perhaps he could give examples of <P>


<a name="column_463"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 463</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances in which he would think it advisable for the Secretary of State to exercise his power under the clause. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, although I shall cite a few examples for the noble Baroness, the short answer to the amendment is that the Secretary of State has a duty to act reasonably at all times. It is unnecessary to qualify the reference in Clause 27 by adding the word "significantly". If a local planning authority failed to prepare a development plan document for an insignificant reason, the Secretary of State would not intervene. This is not something that he would do on a whim.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para33"></a>The noble Baroness asked me for examples. We make no bones about the fact that the power is deliberately wide and not restricted to any particular circumstance. There are numerous circumstances in which a local planning authority could fail to carry out its plan-making functions correctly, some of which I shall set out.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para34"></a>It could be a failure to prepare a development plan document to deliver the requirements as set out in the regional spatial strategy. It could be where a plan clashes without sufficient justification with national or regional policy. As I said in Committee, we accept that sometimes there will be clashes and contradictions because of local circumstances, but where there is insufficient justification, there would be a problem. It could also be where a plan causes harm to other areas, such as to an adjoining local authority area. It could be where a local planning authority fails to deliver the development plan document as set out in its local development scheme, and where the local planning authority fails to adopt development plan documents after an examination.
<P>

<a name="40301-08_para35"></a>These are instances where the Secretary of State would wish to use the default powers. I do not deny that they are sanctions, but they would be operated only on the basis of the Secretary of State being reasonable at all times. If the Secretary of State were to operate unreasonably, there is always the possible threat of judicial review. Further, I am absolutely certain that good legal advice from within government would be offered to the Secretary of State before he sought to use these powers, so that he could not be accused of acting on a whim, being party political against a particular authority, or reacting to a personality clash. Good reasons would have to be given. The examples I have given are the kind we envisage.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I am absolutely fascinated by the Minister's response. One of the examples he mentioned would be a failure to conform to the regional spatial strategy. We have just discussed at length how that is to be only a "general conformity". Now we must refer back to exactly what kind of conformity to the regional spatial strategy is required. If the local authority does not conform, or generally conform, it will be open to the Secretary of State to intervene because it has not done so.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para0"></a>It appears that Amendment No. 96, which I moved prior to this one, touched the edge of a problem here. The position is exactly as I said it was: the general conformity is in fact a conformity. Having said that, and having listened to the Minister's response on the other matters, I make no further comment. However, I am fascinated by his first response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 106:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 35. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-09_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40301-09_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 106 proposes that Clause 35 should be left out of the Bill. The clause requires local planning authorities to report annually to the Secretary of State on the implementation of their local development schemes, and whether the policies set out in the local development documents are being achieved. The clause also provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations prescribing what information an annual report must contain, the period it must cover&#151;presumably one year&#151;when it must be made and the form it must take. I really cannot see what useful purpose this clause or an annual report serve. We have here expressed, once again, the theme of the Government keeping an eye on local government.
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para10"></a>The clause would ensure that every 12 months, each planning authority writes to the Secretary of State setting out how it has progressed on its local development schemes, detailing how the policies in the local development document are being achieved. The reports will be more of those glossy documents with which we are all becoming so familiar, the expense of which must now be mounting into the zillions. Every single public authority is producing annual reports in all directions. I am in the health service and I know how many annual reports in the form of glossy documents are being produced.
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para11"></a>How much and what will the Secretary of State do with such annual reports? I understand that the whole purpose of the development plan process is to keep things moving and to hold reviews regularly. To produce an annual report simply marks yet another interception in the life of planning officers, who at the best of times are few and far between and will now have to set to and produce yet another monitoring document&#151;because that is all it will be. Further, most annual reports tend to put a glossy face on what is being done. This will be another example of that practice.
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para12"></a>The requirement will be an onerous burden, time-consuming, producing yet more administration and costly. I would prefer to see the provision removed, but if the Minister feels that it is vital perhaps he will justify <P>


<a name="column_465"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 465</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>its inclusion. In other areas of legislation, I know that my noble friends have argued that the Secretary of State should draw up an annual report on the workings of new legislation, such as the licensing Bill and the extradition Bill. The Government have answered that that would be burdensome and expensive. We ought to turn the turtle over and say that if it is expensive for the Secretary of State and the Government, it is expensive and unnecessary for others as well.

<A NAME="40301-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, one knows that the Government pay lip-service to reducing the administrative burden and the causes of unnecessary expenditure, and so on. How is it&#151;I think that I can understand how it is&#151;that Ministers let this clause slip by when the bureaucrats inevitably wanted to put it in? The bureaucrats want as much paper as can be produced on everything all the time.
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para13"></a>This is an additional burden. It is not a report to the people but to the bureaucrats in the department, who will be fully aware of what each local authority is doing. It is quite unnecessary and as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, there is a real shortage of staff, partly because they are scarce and partly because of resources. There is a real shortage of competent planning staff in local authorities. It is intolerable that the Government should propose something so totally useless and ultimately bureaucratic. I hope that the Minister will have no problem in accepting the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I am persuaded that the measure is red tape; there is no question about that. One has only to look at it and ask oneself what purpose it would serve and how much it would cost. I hope that there would not be glossy reports&#151;there would not have to be. It is probably red tape, though I would not say "burdensome" red tape because I do not actually know.
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para14"></a>If that was all that I had to say, then clearly we would accept the amendment. However, there is a problem. I remember saying this in Committee, so it cannot be new to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. The monitoring requirements in the clause and the regulations are not new. The work is being done now by most local authorities. All that the measure does is to formalise that practice, making it part of the new system and the effective implementation of the new development plans.
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para15"></a>That being said, I have to resist the amendment. I cannot rewrite the Bill on my feet&#151;I am not the planning Minister&#151;so I must be careful here. I am making the case for keeping the clause in the Bill because it does not impose a new burden. The work is already done by most local authorities. I would like to try to satisfy noble Lords, perhaps by letter, that it is not a new burden for most local authorities because they are already doing it now. If we had invented the practice from scratch it would, as the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford says, be a lot of red tape occupying planning officers when there are better ways for them <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>to spend their time. However, it is not a new burden or requirement and so I must resist the amendment. I will seek further information for Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, to remove existing burdens is a merit in government. The Minister ought to remove the clause now with the proviso that the matter should be looked at again, so that, if we really think there has to be something like this measure, we can bring it back again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   My Lords, the purpose of the Bill is to simplify the planning process and this is a wonderful opportunity to do that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister say either now or on Third Reading whether local authorities will be able to submit this information electronically to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, if they cannot then we will have failed with e-government. I am getting in real trouble here. I have no authority to accept the amendment. What is more, there are some things that I might go to the stake for, but I am not going to the stake for this. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. I am arguing the case for the status quo while he is arguing that this is a chance to get rid of some red tape. The local authorities do it now when they are not required to do it. One has to ask oneself why they are doing it. There is probably a good and useful purpose for which this work is carried out. It is important to monitor the best practice and what is actually happening.
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para16"></a>When we were debating another provision of the Bill I referred to a list of 29 local authorities which had not completed a development plan in 14 years. A small minority are not conforming to best practice. The rest are doing the work and on that basis the measure will not impose an extra burden. I will make it my business to check that it does not and get confirmation that local authorities will be able to deal with these plans electronically. That way there would be no excuse whatsoever for publishing a glossy report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-09_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I always like the Minister when he is just about tempted to foul up his own notes and everybody else's. I am grateful to him because he is honest enough to acknowledge when things are getting ridiculous. I suppose that I ought to take comfort from the fact that "annual report" does not have a capital A and a capital R, which would imply a glossy report.
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para17"></a>At the moment local authorities make annual returns to the department on the number of planning applications being dealt with, the time they have taken, and so on. However, at present, they certainly do not report on the implementation of the local development scheme, because it is not there. As I understand it, there is no requirement for a return on the unitary development plan. It may be that there is, but if there is not, there is no justification for putting this extra burden on local authorities because there will be a new <P>


<a name="column_467"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 467</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>framework for documents. Indeed, some local authorities' report on the local development scheme might simply be to say that they have not done it, because for the first three years they will not have to.
<P>

<a name="40301-09_para18"></a>It would be helpful if we were to return to this matter. I agree that it is not the most important part of the Bill, but it is an important aspect. If we were to return to it at Third Reading, perhaps the Minister might be in a position to say either that he believes that the whole thing is a bureaucratic nightmare or that the detail that will be required justifies the use of the description "annual report" rather than "annual return". I will come back to this matter, but in the mean while I thank the Minister for having shown some scepticism about it as well.

"( ) For the purposes of any area in Greater London, the development plan prior to the publication by the Mayor of London of a new spatial development strategy in accordance with section 341(1)(b) of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 (c. 29) (alteration or replacement) is the unitary development plan adopted in accordance with the principal Act."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-10_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment is grouped with Amendments No. 110 and with Amendment No. 110A, which is in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. It takes us back to London. In Committee I moved a similar amendment to the effect that although the Mayor's spatial development strategy&#151;called the London Plan&#151;will become the regional spatial strategy, it should not do so yet.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para2"></a>The amendment provides that the unitary development plans prepared by the boroughs will remain the development plans for each borough until the Mayor publishes or adopts an alteration to the London Plan; in other words, not the London Plan that has just been published. It is a good read but it is also a big read. Talking of glossy documents, I noticed that it costs £50 to buy. One would have to be jolly interested in it. If one tried to download it using e- government, I suspect that one would crash quite a lot of computers in the process. I do not dispute that it has got some good stuff in it but it does not contain the policies that the London boroughs had during the process of the creation of the London Plan or treat what was happening within the context of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para3"></a>The Minister's response to the amendment on the previous occasion was that the plan would be published before the Bill commenced. It has now been published, but that is not the point I seek to deal with today. There is no opportunity for the local authorities to be re-consulted on the London Plan now that the Bill makes its status clear, unlike every other region in the country which will have an opportunity to be consulted on the new regional spatial strategy. Noble Lords may wonder whether that is fair&#151;although, in <P>


<a name="column_468"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 468</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a sense, fairness is not the whole issue. We are also talking about effectiveness, whether or not the right policies emerge from the whole area of work and whether there is clarity in that.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para4"></a>The Minister also said that making regional plans a part of the development plan is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an important part of strengthening the strategic planning role. It is just as applicable to the Mayor's strategy as it is to a regional strategy".&#151;[Official Report, 27/1/04; col. 187.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-10_para5"></a>
He further said that the Government were not fundamentally altering the existing relationship between the spatial development strategy and unitary development plans. Since then I have seen certainly one letter which confirms this. He said in that letter that the Government were making the position clearer.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para6"></a>The Minister told the House that the strategy under the Bill would not replace Part 1&#151;that is the boroughs' strategic policies in unitary development plans&#151;and that the Bill does not affect the scope and content of the strategy. There is an overlap between the Part 1 policies of many boroughs' unitary development plans and the Mayor's strategic policies. While the London Plan is the most recently adopted document, I assume that it will have greater weight than the boroughs' unitary development plans. I am fearful that this will lead to more complexity and confusion in the process. Many of the London boroughs raised objections to the plan at the time but they were not aware of the status being proposed by the Bill and did not consider the level of detail included in the draft London Plan or the possible conflict that might occur.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para7"></a>I am aware of the different approaches taken by the London boroughs. Some have gone ahead with modifications to their current unitary development plans; others decided to hold back until the Mayor's London Plan was published; and some went ahead with modifications on the basis that the new legislation would be in effect, or certainly anticipating the new structure of local development frameworks and so on.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para8"></a>So what is emerging from the boroughs is very varied indeed. I have seen a number of such examples in my role as a member of the Greater London Assembly.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para9"></a>Perhaps I may give one example of an area of difficulty&#151;that of car parking standards. Noble Lords who have been involved in local government will know that the area of car parking standards can be very contentious. The London Plan policy states that UDP policies and transport local implementation plans should adopt the maximum parking standards set out in the annex, where appropriate, taking account of local circumstances and allowing for reduced car parking provision in areas of good transport accessibility. The parking standards in the annex are in many cases different from those of the London Borough of Camden, which prepared this note for me, and for other London boroughs as well.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para10"></a>The policy refers to local circumstances and reduced levels of car parking provision but this is open to interpretation and is therefore a source of potential conflict. The London Plan specifically identifies what is called the central activities zone, which includes part <P>


<a name="column_469"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 469</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of Camden, as being particularly well served by public transport. Camden is fearful that this can be interpreted to mean that other parts of the same borough, where there are different levels of transport accessibility, are included and regarded as suitable for low levels of parking. I hope your Lordships will regard this as but one of the many examples where problems could arise.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para11"></a>The Minister argued that the Government are not fundamentally altering the existing relationship and that currently the spatial development strategy can still be a material consideration. He also referred to the Mayor's powers of refusal. To me, this can be turned around and amount to an argument that the amendment I am proposing is not the problem for the Government that has been suggested.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para12"></a>I understand that the Mayor has been advised that now that the London Plan is published, borough unitary development plans and local development documents should conform with it. That is exactly the problem we are seeking to avoid. It does not seem to be truly consistent with what we have heard before but it certainly spells out in words of one syllable the position we fear will lead to confusion. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and to speak to our Amendment No. 110A. I should briefly like to explain the rationale behind our withdrawal of Amendments Nos. 109 and 111 and the substitution of Amendment No. 110A instead. We believe it to be more sensible to follow the current structure of the Bill by considering the issues for London under subsection (2) and then the issues for the rest of the country under subsection (3). Our earlier plans would have knocked out subsection (2) and then removed "other" from subsection (3) so as to take the issues of London and the remainder of the country together.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para13"></a>The Bill proposes to change the status of the Mayor of London's special development strategy&#151;known as the London Plan&#151;so the situation in London will be consistent with the Government's proposals for the rest of England. The London Plan will now have to be a formal part of each borough's unitary development plan when previously the UDP would only have to be in general conformity with the London Plan. This is despite the announcement in the planning Green Paper of 2001 that the Government do not propose any change to the Mayor's role in the arrangements for planning in London.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para14"></a>It is wrong for the Government to argue that the change in London is necessary for the sake of consistency. The situation in London is unique and this makes it unsuited for the planning system the Government are establishing for the rest of England. There will be no regional spatial strategy in London, which will instead have a very much more detailed draft London Plan prepared by the Mayor. It is a highly prescriptive document that will inevitably conflict at times with unitary development plans. I can <P>


<a name="column_470"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 470</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>give one example of this already. The Mayor is very keen on high-rise buildings and certainly there are boroughs in London&#151;of which mine is one&#151;where high-rise buildings are not part of the expectations in the unitary development plans. As matters stand, the local authority would have to conform to the Mayor's requirements. One can see room for all kinds of mischief there. The Mayor might like a nicer tower block somewhere in the centre of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, with its fine conservation documents and its low-rise buildings, would find that extremely unpalatable.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para15"></a>We are told that when a conflict does arise between a borough's plan and the London Plan, the more recent document; that is, the London Plan, will have the greater weight. That would mean that the carefully considered unitary development plan, which is a result of months of consultation with local communities, can be overridden by the London Plan. Indeed, the unitary development plans in London were adopted only some five years ago. What is more, there is every chance that the planning application process will become more complicated and take more time. That is the very reverse of what we understood the whole of the Bill to be about. Each planning application will have to be considered in relation to both the local development plan and the relevant policies in the London Plan. Any appeal procedure that results from the refusal of a planning application will consequently also be far more complex.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para16"></a>The amendment would retain the present relationship between the spatial development strategy and the unitary development plan in London boroughs. Under the present arrangements, the unitary development plans have to be in general conformity, but we now know that general conformity with the regional spatial strategy is actually conformity with the Mayor's spatial strategy. Section 304 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 amends the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to reflect the setting up of the revised administrative arrangements for Greater London. Section 344(2) states that Part 1 of the unitary development plans should be in general conformity with the spatial development strategy for the time being in force; and that Part 2 of the unitary development plans should be in general conformity with Part 1 and, in the case of a London borough council, with the spatial development strategy.
<P>

<a name="40301-10_para17"></a>All of that means that London boroughs will now not merely have to pay attention to but be governed by the London development plan. That was never foreseen and it was an eventuality for which unitary development plans were never developed. Under the current London Plan, they simply cannot be maintained.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, it is an interesting group of amendments. It contains amendments which would achieve slightly different outcomes. I can understand why the issue is important for London, but there have been some fundamental <P>


<a name="column_471"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 471</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>misunderstandings and perhaps some confusion too about how the system will work. I am pleased in the first instance, however, that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, appears to agree that the Mayor's spatial development strategy should be part of the development plan. That is an important point of principle. Making the plan that sets the strategic planning framework for the region a part of the development plan is an essential part of affirming its status and reduces uncertainty and ambiguity. That applies just as much to the London Plan as it does to the regional spatial strategies in other parts of the country.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para0"></a>However, I am disappointed that the noble Baroness believes that the recently published London Plan should not be part of the development plan. If it is right that future versions of the London Plan should be part of the development plan, I cannot see quite why the current published plan should not be as well. Making the London Plan part of the development plan is not a proposal that we have suddenly sprung on everybody. After all, the Bill was introduced on 4 December 2002. We wrote to the London boroughs in January of last year, before the examination in public of the draft plan, to draw their attention to that. The practical consequences of making the London Plan part of the development plan will be limited. We can perhaps discuss that in greater detail later on.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para1"></a>I do not accept that the boroughs would have made significantly different representations on the draft London Plan even if they had known from the beginning that it would be part of the development plan. I do not accept the view that the current London Plan contains too much detail to be a strategic development plan. Where the panel report concluded that policies were insufficiently strategic, that was taken into account in a final version of the plan, but there is absolutely no reason why the London Plan should not contain strategic development control policies. After all, London has a history of detailed strategic guidance; for example, the regional planning guidance on strategic views in the capital and on the River Thames. That reflects the particularly close interdependencies of a city compared to a much larger region. The Mayor of London is charged with preparing eight statutory strategies that must be consistent one with another. That necessarily means that the London Plan should contain a substantial number of policies. It does not mean&#151;as has been borne out by examination in public&#151;that they are not appropriate for the strategic development plan in London.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para2"></a>Amendment No. 110A would mean that the Mayor's London Plan would never become part of the development plan. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, explained, we have had a two-tier development plan in all other parts of the country in the form of county structure plans and local plans. From what I have heard, noble Lords opposite have not been enthusiastic supporters of changing those arrangements and have made common cause in arguing for a retained, strengthened position for the <P>


<a name="column_472"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 472</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>counties. I can understand their political stance on that issue, but I am not quite so clear why they should object to a two-tier development plan in London, but not elsewhere. The noble Baroness said that there did not need to be consistency, but consistency is an important element of the argument and the approach&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister accept that the difference between the London Plan and the regional spatial strategies is that the London development plan was consulted on and went through all its processes long before the Bill was promulgated? The London Plan has been drawn up against a completely different background. The consultation with the London boroughs was carried out against the background of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and not against that of the Planning and Compensation Act 1991. There is a difference. The London boroughs had drawn up their unitary development plans. Consultation took place against that background and not against that of the London development framework.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I accept that point. I think that I made it at the outset and explained that the Bill had been with us for some time. We consulted on it and published a Green Paper. It was understood where we were coming from in bringing the legislation forward. It is not a great shock.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, the Minister misunderstands me. The London development plan was consulted on well in advance of the Bill being put forward. Perhaps the Minister did not misunderstand me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I understand the point. I accept, too, that London is different from other regions, but not in its need for a strategic planning framework with development plan status. I hope that we could all accept that that was an essential building block of any sensible regional strategic planning system.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para3"></a>It is perhaps the case that concern lies more with the practical consequences. That seems to be the issue which the noble Baroness has raised more recently, but it should not prevent us from making progress with that important move.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para4"></a>The concerns that have been expressed are not well founded. By making the London Plan part of the development plan, we are increasing clarity and reducing ambiguity. Ultimately, we are not fundamentally altering the existing relationship between it and unitary development plans. The practical consequences of the change will be limited.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para5"></a>It is perhaps worth reminding the House that, under the provisions of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, borough unitary development plans must already be in general conformity with the London Plan. If the Mayor considers that the unitary development plan is not in general conformity with the published London Plan, he will provide a written <P>


<a name="column_473"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 473</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opinion that will set out the respects in which the plan is not in such conformity. That will be treated as a duly made objection. That is very similar to the arrangements included in Clause 24.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para6"></a>I turn to the arrangements for planning applications. Under the current arrangements, the London Plan can still be a "material consideration" when a London borough considers a planning application. The weight given to the policies in the London Plan will in some cases be significant. Making the London Plan part of the development plan does not mean that boroughs will be suddenly faced with a different set of issues to consider when dealing with planning applications. The same basic principles still apply.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para7"></a>The Mayor already has the power to direct the refusal of a planning application of potential strategic importance, if he considers that to grant permission would be contrary to the London Plan or prejudicial to its implementation. I wonder whether the objection to making the London Plan part of the development plan may be less one of principle or even practicality and more of&#151;dare I mention it?&#151;politics. If so, it is no good reason to amend the Bill in that regard.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para8"></a>A democratically elected Mayor for London has produced the London Plan following extensive consultation and an examination in public. Our view is that London needs a spatial framework. It is absolutely right that it should have development plan status. For those reasons, I urge the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, that was interesting indeed. I shall answer the last point first. The examples that I was given&#151;there were more than the one that I cited&#151;and the work in briefing both the noble Baroness and myself were led by a borough under the control of the same party as the Mayor. We are not talking party politics; Camden is a Labour borough and the Mayor is a member of the Labour Party. It is perfectly obvious to any observer that there is considerable discussion between him and members of the Labour Party about what goes on in London. No one is playing politics. I have been told that boroughs understood from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that the Bill would not alter the relationship between them and the Mayor. They may have been wrongly informed or misunderstood, but they worked on that basis.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para9"></a>As the Minister said, the GLA Act allows the Mayor to make objections to unitary development plans, which he said was not very different from the clause. Clause 38(5) is quite different, stating that, if there is a conflict, it,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"must be resolved in favour of the policy . . . in the last document to be adopted, approved or published".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-11_para10"></a>
The Minister also pointed to the Mayor's right of refusal. Of course that applies, but surely the point about that is that the Mayor is not left exposed with a London Plan of several hundred words that is worth <P>


<a name="column_474"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nothing. He should actually have the tools to do what he wants. What we are doing is not frivolous or seditious.
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para11"></a>The matter between us is whether it is the current London Plan or the next version that will kick in. The practical consequences are important. I am pulled in two directions over such an issue. In my role as a Member of the London Assembly, I do not regard it as axiomatic or automatic that I should oppose the Mayor in everything that he does. I cannot separate the different bits of my political life, but I regard the role of the Assembly as one of constructive criticism. I want to see planning in London work well, effectively, and not so confusingly that developers can run rings round the planning authorities by pointing out differences between documents and saying, "You've got it wrong. We're able to go in the direction that we want".
<P>

<a name="40301-11_para12"></a>I take what the boroughs of all three political complexions have said to me on the matter. Unless their fears were well founded, why would they make the points that they have made? I would like to test the opinion of the House.

I moved a similar amendment during a previous stage of the Bill and I asked the Minister then what other Acts would be involved, because they are referred to. He kindly referred me back to those that I had already mentioned and have just repeated. In the interim have there been any further thoughts regarding what the other Acts were? For the benefit of some enlightenment, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I shall try to provide enlightenment. Clause 38 defines the development plan in terms of the new and simplified hierarchy of plans and documents created by the Bill. It applies the definition to existing legislation. Under Clause 38(1), if any of the Acts mentioned specifically in Clause 38(7)&#151;for example, the Highways Act 1980&#151;refer to the development plan, then the development plan means what it says in subsections (2) to (5) of Clause 38. The same applies if there is a reference to the development plan in,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any other enactment relating to town and country planning".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-12_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40301-12_para11"></a>The broad reference in Clause 38(7)(c) is mainly to ensure that future legislation relating to town and country planning will be caught by those requirements. If the Bill listed enactments individually, the list would become exclusive and could be added to only by changing primary legislation. Clause 38(7) ensures that the principal current enactments are listed in terms, all other legislation containing the relevant reference is caught and the development plan is defined in one statutory provision&#151;Clause 38.
<P>

<a name="40301-12_para12"></a>I shall state a few facts. Regarding whether this makes life difficult for lawyers, we do not wish to be unhelpful but, if one uses electronic search facilities, one can search the UK statutes database. Such a search shows that there are 2,025 references to "town and country planning" in over 200 enactments. Furthermore, there are 295 references to "development plan" in around 30 enactments. It may be that there is a reference to the development plan in an enactment falling within Clause 38(7)(c), where that enactment does not relate to town and country planning. If so, then the construction provided for in the Bill will not apply&#151;but that is something to be determined on consideration of the relevant legislation.
<P>

<a name="40301-12_para13"></a>I hope that I have given the noble Baroness the enlightenment for which she was asking.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, the best enlightenment would come from saying that we probably need a consolidation Act if all that legislation is floating about. I now understand why they were not all listed on the face of the Bill and I thank the Minister for his clarification. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="40301-13_para1"></a><P>

"( ) Planning authorities may set targets in their development plans in respect of the proportion of the building's energy requirements on an application site to be supplied by renewable sources obtained on the same application site."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-13_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 114, I declare an interest as a non-executive director of a heating company.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para3"></a>The amendment would enable local authorities to better carry out their duties in promoting sustainable development through the efficient use of energy in new developments. I am grateful to the Town and Country <P>


<a name="column_478"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 478</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Planning Association for the formulation of this amendment. The World Wildlife Fund, the Building Research Establishment, solarcentury, the Somerset Trust for Sustainable Development, Queen's University Belfast and Oxford Brookes University held a sustainable housing forum. From that forum, there was a call for the Government to make clear that the planning system should be a central element in meeting sustainable development and particularly carbon dioxide emissions reduction targets.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para4"></a>Since then, there have been several examples of where local authorities have difficulty in this area. For example, extensive legal opinions were necessary before the London Borough of Merton unitary development plan could be adopted. The policy in that plan was the establishment of a target of 10 per cent of building energy needs to be met from renewable sources on site. This may not be the perfect amendment, but its purpose is to clarify that, in the interests of sustainable development, such a policy is lawful and should be supported.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para5"></a>In the Government's consultation paper, Planning Policy Statement 1: Creating Sustainable Communities, four main aims for sustainable development are set out. The last two of those are effective protection of the environment and the prudent use of natural resources. Section 1.21 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Policies should reflect a preference for minimising the need to consume new resources over the lifetime of a development by making more efficient use or reuse of existing resources rather than making new demands on the environment; and for seeking to promote and encourage, rather than restrict, the development of renewable energy resources. Consideration should be given to encouraging energy efficient buildings, community heating schemes, and the use of combined heat and power in developments."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-13_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40301-13_para7"></a>It is not often that the interests of two things that one is doing in the House come together. I am on the European Union Select Committee, which is investigating climate change. I am sure that the Minister will know that Woking Borough Council has an extremely good record on reducing carbon emissions in a whole range of ways. Last week, Allan Jones, the energy services manager in Woking, came to the Committee. I am grateful to him for his good definition of sustainable energy. I will quote it to the House:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Sustainable energy is anything that enables energy supplies to be made sustainable, either now or in the future, by putting in place such energy systems or infrastructures necessary to achieve a renewable energy future. A prime example of this is combined heat and power where the fuel may initially be a low carbon fuel such as natural gas which can be replaced later by a renewable fuel such as biogas, biomass or even hydrogen as used in fuel cells. The important issue here is the heat, chilled water and private wire networks serving buildings on local sustainable community energy systems which enables the easy replacement or refuelling of the primary energy generators some time in the future when fossil fuels become scarce or non-existent. Combined heat and power is particularly important since 70% of the UK's non transport energy needs are thermal and most renewable energy technologies are intermittent electricity generation only".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-13_para8"></a><P>


<a name="column_479"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 479</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para9"></a>The importance of that for planning is that the proximity of new and existing industrial and commercial sites to each other is vital. A community-led approach to such projects would be needed. Local authority understanding of that concept and pro-active assistance in developing it are important.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para10"></a>Woking adopted the borough local plan on 27 August 1999. There were three important policies in that plan connected with sustainable energy use. Policy BE6 was energy conservation:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The council will expect proposals for new development to take account of the need to conserve energy through appropriate location, design, layout and landscaping",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-13_para11"></a>
policy CUS8 was renewable energy:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Proposals for the development of renewable energy sources will be considered favourably where there would be no material harm to the environment by reason of location, appearance, noise and traffic generation, nor result in the loss of land protected by other policies in the Plan",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-13_para12"></a>
and CUS9 was combined heat and power:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The developments of combined heat and power stations that meet both the operational demands of the technology and the environmental policies of Local Planning will be permitted".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-13_para13"></a><P>

<a name="40301-13_para14"></a>Those are in the local plan. In practice, no developer has implemented any of those policies. The only people who have implemented any are the council and the public-private joint venture energy services company. However good everyone's intentions are, the problem remains that councils are often challenged when they try to implement such policies. I know that from my own experience. The heating company that I am involved with is in Southampton, and planners get edgy when we put forward proposals and ideas in 106 agreements to try to get sustainable energy into a development&#151;they say that they will be challenged and that they cannot do it. It is important that we get a lead from the Government on this to ensure that when people follow what we all believe to be right, they are backed up in law and that they are able to do it. It is vitally important, if we are to tackle climate change, and if we really want sustainable development. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, we all believe in the sustainable use of energy. We all believe that it is desirable, taking a careful balance of costs&#151;including environmental costs&#151;versus benefits in the greater use of renewables. The greatest contribution that can be made and has been made to the better use of energy has been through the development of building regulations over the years, which have been extremely successful. A remarkably few years ago anything went, and there were wildly inefficient methods of heating houses. Now, building regulations require proper insulation standards, double glazing and so on.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para15"></a>That is the right way to go. The noble Baroness's proposal is several steps too far. It is impractical and undesirable. Although I can see where she is coming from, I would not propose to have another overall target and an interference with the best methods that developers may feel that they want to use. The right <P>


<a name="column_480"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 480</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>way forward is further development with building regulations and not something like this. I oppose the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   My Lords, I rather agree with the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, but from a slightly different angle. The amendment talks about renewable resources, but 99 per cent of CHP schemes have nothing to do with renewable sources. The noble Baroness referred to the interesting things going on at Woking, which some of us know about, where CHP is used. Again, efficiency, which the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, talked about in terms of building regulations, is not covered under the amendment. The amendment focuses on a minute bit of sustainable energy and not on the wider picture. Frankly, it does not seem sensible.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_time0"></a><H5>5.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord on the issue of building regulations. That is the way to go about the change, rather than using the law. The idea underlying the amendment and the attitude is a bit like motherhood and apple pie. The weakness of the approach is, simply, that renewable energy sources, desirable though they may be, have one overwhelming weakness; that they do not produce much energy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, my response will be somewhat inadequate in matching up to the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock. I have a brief speaking note while the noble Baroness spent some time talking about the desirability of sustainable energy, renewables, the role of the local authorities and how the authority in Woking is tackling climate change. I was most impressed by what it is trying to do and I hope that other local authorities join it. I am sure they are because Woking cannot do it on its own.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para16"></a>The point most importantly made is that this is not the place to deal with a detail of policy&#151;important though it is in encouraging the better, sustainable use of energy and getting local authorities, providers, builders and so forth in the right mindset. I am drawn towards the points made by the last three speakers in this short debate.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para17"></a>We believe that the issues are best covered in guidance so that planning authorities can best set their own targets through their own plans and can vary them according to the type or size of development. Draft planning policy statement 22, which was published for consultation on 5 November, covers planning policy in relation to renewable energy. The public consultation period for that paper ended a few weeks ago and the responses are currently being analysed.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para18"></a>Proposals for bringing renewable energy and buildings within the scope of PPS22 along the lines proposed by the noble Baroness have been made in the context of this consultation. The Government will consider those proposals most carefully alongside the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>other responses they have received. We will soon be making an announcement about the results of that consideration.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para19"></a>I am grateful for the amendment being tabled because it is a useful and timely reminder. I agree with the points made by the noble Lords, Lord Marlesford, Lord Chorley and Lord Howie, because they are right in saying that this is not the place to make the change. It is much more appropriate in guidance and we can take it on board in that respect. Furthermore, being in guidance it will have more flexibility.
<P>

<a name="40301-13_para20"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness felt happy and satisfied in making good campaigning points in her argument, but will accept that the issue is best resolved in another way. We will all make more progress if it is and it is better that the issue is dealt with more flexibly.

<A NAME="40301-14_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who intervened for some of their comments and I thank the Minister for his reply. Various criticisms were made. The wording of the amendment is that "planning authorities may", so no one is forcing them to act.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para0"></a>Several noble Lords failed to recognised that if one is trying to carry out a community heating scheme of whatever type, it cannot be done through building regulations on individual buildings. In my view, in order to achieve the efficient use of energy, we need to go down that road when buildings are built close together. Criticism was made of combined heat and power not being renewable energy, but the point I made on the Woking scheme was that the advantage of having a community heating scheme based on CHP is that as new technologies are introduced the fuel can be changed. The other important point is that under such a scheme the electricity continues to be available.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para1"></a>The complaint people make about renewable energy, particularly wind farms, is that the power is there only when there is wind. Allan Jones told me that, interestingly, in Woking their scheme is so efficient that during a power cut when an out-of-town shopping centre lost its power, the shops in the centre of Woking retained theirs because they were on the circuit of the CHP scheme.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para2"></a>It is an important issue and I understand what the Minister says. I am pleased that the Government are looking at the matter seriously and I hope that PPS22 will enable local authorities, when they put it into their plans, to ensure that it happens. That was the point of raising the issue. People wanting to introduce such a scheme have come up against problems in making it stick and in getting people to carry it out. With those comments, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40301-14_para7"></a>
I am grateful to him for that and it was precisely why I spoke to the amendment then and why I am moving it today.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para8"></a>The Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A plan itself cannot achieve a sustainable development . . . It sets out a framework, but it is the actions that follow which lead to sustainable development. That is why we used the 'contributing to the achievement of' wording".&#151;[Official Report, 29/1/04; col. 333.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-14_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40301-14_para10"></a>I take the point that planning is not all, but it is more than just a framework: I would say that it is the bedrock. I agree with the Minister that the actions which follow lead to sustainable development. That is in part why I am moving the amendment. The clause referred to the exercise of functions by any person or body exercising the particular functions. I believe that they should do so not just with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development but with the objective of it. "Contributing" is inadequate.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para11"></a>Unless the regional spatial strategy in the development plan documents establish the right bedrock, not only will we not achieve sustainable development, but we run the risk of allowing unsustainable development. I would like to think that every objective is automatically achieved but I do not believe that that is the case in life. Nor do I believe that that is what the word would mean were it to be included in the Bill. I make sustainable development the objective with the hope, though not necessarily the confidence, that by doing so it will always be achieved.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para12"></a>I agree with the statement in the recently published consultation on PPS1 that sustainable development is the core principle underpinning planning. Therefore, I again draw your Lordships' attention to what I believe is the correct expression of that statement within the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, when we debated this amendment in Committee I said that we would look at the issue further, which we are still doing: the clause is receiving ongoing consideration. However, I am able to tell the noble Baroness and the House that I hope&#151;which means I expect&#151;to be able to bring forward an amendment at Third Reading which will go some way to meet her concerns without opening up every planning decision to a challenge. In the light of that I hope that we can let the case rest now and we will have a substantive debate on this issue at Third Reading.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-14_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40301-14_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 119.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para16"></a>These amendments provided for a very useful and interesting debate at the previous stage. I return to the two amendments that I put forward, seeking to have them put on to the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para17"></a>Since our last debate, the Government have produced a consultation document, PPS1, that sets out their interpretation of "sustainable development". I find it curious when we have had so much discussion on sustainable development that this matter comes to consultation only at this stage. It would have been helpful if that document had been around earlier. However, I re-tabled my original amendments to give the phrase proper definition. I maintain that it is crucial to get a definition on to the face of the Bill and not leave it to secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para18"></a>My first amendment provides that development should contribute to the achievement of economic regeneration. We all believe in the benefits of economic regeneration, and it is through the planning system that local economic regeneration can be achieved successfully. It is surprising that regeneration does not get a statutory footing in the Bill; we believe that it should.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para19"></a>We discussed the new clause quite extensively at the last stage. It was demonstrated that sustainable development was open to very broad interpretation. On the one hand, it can be perceived as a term that has environmental connotations, and on the other hand it refers to economic viability. The term can quite literally be interpreted as having meanings that are the opposite of each other. It is not good enough for the Government to give a vague explanation and say that a balance has to be struck. The term is too subjective.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para20"></a>Far more importantly, it is unsatisfactory for there to be no definition in the Bill at all of "sustainable development". There is a substantial subheading under Part 3&#151;"Sustainable development"&#151; but there is still no explanation of what sustainable development encompasses.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para21"></a>At the previous stage I put forward a new clause, which we debated, and I return to it because it seems that a definition that was accepted not only in this country but by the United Nations as far back as 1972 could form a proper basis for understanding what sustainable development is about. It is a definition that clearly has stood and will stand the test of time. The definition is quite encompassing and makes clear what would fall within the term "sustainable development".

<a name="40301-14_para22"></a>Although I hear what the Minister said about considering this matter further, I am not sure that he took into account that these amendments actually define sustainable development. I am therefore putting these amendments forward. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   My Lords, both amendments are concerned with the definition of sustainable development. I have not changed my view that sustainable development is a subjective concept and impossible to define objectively. However, since our earlier discussions we have had the draft of planning policy statement 1. Paragraph 1.13 sets out the Government's current definition of aims of sustainable development; these give some guide as to what the Government are expecting. There is also the element of flexibility in the fact that they appear in the guidance, which enables the concept to evolve with time and particularly with local needs. The question of economic regeneration is also dealt with in the draft document&#151;in paragraph 1.22. So I am satisfied for the time being that we understand what the Government are getting at and we will have an element of flexibility for reaction in different circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   My Lords, taking Amendment No. 116 first, I said in Committee that I did not particularly object to it but I did not feel that it fitted happily into this part of the Bill. That more or less remains my view. If anything, I am rather more adverse to having Amendment No. 116 included than I was then. For example, I do not know why the amendment talks about "economic regeneration"; if it talked about "economic development" that would be more sensible. "Economic regeneration" suggests that something that was not there is now happening. Perhaps that is a pedantic point.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para23"></a>The other difficulty with having "economic regeneration" in this part of the Bill is that there are certain types of economic development or activity that are totally unsustainable. That is why it is not very comfortable to have it linked to that part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para24"></a>I was in favour of Amendment No. 119 in Committee and am even more in favour now; that is, the 1972 Stockholm conference definition of sustainable development, which is still much the best definition that I know. It is better than the Brundtland definition, which introduced the word "need", which my noble friend Lord Cobbold rightly criticised in Committee. The word "need" opens up a whole new ball game for debate; as my noble friend said, it is highly subjective.
<P>

<a name="40301-14_para25"></a>A World Bank report on definitions of sustainable development listed at least 57 varieties of definition. In my view, the simple, straight, first definition of Stockholm is still the best. It is important to put it in the Bill because it gives statutory recognition to a basic framework which can be and has been built on in the guidance in the form of PPS1. At the same time&#151;"guidance" being more flexible than enactments&#151;it allows for changing attitudes and for development of <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister explain how the concept of sustainable development applies to one particular aspect of planning that he mentioned earlier; that is, waste management? Are there overall considerations of sustainable development that apply to the types of waste management used in the regional spatial strategies and the local development documents that flow from them?
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para0"></a>The Government have published studies that compare different methods for disposing of waste. They are prejudiced, if I may put it that way, against landfill and are trying to reduce it. The effect of that is that other types of disposal of waste will have to be considered&#151;either pyrolysis, which is supposed to be effective at reducing emissions from the incineration of waste, or recycling, which, so far, has not proved very attractive to local authorities.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para1"></a>The cost of developing recycling plants is enormous, and the Government are not giving local authorities any assistance with the capital cost. The rate at which local authorities recycle their waste is far less, perhaps, than the Government would like. For sustainable development, the ideal is that the maximum amount of waste&#151;household and other types&#151;should be recycled. That is the principle behind some European directives, such as those that prohibit the disposal of refrigerators and electrical and electronic apparatus, all of which must be recycled.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para2"></a>That is the direction in which we are going. Should it be encouraged in any way by the planning system? Should there, in regional spatial strategies and the local development documents that flow from them, be some ground rules that point waste disposal strategies in a particular direction? That does not appear in the Bill, and it would be an interesting illustration of how the sustainable development principle was interpreted in practice. Can the Minister say something about that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that it would be interesting, but, somehow, I suspect that it will not get into the Bill. I am not briefed to answer his specific points. The point that the noble Lord made that waste should be minimised in the first place in the design and packaging of products should be self-evident. In many ways, waste management should be part of the original design, before we ever get to recycling.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para3"></a>When I had a job in the real world as a production engineer, modularisation was not around. There were some items that we did not repair: we just threw them away and gave people a new one. That was in the old days of loudspeaker manufacture, which I was involved in in the 1960s. Today, simply to get the cost of production down, everything is more and more modularised, and repair becomes impossible anyway. In order to reduce the price and get economies of scale, they must build recycling techniques into the design. More and more, that is the way it goes. There are some <P>


<a name="column_486"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>motor cars&#151;I shall not mention names&#151;for which it is claimed that 95 per cent of the vehicle can be recycled. That is genuinely so and has been independently tested. That is in the design of products, before we get to waste management and decide whether to use holes in the ground.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para4"></a>I have some notes on the matter, and I hope that I can give some responses to the points made. I shall not use them all, because we will come to the issue. As I have implied, I shall table an amendment to this important clause at Third Reading. Because of the issues that have been raised, we tend to think that it is easier to describe what is meant by "sustainable development" in guidance. We could come up with a definition now, and, in three or four weeks' time, we could all agree something slightly different. I shall not argue the case between the 1972 Stockholm definition&#151;as in the amendment&#151;and the 1980 definition. I take the point that the use of the word "needs" in the 1980 definition opens up a can of worms.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para5"></a>We have produced planning policy statement 1. The matter is referred to not only in paragraph 1.13. I also refer noble Lords to paragraph 1.22, which sets out objectives that planning policy should seek to achieve. The first two are to promote regeneration and regional, sub-regional and local economies and to promote communities that are inclusive, healthy, safe and crime-free. There is a list of four of five other objectives in that fairly long paragraph.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para6"></a>The language has been carefully drafted, but it is not legally watertight in the sense that it would have to be, if it were in the Bill. I return to the point that I made at Second Reading: it has proved difficult to get a legal definition that we can be content with and does not open up a can of worms and prevent development. However, we have considered the matter again, and I am fairly confident that, by Third Reading, I shall be back with an amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para7"></a>The nuances that one wants cannot be put in a Bill. They must be put somewhere where we can use more flowery language and more words and the parliamentary draftsmen have not been able to use their techniques because of the difficulties. Our view is that guidance is the right place for a definition, not primary legislation. We can be much clearer about what we mean by sustainable development, if we do not try to encapsulate the meaning in just a few words that will be argued over by lawyers and others whose objectives for particular developments might be different from those of local authorities, developers and the Government.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para8"></a>On the other hand, we want to make sure that there is sustainable development, so there is a dilemma for the Government and for both Houses. At the end of the day, it is our responsibility to get it right, and it is not possible to do that by accepting either amendment. I rest my case not only on the document that we put forward but on the basis that the Government will come back and tweak the clause. I hope that that will <P>

<a name="40301-15_para9"></a>I am not particularly bothered about Amendment No. 116, which relates to economic regeneration, but I have become deeply attached to my new clause. It has been tested out with parliamentary counsel. It has been tested legally, and it would be perfectly acceptable and cover all the nuances that the Minister wants.
<P>

Fortunately, the snow has melted, but I must apologise to your Lordships for being unable to speak to the amendment, which I tabled for Committee, as ice and snow prevented me getting out of the house. Accessibility is subject to many forces, including the weather.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para14"></a>The amendment would put accessibility, inclusive housing and an inclusive environment at the heart of the definition of sustainable development. If the structured environment is to change, if we are to provide housing that embraces people, whatever their state, and if we are to create a country that makes a reality of the equality of opportunity for which our policies strive, accessibility and inclusion must be the default position in all development. They need to be seen to be as essential as the provision of light and air. Access requirements need to be enshrined in the planning law, not tagged on as an afterthought.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para15"></a>It will require a major culture change in the thinking of planners, developers and builders for inclusivity to be central to the planning system. That is why the coalition of organisations which back this amendment, including the Disability Rights Commission, the Town and Country Planning Association, Habinteg Housing Association and John Grooms is pressing for accessibility and inclusion explicitly to be defined on the face of the Bill as part of sustainable development. I look forward to the tweaks of the clause that the Minister has outlined.

<P>

<a name="40301-15_para16"></a>The guidance published on 24 February in planning policy statement 1 is welcome. But it will not in itself end the huge variation in the ways that local planning authorities address access to the built environment. Draft PPS1 is certainly heading in the right direction, and is helpful in relation to disability access, but the emphasis on the achievement of an adequate supply of accessible, inclusive housing and an accessible local environment as a central goal in the planning system needs to be placed up front.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para17"></a>The fear of the organisations behind this amendment is that the guidance will not ensure that disability access policies get the priority that they deserve and that planning inspectors will not have a detailed enough understanding to assess whether or not strategies and schemes have adequately addressed access and inclusion. It will be left to planning authorities to determine their priorities according to regional and local conditions. If they feel that they ought to consult disabled people, they will. If not, then their spatial strategies or development schemes are likely to overlook access yet again.
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para18"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to assure me that the Government will go further to ensure that inclusive housing and inclusive environments are enshrined as central goals of the planning system. Do the Government intend to insist that planning authorities and regional spatial strategies follow the Greater London Authority's lead in requiring all new homes to meet lifetime home standards and setting targets of 10 per cent of new homes to be designed to be wheelchair accessible?
<P>

<a name="40301-15_para19"></a>What is planned now will create our environment for the next 50 to 100 years. There needs to be a major shift in awareness and culture if we are to build a society that is accessible for all. The Bill provides us with the opportunity to do so. I hope that my noble friend can give me greater assurance that this will be placed on the face of the Bill and that we shall seize this opportunity. I beg to move.

I would find it hard to put it in as the only item spelled out in any detail. I hope that the Minister will tell us that whatever he brings back at Third Reading&#151;although it may be a bit early for him to anticipate that&#151;will extend not just to the general concerns that we all have but to pinning down how the issues that the noble Baroness has raised can be addressed through the planning process. We are all interested in the mechanism, not in fancy, warm words. It is much more important than that. Therefore, I support the noble Baroness, although I am not sure whether this is the time that we shall achieve it. I am optimistic that the Minister will help us to do so by the time that the Bill leaves the House.

<FONT SIZE=3>many complications to deal with in a simple amendment in primary legislation but it gives us a great opportunity to talk about it.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para0"></a>The opportunity to make our built environment, and our environment generally, open to people with disabilities, to people of all ages and all facilities, depends on us doing it when we are doing new build. It is as we renew something in a major way that we have the chance to make this happen. It is a project for 100 years. It is certainly a project for 50 years. We must take a very long-term view on it in order to make it happen. Making changes to existing structures in a piecemeal way is very expensive so we have to be absolutely sure that when we do significant new build or significant refurbishment these matters are taken into account. To my mind, that means that they have to be at the heart of the planning system. It has to be something that, beyond a certain level of significance in a development, people cannot avoid taking into account and which they are encouraged to take into account for even quite small developments. I hope that we shall be able to get something very constructive. We have got so many very constructive things out of the Minister that I feel embarrassed about asking for another one. I would be delighted if we were able to move in that direction and produce something in secondary legislation that met all the wishes of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, wherever possible we all support the view that buildings should be friendly to people who are disabled but I underline "wherever possible". It is a matter of horses for courses. If one were to read what is proposed by the noble Baroness literally it could mean that any building of more than one storey had to have an elevator in it so that people who are unable to use stairs could use it. It is clearly impractical.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para1"></a>On this general point, and on the role of government in legislating on this subject, it often strikes me as appalling that unrealistic obligations are pushed on to small schemes and small people&#151;restaurants, for example&#151;and that huge schemes or public schemes sail ahead with absolutely no concern for disabled people. The best and most obvious example to all of us is that of the London Underground system. It is staggering. Virtually no resources are used to improve access for the disabled. That is a much higher priority than this although, having said that, there will of course be housing for special needs of every sort, which is to be required and welcomed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. I refer to a mass transit system for moving hundreds of thousands of people. Have I upset the noble Baroness? I will finish on that point; I was just saying that I agree with the noble Lord's final point that the London Underground is a good example of a mass transit system that does not&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the Minister tempts me too much. We inherited the London Underground, <P>


<a name="column_490"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 490</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>but it was the Government's PPP project that has left us with an inadequate scheme for improving it. I am sorry that I could not resist that when we are talking about where responsibility lies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, that was all I was going to say anyway.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para2"></a>I fully accept the reasons why my noble friend could not be here previously but the one great advantage of the way the Bill is progressing is that I now come with more weapons in the armoury than I had before; a flurry of documents has been published. I emphasise that planning policy statement 1, published last week, is a consultation draft. It is not the last word. I draw attention to the middle sentence of paragraph no. 1.19, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Planning policies should address accessibility for all to jobs, health, housing, education, shops, leisure and community facilities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-16_para3"></a>
It makes it clear that development plans should be clear and comprehensive, with comprehensive and inclusive access policies. If the development does not address these issues, it cannot be sustainable. That would be our view. That can be put more easily in the guidance than in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para4"></a>A point was made about planning authorities, planning inspectors and others involved in the system. They sometimes make assumptions that the issue of access for disabled people is a matter for building regulations and not for planning. I agree. That is why we need to make it clear that we put such a high emphasis on design in Planning Policy Statement 1.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para5"></a>Good design must take account of all the needs of members of society, including people with disabilities. That is made clear in paragraph 1.29. As I said in a previous debate, I will be coming back at Third Reading with a bagful of goodies that will include the point relating to design that I made in response to noble Lords from all four parts of the House. That matter is actively being dealt with as we speak. We will be coming back on that. I cannot say in what form that will be, but I am sure it will be a form acceptable to the House.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para6"></a>I wish to make it clear that this is a consultation draft. Officials have welcomed discussions with the Disability Rights Commission and others on early drafts of Planning Policy Statement 1. Now that it is out in the open, there will be other comments and we are more than ready to listen. We need to look at it and ensure that we have made it clear for the policy makers outside. When we say that it is in the guidance and the planning policy statement, that will not be just a throwaway line. We must make sure we have made it absolutely clear.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para7"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, also mentioned the Lifetimes Homes standard being a requirement. I hate having to say things like this but it is in my briefing that an announcement will be made shortly about how the Government intend to take this forward. That is a wholly positive statement. We are on the case, and can come back to it at Third Reading. <P>


<a name="column_491"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 491</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I hope that "shortly" means between now and Third Reading, otherwise I shall need to have a better explanation then than I do now.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para8"></a>I am not claiming in any way that the statement we published in Planning Policy Statement 1 has overtaken events&#151;my noble friend could not be here in Committee or during the other debates. It is a consultation draft. The Government have put it on the table. We are more than prepared to listen and change the draft, if consultation brings that about. Some parts can be strengthened or extended to make sure that we get clarity and good information and guidance to those who will make the decisions in local planning authorities.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para9"></a>I hope that that is sufficiently positive. It is intended to be positive. I hope that my noble friend will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-16_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins: </B>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who spoke in support of the amendment. I hope that I am not disappointed by my noble friend's reply, and that his bag of goodies will include something that will be helpful to disabled people.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para10"></a>The current built environment and the state of accessibility to housing for disabled people leaves so much to be desired, and there is so much to be done, that the planning policy guidance needs to be greatly strengthened in order for it to be crystal clear to developers that this is an issue that they have to address. They cannot ignore it. I look forward to more hope later, but for the moment I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Best </B>   moved Amendment No. 118:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 39, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-16_para12"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "DIRECTOR OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PLANNING
<br>
(1) A local planning authority's duties under the Local Government Act 1972 (c. 70) with respect to the appointment of officers shall (without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of that Act) include the duty of appointing a fit person to be the director of sustainable development and planning of the authority.
<br>
(2) The officer appointed under subsection (1) shall have overall senior management responsibility for the functions set out in section 39."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-16_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the addition of this clause is supported by the Town and Country Planning Association and the Royal Town Planning Institute. It would require there to be an officer in local planning authorities with senior management responsibility for sustainable development and planning matters. Please note that the word "and" is needed in the title of this new clause.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para14"></a>The clause is intended to boost the status of planners in local government. Planning has become of ever-greater importance in determining the character, prosperity and quality of life in every area. The Bill ushers in further responsibilities by introducing a new <P>


<a name="column_492"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 492</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>statutory framework for planning related to sustainable development&#151;Clause 39&#151;which has not existed before.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para15"></a>As we know, the granting or refusing of planning permission on behalf of the council can create or remove millions of pounds of land value at the stroke of a pen. Advising councillors and communities on these sensitive matters would seem to justify the employment by the local planning authority of a statutorily recognised officer. This should not be confused with a statutorily protected post, which gives the officers some extra protection against dismissal from their position.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para16"></a>Statutory recognition is of a lesser order, but none the less signifies a status currently accorded to directors of social services, chief education officers, council solicitors and the chief officers responsible for finance. The Government have announced their intention to legislate for a statutory director of chidren's services.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para17"></a>Undoubtedly, it would help senior officers concerned with planning to hold their own with these colleagues if their position carried a similar status. As we all know, there is constant haggling over priorities and resources between the various chief officers and heads of departments. Planning deserves to be represented by an individual at a similar level to these other senior staff.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para18"></a>Not long ago, I led a DTI foresight group's visit to the Netherlands to look at their planning system. Planners there have not suffered the loss of reputation which has afflicted the planning profession in the UK&#151;no doubt as a result of major mistakes back in the 1960s. In the Netherlands, to say that you work for the planning department is a proud boast; seldom is that the case here.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para19"></a>Properly, the Government seek to up the game of planners with a £350 million injection of resources for&#151;in the words of the Minister&#151;the "culture change agenda". The Deputy Prime Minister has asked Sir John Egan to review ways in which recruitment, retention, training and professionalism of planners can be enhanced. His report will be published soon. To boost these efforts, the proposed new clause would be more than helpful to government in attracting high quality people into planning and keeping them there. It sends out a signal and it costs nothing.
<P>

<a name="40301-16_para20"></a>The wording of the clause is not controversial. It follows the wording of Section 532 of the Education Act 1996, which covers similar ground. Giving such public recognition, esteem and authority to senior planners can do nothing but good in helping the delivery of the Bill's objectives. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, our names are in support of the amendment. When it was first tabled I found it curious, because in my authority the executive <P>


<a name="column_493"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 493</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>director of planning is just that. He is on the executive board of the authority and is in precisely the capacity that the noble Lord, Lord Best, has suggested should be the case in all other authorities. It never occurred to me that this might not be the situation across the country. It is abundantly clear that it is not.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para0"></a>That is reprehensible. It must be proper and right that somebody who is not only properly qualified but also properly experienced in planning matters should be at the head of that department. If this requires a statutory framework for it to be taken for granted that that is the case in all local planning authorities, I support that. I am delighted to support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I take the points that have been made about the status of planners and the difficulties of recruitment and retention. As it happens, I was in Holland on Friday and met some people in the Amsterdam planning department, including a young man who was well qualified but was assisting with work on an informal basis. When we explained the difficulty with recruitment in this country, he said, "Where do I look? How do I come over? How do I get a job?". We explained the reality of the cost of living in London, but that was his immediate response. In London, we depend on some good planners from Australia and New Zealand, in particular, to ensure that staffing problems are not exacerbated&#151;or, as I read in a wonderful malapropism in a report last week, "exasperated".
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para1"></a>Having said that, we find it difficult to support the amendment. I examined the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 to find out what local authorities had to do when appointing officers and deciding on their establishment. It had never occurred to me to consider that before. Section 112(1) of the Act states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a local authority shall appoint such officers as they think necessary for the proper discharge by the authority of such of their . . . functions as fall to be discharged by them".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-17_para2"></a>
As the noble Lord, Lord Best, said, there are certain specified officers whom authorities must appoint, but, otherwise, the clause ended a previous obligation to appoint listed officers. That existed 30 years ago, and I wonder whether it would be right for us to seek to reverse the trend, as that change was from a centrally imposed obligation about who needed to be on the establishment to greater discretion.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para3"></a>Perhaps more importantly, would it reverse the entirely proper trend, or objective, of mainstreaming the sustainable development duty? The noble Lord, Lord Best, said that that is exactly what is intended to be achieved by the post. One could view that either way. In any event, we need to be better convinced than we are about intervening in the exercise of a local authority's autonomy in that or any other area. On the <P>


<a name="column_494"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 494</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>terminology of the new clause, I wondered what was in the noble Lord's mind when referring to the appointment of a "fit person". One would hope that no unfit person would be appointed.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para4"></a>Perhaps the Government can help me with something that was troubling me last night. However Clause 40 ends up&#151;whether the provision states "with a view to contributing to sustainable development", or whatever&#151;will the monitoring officer of an authority have a role if that duty is not complied with? My experience is the same as that of the noble Baroness. I should expect there to be a director of planning; I should also expect directors of other departments to have sustainable development very much in their sights. But will the monitoring officer have a role in ensuring that that duty is exercised?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Best, retabling the amendment. I have a wealth of notes about what we have done to raise the esteem of planning, resources and skills. Sir John Egan is considering those issues generally. But what noble Lords really want to know is what the Government are going to do about it.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para5"></a>There is also the point about giving local government discretion to appoint its officers. Certain officers&#151;finance officers, I suppose; and I think that there was another one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   Monitoring.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Yes, my Lords, the monitoring officer. That came out of the poll tax legislation, if I recall correctly&#151;the Local Government Finance Act 1988.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para6"></a>We have an idea whose time has come. We want to discuss it with the Local Government Association. We will contact it before the end of the week to discover its views; we have not done so yet. No one here spoke on behalf of the LGA as such. Education and social services are slightly different, because their services are directly related to individual persons. I understand the case for having someone designated in those areas. Nevertheless, their title does not always include social services; that varies between authorities. Housing is another such example.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para7"></a>However, given the thrust of the Bill and the climate of cultural change that we want, we intend to explore that matter with the Local Government Association. I shall write to noble Lords on the precise question about the monitoring officer's role, if that is acceptable. In view of that positive response, I hope that the noble Lord will not pursue his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Best: </B>   My Lords, I underline planners' appreciation of the Government's other efforts to enhance their status. In the light of those positive comments and the thought that the Minister's bag may contain one more such goodie, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para8"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, she has already spoken to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I have checked that this is debatable at this point and should like to make a short explanation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   This is an ego trip.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I do not think it is an ego trip. As a matter of courtesy to the noble Baroness and your Lordships, I should like to say a word or two about why we will not be supporting the amendment&#151;which I should have thought might be welcome to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   Perhaps the noble Baroness will change her mind, then.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, the Minister may persuade me to go through the other Lobby.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para10"></a>The Minister has already told us that he will come back to this issue on Third Reading. We obviously want to see what that offer will include. Attached as I fear the noble Baroness is to the amendment, life has moved on since the definition was composed. We could debate the issue at great length, which I shall not do, but it implies that other matters are excluded. I am now much more accustomed to thinking of sustainability in terms of the pillars of environment, social improvement and economics. Although I understand that the human environment could be construed as extending to those, it is not obvious that it does so. Each of those matters&#151;and, indeed, the conservation of natural resources&#151;is sine qua non.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para11"></a>The definition in Amendment No. 119 is not as extensive as it should be. I am quite attracted by the Government's attitude and approach, which is to allow for flexibility as thinking moves forward and to ensure that any definition is not so inflexible as to be exclusive and unhelpful rather than helpful.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para12"></a>I apologise if that was an improper intervention. I thought it right to explain it just before the vote.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-17_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I shall reply to the noble Baroness and start by apologising to her.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para13"></a>I am new to this place. I have been here less than three years, and I cannot get used to the idea of grouping amendments, having a debate on the group and then coming back to them now before a vote. I am used to the workings in the other place, where there is <P>


<a name="column_496"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 496</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more order. If I explained what we had just done to people in the other place, they would think we were barmy. We have debated that group of amendments.
<P>

<a name="40301-17_para14"></a>I realise that that may be the rules, or should I say that there are no rules here. That is the point. I am told that there is self-regulation. I cannot get used to the idea, but I am grateful for the support of the noble Baroness and her friends.

 "REASONS FOR EXERCISE OF POWERS BY SECRETARY OF STATE
<br>
The Secretary of State must provide reasons for the exercise by him of any of his powers or duties under Parts 1 to 3 of this Act."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_498"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 498</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-18_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 120 proposes a new clause which states that wherever the Secretary of State exercises any of his powers or duties under Parts 1 to 3 of the Bill, he should publish his reasons. If it is important for a local planning authority to publish reasons, it is even more important for the Secretary of State to do so. The Secretary of State is significantly further removed than the local planning authority from those who would be affected by a decision. Hence, the need is greater still for the publication of any decision that he makes. That would allow some insight into the factors that have led to a certain decision being taken. Where there is a grievance, publishing reasons would open the door to discovering whether the grievance was well founded.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para1"></a>Throughout discussions of the Bill, we have made it very clear that we regard planning as a matter for local authorities, which would have the experience and local knowledge to take decisions on those matters. In particular, regional functions, local development and development, covered by Parts 1 to 3 of the Bill, are areas where surely local discretion is a better way forward than excessive involvement by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para2"></a>While we appreciate that there may be circumstances where the Secretary of State has a role and should exercise his powers, in the interests of transparency it would be beneficial for him to give his reasons in circumstances where he exercises those powers under Parts 1 to 3 of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, in earlier debates, particularly in Committee, we made it clear that our approach throughout Parts 1 and 2 is that for the more significant substantive powers of the Secretary of State it is right to place a duty in the Bill to give reasons when he proposes changes to draft revisions of, for example, regional spatial strategies. It is appropriate that they should be in the Bill because they are very substantive powers.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para3"></a>A requirement for the Secretary of State to provide reasons for the exercise of any and every power in the first 39 clauses is not consistent with our approach. It would not be sensible or practical. Nevertheless, as I indicated in Committee and earlier discussions, we want to ensure that the Bill fully reflects our policy of giving reasons. Work is under way on that issue at present. We expect rather than hope to bring forward amendments at Third Reading. I therefore hope that that will satisfy the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para4"></a>Parts 1 and 2 are one issue, but the amendment also extends to Part 3. That is a matter which, currently, we are considering. I therefore hope that the noble Baroness does not press us again. A reminder was useful: but we are working on it and, it is to be hoped, we will come back at Third Reading with an amendment that will find favour because it goes to the heart of the issue. As much as possible, whatever the decision, we want the Secretary of State to give reasons so that people understand what has happened.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful for that reply. In his wisdom, I hope that the <P>


<a name="column_499"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 499</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister will see the benefit of including this up to and including Part 3. From what he said, I take it that this matter is under consideration. For the time being, I withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para5"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas </B>   moved Amendment No. 121:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 39, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-18_para6"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "HIGH QUALITY DESIGN
<br>
(1) This section applies to any person who, or body which, exercises any function&#151;
<br>
(a) under Part 1 in relation to a regional spatial strategy;
<br>
(b) under Part 2 in relation to local development documents;
<br>
(c) under Part 6 in relation to the Wales Spatial Plan or a local development plan.
<br>
(2) The person or body must exercise the function with a view to contributing to the achievement of high quality design in the built environment. 
<br>
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the person or body must have regard to national policies and advice contained in guidance issued or prescribed by&#151;
<br>
(a) the Secretary of State for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) and (b);
<br>
(b) the National Assembly for Wales for the purposes of subsection (1)(c)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-18_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, first, I apologise on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Rogers, who is in Shanghai. Perhaps he is recruiting some more town planners for the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I know that he would like to be here, and I shall make an inadequate substitute. Therefore, I shall not take long.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para8"></a>By and large, all my arguments were made in Committee where I was pleased to receive support from the Minister. I have been pleased by what he has said since. I think that I have even detected the Deputy Prime Minister saying some helpful things in the newspaper. So I am very optimistic that, if not today, at Third Reading we shall get something that will address the problem: that something is put in legislation to give local authorities the ability to withstand some extremely large and powerful contractors, and dare say to them, "No, take this away. Make it better". That is the position that we all want to achieve. I have great faith that that is what we will see.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para9"></a>I suppose that in a different system where there was a free market in housing and housing supply was occasionally greater than demand, which has not been the situation for a long time, developers might compete on the basis of good design. Under the current situation, there is no hope of that. We are operating in a shortage situation and always will be controlled by planning. I suspect that there will always be something of a shortage, particularly in some kinds of housing. Therefore, it is very important that design is in our system to control what housing is produced. It needs to be there in a way that gives local authorities the ability to stand up for it in what can be extremely difficult arguments, as many noble Lords said in <P>


<a name="column_500"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 500</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committee. When looking at buildings around us, we all know that those arguments have been lost on too many occasions. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, as in Committee, I support the noble Lords, Lord Lucas and Lord Rogers, in highlighting the importance of design in the new planning process. Since our previous debate I have had the opportunity to look at the Consultation Paper on Planning Policy Statement 1. There are many things with which I agree in paragraph 1.27 headed, "Sustainable Development and Design". Earlier, I spoke about sustainability and, in particular, energy.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para10"></a>I especially agree that quality design,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is a key element in achieving sustainable development",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-18_para11"></a>
and that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Good design is not just about the architecture".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-18_para12"></a>
We have touched on other issues today. The consultation paper states that good design is about functionality and the impact of a building,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"on the overall character, quality and sustainability of an area including resource efficiency (for example energy consumption).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-18_para13"></a>
For me, that is a very wide area.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para14"></a>I also agree with the statement:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There should be no acceptance of ill-conceived designs which do not contribute positively to making places better for people",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-18_para15"></a>
which was an underlying theme in our last discussion.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para16"></a>One of the things I feel sorry about is that in many local authorities design is not high enough on the agenda when considering developments. In other areas we see that despite the difficulties one faces when one tries to improve the design of a planning application, some local authorities manage it well. That can be seen by going around.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para17"></a>In another guise I was the Member of Parliament for Christchurch for some years and I admired the way the local planners had vision about how they wanted the town to be. In planning applications they involved local architects in creating a good quality of design in the buildings. Yet I have been to other places where it is obvious that no one could care less about their environment.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para18"></a>Over the years, having spent a great deal of time living in and visiting Scandinavia, I have become convinced that the majority of people's well-being is affected&#151;not all people; I have made the point before that some people see nothing around them&#151;by their surroundings. They certainly contribute to my sense of well-being. Many years ago I stayed in an awful bed and breakfast while in Cambridge visiting my first husband when he was a student. It was a dark place with a horribly dark bathroom, and I felt miserable when I stayed there.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para19"></a>In proposing the importance of design in the planning system, none of us thinks that particular architectural styles must be imposed. That is not what it is about; and I am sure the Government do not think that is what it is about. The places that we find attractive and that have endured over the years are usually those that have been well designed and planned. I can think of two that I mentioned on the <P>


<a name="column_501"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 501</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>previous occasion: first, brick flats in Millbank, built by London county council in 1901. They endure today and are still a pleasant environment in which to live. Secondly, going back even further, Lord North Street, which I walk down every morning, is the same. It is an important issue.
<P>

<a name="40301-18_para20"></a>I picked up some of the Minister's earlier comments that it is to be hoped that at the next stage the Government will come forward with something that will satisfy our desire to see design become an important part of the planning process, not just in some of the best authorities but everywhere.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040301/text/40301-19.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Alli: </B>   My Lords, while I have come late to the debate, I speak as one who recognises good design as important and as an important part of the planning process. As my noble friends Lord Rogers and Lady Blackstone could not be in their places today, I am happy to add my support from these Benches to the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para0"></a>Design should always be at the heart of the planning process; much was said about that in previous debates. The Minister himself advocated that route. Noble Lords have argued previously that design should feature in the Bill, and I agree. That would send out a clear and loud message that poor design quality is unacceptable. We should give local authorities that want to raise the quality of their built environment something that gives them the necessary confidence and support to challenge planning applications on design grounds.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para1"></a>Less confident planning authorities are often fearful of taking on developers on design grounds, not least for fear of litigation. A clear reference to design in the Bill would go a long way. Far from being a burden on planning authorities, such a duty to consider design quality would be of enormous assistance.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para2"></a>I am not advocating a definition of good design. Although I think that I would be a good judge of good design, such a definition does not belong in the Bill. That would be too inflexible. Useful guidance can be provided through policy guidance by government. A primary legislative duty backed up by genuinely useful guidance is just what planners and communities need. I hope that the Minister will aid our quest in ensuring that good design features in the planning process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, at a previous stage I made a small intervention to say that in my experience one was usually guided by the fact that design is subjective and therefore could not really be tested. I always thought it extremely strange that one should not be able to suggest that particular designs were appropriate for particular neighbourhoods and areas. The noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said that we should not be able to interfere in architectural design, but in some cases it is important that we should be able to do so, if a bad neighbour is building in a particular setting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I did not make myself clear. I said that when talking about design we are not imposing a particular architectural style. It is <P>


<a name="column_502"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 502</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not about saying that it always has to be a certain way. It is not a straitjacket, but that does not mean that architecture is not an important consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-19_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I did not express myself clearly. As I understood it, the point was that the architecture was important but it could not be the prime mover. Architecture can be and is important. The question of the internal design of a building is a different aspect, but the environment design is fundamental. We should look at what has happened to some of the large estates; for example, in my borough we have spent a long time trying to unscramble some of the vagaries of the 1960s. We have been left with large local authority estates with winding corridors and ill-lit places with many spooky corners, where no one is particularly comfortable. It is important that such areas can be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para3"></a>I support this move because it is different from those prevalent in the past. It would change attitudes in planning and therefore I support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I wanted to bring in the Sustainable Communities element. I have spoken privately to the Minister about it, as in Essex we are concerned with the Thames Gateway, Harlow and so on&#151;big regeneration projects where design is important. I know that the Government are keen to build houses quickly in many such areas. Essex County Council is very involved in the regeneration and redevelopment of Basildon; it has a team of people there.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para4"></a>County councils are often the only bodies with the people and resources to do that. In largely removing county councils from the planning process the Government might be shooting themselves in the foot over some of the design issues and the speed of development. Will the Minister comment on how soon we will know what is in the Government's mind about Third Reading? We might want to table amendments at Third Reading and we need to know the Government's position. Will he comment on the speed and the sustainable communities? It might not be the type of development and design that we would like, if there is not enough time to think and plan it and the right resource and the right type of people to help us do it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I take the final point, although I cannot be specific about the dates of Third Reading&#151;we will fix them as quickly as possible. We had an interesting debate in Committee in which I said that one way or another we would include design in the Bill. I cannot at this moment give chapter and verse on how that will be achieved. Three or four options are being discussed with the planning Ministers. We have some ideas about how we can bring it successfully into the Bill. I am optimistic that we will find an acceptable provision; it just has to get through the red tape and machinery of government. We will give as much advance warning as possible.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is right about the Sustainable Communities Plan. It will be involved in many parts of the country with some of the larger <P>


<a name="column_503"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 503</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>developments and in the housing renewal areas covered by Pathfinders. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment will be involved; that is part of our policy and why it received a substantial increase in its resources in the spending round. Although the sums were relatively small, they marked a gigantic advance in resources. We are determined to ensure that the sustainable communities programme will be sustainable and thus, by definition, will incorporate good design. Almost by definition, poor design is not sustainable.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para6"></a>We shall come back to this at Third Reading, although long before that we shall indicate what the Government intend to do so that colleagues can better understand the position. I shall be happy to put the proposal in the context of the sustainable communities programme and the other documents recently published to emphasise that this is a crucial part of what we are doing.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para7"></a>Although we are doing this anyway, given the strength of the debate in Committee, it has become clear that a provision ought to be put on to the face of the Bill. However, that is to be done while arguing at the same time that other issues should not be so included, and we think that we have a formula that enables us to do that.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_time0"></a><H5>7 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I shall not hold my breath until Third Reading, but the fact that we will have something at least a few days before and thus have a chance to digest and talk about it in order to decide how to address it is extremely valuable.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para8"></a>I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken, in particular my friend the noble Lord, Lord Alli, who is new to the debate. On such occasions it is most helpful to receive support from behind the Minister, who cannot turn that far round without getting a crick in his neck. I shall rely on the noble Lord and his noble friends to be present at Third Reading to cheer on their noble friend on the Front Bench.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para9"></a>I hope that the provision will be strong. I know that the draft of PPS1 is sensible, stressing that one should not seek unreasonably to impose a style. But there are times when that has to be done. If there is a concept of how a city centre should look and work, it will require forms of design that can fit within some form of tramline so that the whole thing works together. There is a difference between the city centres of, say, Newcastle upon Tyne and Hull which makes it obvious how much the spirit of a place is rooted in its design. Newcastle demonstrates an integration of style and layout that makes the place a pleasure to be in, both uplifting and grand. The same is much more difficult to say of Hull, which had the bad luck to be bombed flat in the war and rebuilt quite soon afterwards.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para10"></a>Not every local authority will produce such a vision, but where authorities do so, and it is one presumably shared by the local populace, it is very important that they should be able to have a say in how their town or <P>


<a name="column_504"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 504</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>city will look. One of the features of the past 20 years has been how cities such as Newcastle have reinvented themselves through design, developing an enormous spirit of place and time. Part of that process is the very important right to have the choice, when deciding how a place should look as it grows, to say, "No, that style does not fit this place. We want something in tune with our overall vision". I hope that we shall see a strong provision along those lines, and I look forward to seeing it. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para11"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="40301-19_para12"></a>Clause 40 [Local development orders]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-19_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 122A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 23, line 7, at end insert "and must provide reasons for that direction"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-19_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40301-19_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 122A, which may provide the Minister with another opportunity to give the House good news. The amendment seeks to provide that if the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales think that a local development order made under new Section 61B is unsatisfactory and give a direction for it to be modified, they should give reasons.
<P>

<a name="40301-19_para16"></a>I prepared this amendment before I received a welcome letter from the Minister saying that, as he had indicated previously, the Government are sympathetic to this point. However, I am not sure that I am reading the note correctly because it mentions "revoking" an order. It may be that I am being overly optimistic. At the time the Minister wrote that he thought the Bill should be amended to take the point on board and would table amendments to that effect at the next opportunity. His Amendment No. 123A seems to achieve that. I had hoped that the amendment would extend to cover the point raised in Amendment No. 122A; that is, the direction for modification and not only the revocation. Perhaps I will be able to tempt the Minister to take the point a little further. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has accurately predicted the outcome of our short discussion. We said in Committee that we had some sympathy with the original amendment. We have decided that the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales should be required to give reasons for modifying a local development order. We would in any case expect the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales to give reasons for modifying a local development order, but we will amend the Bill to make it clear that they will be required to do so.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para0"></a>We have also decided that we should make clear that if the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales revoke a local development order, they should again be required to give reasons for doing so. We shall table a further amendment in due course to give effect to that as well.

<a name="40301-20_para5"></a><P>

<a name="40301-20_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment will enable a development order to include provision as to the revocation of a local development order. We have already consulted on draft amendments to the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 which sets out the procedures a local planning authority should follow when revoking a local development order. For example, we want to prescribe the publicity arrangements a local planning authority should follow should it revoke a local development order.

<a name="40301-20_para7"></a>We decided that the Bill as drafted did not enable us to provide for this in a development order. This amendment will put that right. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 25, line 11, leave out "must" and insert "may"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-20_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40301-20_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 124, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 125, 126, 127 and 129 in the group. These amendments aim to give more discretion to local authorities in the issue of statements of development principles. They will prevent the provision of statements of development principles from placing an undue burden on local planning authorities and will allow authorities to refuse to grant a statement of development principles on the basis of insufficient information.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para12"></a>When I spoke to these amendments in Committee, I did not feel that the Government had truly got to grips with the concerns we sought to express. Amendment No. 124 aims to give local authorities more discretion in the issue of statements of development principles than is proposed in the Bill. Amendments Nos. 126 and 127 are complementary to that aim in that they support specific aspects of local authorities' discretion. These three amendments would enable local authorities to decline to issue statements of development principles on the basis of insufficient information.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para13"></a>Amendment No. 125 is a probing amendment which simply seeks clarification from the Government on whether it will be local authorities which ultimately decide whether the development plan is material to the request for a statement of development principles.
<P>


<a name="column_506"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 506</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para14"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 129 is a probing amendment designed to test the Government's thinking on how they propose to minimise the level of deliberate frustration within the planning system. Further, if Amendment No. 124 is accepted, Clause 42(5) would in any case be unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para15"></a>We strongly believe that the Government have not yet made the case for how statements of development principles will add value to the planning system in this country. In Committee, the Minister said that the Government were placing increasing emphasis on the importance of pre-application discussions. The formalisation of this through statements of development principles may provide developers and local authorities with an additional tool for building up an agreed development prospectus for a site. Nevertheless, the Government should explain exactly how they envisage statements of development principles working on the ground.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para16"></a>We think that statements of development principles are a classic example of something that seems like a good idea in theory but is actually a major headache when it comes to implementation&#151;and can even be counter-productive. There will be an unnecessary burden on local authorities and it is not clear how they will achieve greater transparency in the pre-application process. The statements risk becoming a major bureaucratic process in their own right.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para17"></a>As far as I can see, there is no discernible benefit to applicants, local planning authorities or the public. If the overall aim is to address the weaknesses associated with outline planning permission, why not address those problems directly, for example by encouraging discussions in the application process between developers and planning departments?
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para18"></a>The interested organisations that I have spoken to, including the Council for the Protection of Rural England and London First, as well as many other professional planners, have all spoken out against statements of development principles. There simply is no support for them. Amendments Nos. 124 and 126 are aimed at ensuring that local planning authorities will not feel compelled to approve or refuse applications when they simply do not have sufficient evidence by which to judge the merits of an application. This could happen because, as the Bill currently stands, there is no provision to allow the local authority to decline a request to issue a statement of development principles on the grounds of insufficient information. Hundreds of people will ask for these statements&#151;people are very confused about it&#151;and that could lead to a tremendous workload for a department that could not cope with it.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para19"></a>Local authorities may be put in the position where they do not have enough confidence in their legal position to say that the application is entirely unacceptable, which I believe is the only grounds on which they can decline to issue a statement of development principles. However, they may also feel that they have not been provided with sufficient information, such as information on design or infrastructure, on which to base their decisions. As <P>


<a name="column_507"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 507</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>organisations such as CPRE have pointed out, this would put pressure on local authorities to issue statements of development principles that agree with the proposed developments and then spend valuable time and resources trying to decide what safeguards and conditions should be placed on them to meet any eventuality.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para20"></a>The Minister said in Committee that if insufficient information were provided, the statement of development principles would be correspondingly general. However, if is to be so general as to be meaningless, why have it? A statement of development principles will be an important material consideration in the final decision on the planning permission. We therefore need to give local authorities more discretion on how they issue them.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para21"></a>Amendment No. 127 addresses our concerns that the statement of development principles does not have to take into account whether the proposed development would require an environmental impact assessment. We are aware that the Government have stated that because the statement of development principles does not itself grant consent to allow a development to go ahead, an environmental impact assessment is not a requirement. However, we would like a reassurance from the Minister that this arrangement, whereby the principle of a development has been agreed prior to the outcome of an environmental impact assessment, will not undermine the integrity of the environmental impact assessment and its capacity to reach a different conclusion from that reached in the statement of development principles.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para22"></a>As I already mentioned, with regard to the workload of planning departments, we also believe that statements of development principles would mark an unacceptable shift in the burden of planning applications from the applicant to the local authority. This is not just an argument about planning authorities having insufficient information and then dealing with the consequences. We are also raising it because the number of requests for statements of development principles will be much higher than that of outline planning applications. This flows from the fact that anybody can ask the local authority for a statement of development principles.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para23"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 129 I would like some reassurance from the Minister that the new procedures for statements of development principles will not be used as a spoiling tactic to frustrate legitimate development. This could certainly happen, given that anyone will be able to request a statement of development principles. Our concern is that in some circumstances local authorities might be asked to determine requests for statements of development principles before the information upon which requests could be judged is available.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para24"></a>Clause 42 states that a local authority "may" decline to issue a statement of development principles before the end of the two-year period if it disagrees with the principles of the development. However, as I understand it, a local planning authority could quite <P>


<a name="column_508"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 508</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legitimately issue a new statement of development principles that agrees with a development proposal before the end of the two-year period.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para25"></a>Is subsection (5) a mechanism through which to deal with any potential exploitation of statements of development principles by those who just want to stop all development regardless of its benefits? If it is, it is still unfair that the burden falls on planning departments. I wish that the noble Lord, Lord Winston were here. I am not in favour of cloning, but I have been thinking during this series of debates that we should be able to clone planners. It is possibly the only way forward.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para26"></a>I believe that deleting Clause 42(5) would be in line with the preceding amendments. The fundamental point of those amendments is that it would be much simpler and more democratic to give a local planning authority the discretion to decide whether to issue statements of development principles in respect of a particular development.

<A NAME="40301-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock and I have put our names to a number of these amendments. We very much support what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield said. It is hard to find anyone who supports the direction taken by the Government on this matter. If that sounds too harsh, conversely we support the Government's consideration of whether outline planning permission should be required to include more detail. As I understood it, that was one of the Government's considerations when considering whether to abolish outline planning permission. I cannot think about statements of development principles without at the same time thinking about outline planning permission, which is why I put the two together.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para27"></a>We need to know from the Minister how the thinking and the consultation on this matter is progressing and when decisions might be taken. I am very uneasy about deciding legislation when we know that there are other ideas in the pipeline and the Government are looking to leave their options open through primary legislation. I am not at all comfortable with that. I can see that I am not alone in that view, but Hansard will not know who nodded in agreement.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para28"></a>We have talked about the problems with outline permissions and the lesson that more detail is necessary. One has that in spades in the case of statements of development principles. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield talked about the increase in workload that this provision forebodes for local planning authorities. A part of this will be to consider how they will deal with requests for statements when they will more or less have to compose the application, or, at any rate, understand what the application for the statement in itself implies.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para29"></a>I did not mean to add our names to Amendment No. 125. I accepted at the previous stage that it was not the best of the amendments on offer. I wanted to add our <P>


<a name="column_509"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 509</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>names to Amendment No. 126, which refers to "sufficient information". I accept the point made by the Minister at the previous stage that the amendment in itself is ineffective to achieve what we are arguing about. However, it makes the point.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para30"></a>As to Amendment No. 127, the Minister said at the previous stage that the matter would be dealt with in secondary legislation. Perhaps he will explain today where there is a regulation-making power relating to proposed new Section 61E. It may be in the 1990 Act or it may be one of the matters that I have not identified correctly. However, if the Government are relying in their arguments on the fact that regulations may be made to achieve some of what we are seeking, I should like to be assured as to the mechanism for making the regulations. It may be that the power is within subsection (7) of new Section 61E, which refers to a development order, but it is not immediately obvious to me that that is the case.
<P>

<a name="40301-20_para31"></a>The noble Lord also referred to the delays inherent in this process because of its somewhat amorphous nature. That would go wholly against what the Government are trying to achieve. Abolishing outline permission would leave developers without the certainty they want and the fundable permission they need. As I say, no one seems to support the process except those who have composed statements of development principles. Perhaps the Minister can also explain what support there has been from outside Parliament to give the Government the confidence to include this in the Bill in the first place.

<A NAME="40301-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I support what my noble friends have said. I hope that, in replying, the Minister will look across the Dispatch Box at my two noble friends on the Front Bench and notice that my noble friend Lord Hanningfield is worried about his planning department being overburdened and that my noble friend Lady Hanham has no worries at all about her parking control department being overburdened. In fact, travelling her streets, it is easier to get away from flies in Australia than traffic wardens in Chelsea. That is because there is a proper rate of charging for traffic wardens in Chelsea. You pay £3 a minute in the better areas&#151;or, rather, £3 an hour; £3 a minute would be high even for Chelsea. My noble friend stings her customers royally and runs the division at a profit.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para0"></a>The difficulty with planning departments is that the fees have been so low for so long that we cannot pay planners properly nor staff the departments properly. We have to go to Australia to find staff because no one wants to train to be a planner. To reverse this, we need a proper level of fees. Whatever the merits of these statements&#151;the noble Lord knows that I think they are a lovely idea but they will never fly; they are not right&#151;if we are going to have them, let us charge a proper level of fees. If we charge a decent level of fees we will be able to afford the planning departments to deal with them and people will not feel like chucking in applications on the willy-nilly; they will wait and think carefully if they are going to be done for a thousand or two for making one of these applications.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para1"></a>There is a lot to be said for getting fees on a proper level. If we do that, many of the fears we have about overburdening the system will disappear because we will be funding it properly and it will simply be a question of running it well rather than trying to imagine how you will deal with ever increasing burdens inside a shrinking budget.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I hesitate to assure my noble friend that if there was any question of these statements of development principles coming into being, there is no doubt that the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea would ensure that proper fees were charged and that we made sufficient money out of the system.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para2"></a>I reinforce what has been said about the outline planning permission. At the moment it looks like the Government are minded to ditch it in favour of the statement of development principles, which is a very poor substitute. Outline planning permission has served not only local authorities but also developers extremely well over the years. It provides the "bankability" of a scheme. The statement of development principles will not do that. There is no way that any bank will put forward money for a developer on the back of a statement of development principles. All it is likely to do is cause confusion within the network of development proposals. We shall end up with endless statements of development principles on innumerable properties where there is no intention of developing them. It will be easy to ask for one and this will cause a need for extra planning officers.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para3"></a>In my borough we shall ensure that we make something from it, but I very much hope that we shall not have to do so.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, this is an important issue. I am conscious of the hour but I must stick to my notes on this. I shall not use everything I have got, but I want to give substantive answers given the fact that discussions are ongoing.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para4"></a>I wish to get two specific issues out of the way first so that I do not forget to raise them. We shall be consulting in the summer of this year on a proposed fee regime for statements of development principles; and, in answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, the power to make a development order under new Section 61E(7) is contained in Section 59 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which is why, I suspect, she could not find it.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 124 and 126 together would give the local planning authority discretion on whether or not to decide to issue a statement of development principles. In our previous debate I stated that where an application for a statement of development principles is received, a local planning authority should be required to come to a decision regardless of the level of information provided.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para6"></a>It should not be discretionary to provide this kind of advice. I do not see how that would help the overall process. If a developer asks for advice on a proposed <P>


<a name="column_511"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 511</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>development through a statement of development principles he should be entitled to receive a response. We have said previously that a minimum amount of information will be necessary to identify where the proposed development will be and the person making the request for a statement of development principles. We do not wish to make it compulsory to provide other details.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para7"></a>If the request for a statement of development principles lacks information on some aspects of the development, the statement of development principles issued by the local planning authority will say so. We want statements of development principles to be flexible enough for both simple and complex questions to be asked. It should not be compulsory for a developer to submit as much information with a statement of development principles as he would for a planning application.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para8"></a>As to Amendment No. 125&#151;I have heard a partial apology for it&#151;as I said before, we do not believe the amendment is necessary. The provision mirrors existing requirements&#151;for instance, where local planning authorities are required to have regard to the development plan as far as it is material to the determination of the planning application. There can be no need to have regard to the development plan if it is not material to the application. It will be for the local planning authority to decide whether or not it thinks the development plan is material to the application.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para9"></a>As to Amendment No. 127, we recognise the importance an environmental impact assessment has in the planning system but we do not believe that it is necessary to include specific requirements on environmental impact assessments on the face of the Bill. It is important to remember that a request for a statement of development principles is not an application for planning permission. If a positive statement of development principles is granted, it is not in any form a consent for planning permission. It is simply a way of finding out whether a development might be suitable for a particular site and of identifying the kind of issues that a developer would need to consider before he submits an application for planning permission.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para10"></a>As I have already pointed out, it follows that we do not want to require developers to submit as much detail with a request for a statement of development principles as we would for a planning application. The statement of development principles would take place at an early stage. At that early stage, it is unlikely that there will always be sufficient information available to enable all the likely significant environmental impacts to be identified. In those circumstances, it would be difficult for the local planning authority to make a proper screening opinion on the need for an environmental impact assessment.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para11"></a>Moreover, if the amount of detail required to carry out a screening opinion is available, the developer may be more likely to apply for outline planning permission. Nevertheless, if on the available information, the local planning authority considers <P>


<a name="column_512"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 512</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the nature of the proposed development is one for which an environmental impact assessment might be required under the relevant regulations, the statement of development principles that it issues will indicate that any application for planning permission in respect of development agreed to in principle might be subject to the provision of an environmental statement with any subsequent application. If it is not apparent that an environmental impact assessment is required when the statement of development principles is issued, the local planning authority will still be able to require one when the application for planning permission is submitted if it is then evident that one is required.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para12"></a>In respect of Amendment No. 129, Clause 61E(5) would allow a local planning authority to decline to issue a statement of development principles where a valid statement of development principles has already been issued. Its chief aim is to protect the local planning authority from duplicating work that it has already done. The removal of subsection (5) would result in the local planning being required to consider every request it receives for a statement of development principles, whether or not it has already considered an identical one. I cannot see the value of requiring a local planning authority and those consulted about a statement of development principles to go through a process they have already been through.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para13"></a>As I explained in Committee, Clause 61E(5) does not prevent a local planning authority from reconsidering a request for a statement of development principles if it has been revised to address the reasons why a previous statement of development principles, or part of one, had been disagreed with.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para14"></a>Amendments Nos. 147 and 150 would retain outline planning permission in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. We discussed those amendments in Committee. On 29 January, we said that we were considering the retention of outline planning permission as set out in a Written Statement by the planning Minister, Keith Hill, on 15 December 2003. Retention would be on the basis that applications for outline planning permission met our objectives. Those objectives are that outline planning permission provides the opportunity for greater community involvement and a level of information that enables local authorities to assess all the significant environmental impacts from the proposed developments.
<P>

<a name="40301-21_para15"></a>The Minister also stated on 15 December that the further information that should accompany applications for outline planning permission would need to cover the key design principles. As I have again confirmed today, we indicated that we would include the word "design" in the Bill. We also said in earlier debates that discussions with representatives of interested parties, including the development industry, were continuing. Those discussions have continued since 29 January in a positive and constructive manner. The concept of a statement of design principles is part of the discussion. The British <P>

The Government still need to be satisfied that the information will meet our objectives, including the opportunity for greater community involvement. I hope that we will be able to comment further soon on outline planning permission. I cannot clarify whether "comment further soon" means before or after Third Reading, but it is clear that I will need to take the matter further at Third Reading than has been the case tonight. However, discussions with interested parties are continuing in the way that I have described. That is why we cannot agree to the amendments. I therefore hope that my detailed run-through of our current position on all the amendments&#151;although it has not been as detailed as it could have been&#151;will satisfy all noble Lords this evening. As I have said, we will return to the matter at Third Reading.

<A NAME="40301-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, the second part of the Minister's answer was rather better than the first. To a lot of people who are involved with the matter in the outside world, the statement of development principles is almost the most unpopular part of the whole legislation. As my noble friend Lady Hanham and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, developers depend on planning applications to resource the funding for development. Outline planning permission has moved on considerably in the past few years. So much work is done on outline planning permissions for major developments now that they are almost statements of development principles. Therefore, the second part of the Minister's answer, about the planning Minister's Written Statement, was helpful.
<P>

<a name="40301-22_para0"></a>However, on the first part, I perhaps did not make all my points clearly enough. Everyone is concerned that we will see a lot of requests for statements of development principles by people who want to abort or stop development. The Minister spoke about developers making applications for statements. We are concerned about the hundreds of other people who do not want to develop anything, but who want to stop development or merely to find out what might happen to a particular field next to their house. The Government have not taken that on board. It is a matter not only of developers applying for statements, but of all the other people applying for them too.
<P>

<a name="40301-22_para1"></a>It is important that the Minister clarifies the Government's position before Third Reading, because it is a difficult part of the legislation. I repeat that all the professional bodies that I have met in the outside world are extremely concerned. It is the outside world that has to make the legislation work once it is in place. It needs a lot more reassurance. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) The authority shall carry out an environmental assessment under Directive 2001/42/EC of proposed development consisting of projects listed in Annexes I and II to Directive 85/337/EC where they are likely to have significant effects on the environment prior to issuing a statement of development principles."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-22_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the strategic environment assessment directive, which comes into force in July 2004, requires environmental assessment to be carried out of plans and programmes, including those which,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"set the framework for future development consent of projects".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-22_para8"></a>
The Government accept that the directive applies to the RSS and local development plans. They have not addressed whether it applies to statements of development principles. The consultation on secondary legislation for statements of development principles does not mention the issue, and the Government's Strategic Environment Assessment Directive: Guidance for Planning Authorities, published in 2003, does not mention the plans.
<P>

<a name="40301-22_para9"></a>There are two directives on environmental assessment. The first is the strategic environmental assessment directive&#151;2001/42/EC. The second is the environmental impact assessment directive&#151;85/337/EC&#151;which was amended in 1997. The environmental impact assessment directive requires an EIA of "development consents" which entitle a developer to proceed with a project. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said of statements of development principles and that directive:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An environmental impact assessment will not be required on an application for a statement of development principles, because such a statement is not a development consent".&#151;[Official Report, 29/1/04; col. 354.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-22_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40301-22_para11"></a>We agree that a statement of development principles is not a development consent, so the EIA directive would not apply on that basis. However, the Minister's comment did not address whether the strategic environmental assessment directive would apply.
<P>

<a name="40301-22_para12"></a>The Government need to answer on the issue. If strategic environment assessment applies, the SoDP process will be much slower and far more expensive and complicated than appears in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40301-22_para13"></a>There will need to be a screening process to decide whether a particular request for an SoDP needs an environment assessment. If it does, an environmental report has to be prepared, consulted upon and made available to the public.
<P>

<a name="40301-22_para14"></a>An environmental report will include: an outline of the contents of the plan; relevant aspects of the current state of the environment; details of the environmental <P>


<a name="column_515"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 515</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>characteristics of areas likely to be significantly affected; existing environmental problems; environmental protection objectives; likely significant effects on biodiversity, population, human health, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, cultural heritage, architecture, archaeology, landscape and the inter-relationship between those factors. Mitigation measures and alternatives will have to be considered.
<P>

<a name="40301-22_para15"></a>Finally, there would be a non-technical summary. Trans-boundary implications would have to be addressed. A reasoned decision has to be given and published. The requirements of the directive are onerous but they do not replace any requirement for environmental impact assessment when a planning application is made.
<P>

<a name="40301-22_para16"></a>There is some sense in applying the directive&#151;how can a local authority decide on the principle of a development without knowing what the environmental effects will be? However, it will make SoDPs harder to obtain. Some of the reasoning for SoDPs has been to avoid problems which have arisen in environmental impact assessments of outline planning applications. The Government may find themselves requiring two environmental assessments rather than one. The legal advice which we have been given from those with expertise in environmental impact assessment is that the strategic environmental assessment directive will apply to SoDPs. The amendment requires strategic environmental assessments of those projects falling within Article 3 of the directive. Ultimately the answer is more important than the wording of the amendment, as the directive has to be complied with in any event.
<P>

<a name="40301-22_para17"></a>We have to get this right, as it is complicated. First, any SoDP regime must be lawful. Secondly, a need for environmental assessment is a powerful argument that SoDPs will not be used because of the time, cost and practical difficulties involved. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I can give a fairly short and succinct answer to assist the debate. Amendment No. 128 would require the local planning authority to carry out an environmental assessment of any proposed development consisting of projects listed in Annexes 1 and 2 of directive 85/337/EC, which could have significant effects on the environment prior to issuing a statement of development principles. The amendment does not work, because it refers to an environmental assessment under directive 2001/42/EC, which is the directive that requires environmental assessment of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"plans and programmes which set the framework for future development consent of projects".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-22_para18"></a>
It does not apply to development consents for projects, which is covered by the environmental assessment directive and does not apply to statements of development principles, because they are not development consents. We would see no reason in any event to introduce new and unnecessary requirements. All the costs of carrying out such an assessment shall be placed on the local planning authority. Moreover, the environmental impact assessment directive places <P>


<a name="column_516"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 516</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the responsibility for providing information for the environmental impact assessment with the developer. I hope that those points clarify the situation, in case the noble Lord wishes to come back at a later stage.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-22_para21"></a><P>

<a name="40301-22_para22"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall not detain the House too long in moving the amendment. The amendment will enable a development order to provide that a parish council that wishes to be notified of a request for an SoDP made in its area will be able to notify the relevant local planning authority that it should be notified of such requests. We have stated that the publicity and consultation procedures for this should mirror those for planning applications.
<P>

<a name="40301-22_para23"></a>The amendment will ensure that the provisions concerning the involvement of a parish council will achieve that. Parish councils can currently notify the relevant planning authority that they wish to be notified of planning applications in their area. The amendment would ensure that parishes would be made aware of proposed developments, if they want to be, and it will provide them with the opportunity to comment at an early stage. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-23_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock </B>   moved Amendment No. 130A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 42, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-23_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "DEVELOPMENT ORDERS: EXTERNAL LIGHTING
<br>
(1) Within two years of the commencement of section 40, the appropriate authority shall make regulations for restricting or regulating the use of external lighting so far as appears to the authority to be expedient in the interests of amenity or public safety.
<br>
(2) The appropriate authority is&#151;
<br>
(a) the Secretary of State in relation to England;
<br>
(b) the National Assembly for Wales in relation to Wales."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-23_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 130A. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that lighting is brought under planning control through provisions in the Bill for enabling regulations. At an earlier stage we discussed the problems of light pollution and its damaging effect on the environment. We discussed the problems of viewing the stars in the night sky, and some of us recognised that rural areas that suffer from light <P>


<a name="column_517"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 517</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pollution feel much more like towns. Badly angled light beams can cause light trespass, and this not only causes problems for residents next door to such lights, but it can be harmful to wildlife. Some people would say that we waste rather a lot of energy on unnecessary lighting as well.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para2"></a>The situation at present is that artificial light is not classed as development. Regardless of the intrusiveness of the light beams, if the fixture does not significantly alter the appearance of a building, if it is not a free standing structure, the light cannot be classed as development and is not subject to planning controls. Similarly, light is not specifically listed as a statutory nuisance. While it is possible to use statutory nuisance provisions to control light pollution, there is a lot of confusion about whether and how light pollution can be classed as a statutory nuisance. As a result, many local authorities and environmental health officers are reluctant to take action.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para3"></a>The problem of light pollution was recognised by the Science and Technology Committee in another place. The report, Light Pollution and Astronomy, was produced by the Committee in 2003. It made some recommendations for action to Government. The main recommendations were that making obtrusive light a statutory nuisance would mean that local council environmental health officers could take legal action against serious "bad neighbour" light polluters.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para4"></a>Another recommendation was new and effective planning guidance on light pollution for local planners, in order for them to draw up local planning policies to tackle light pollution and to refuse planning permission for new developments with bad lighting schemes. Better government guidance for local councils in their role as highways authorities was also suggested, so that they install better-directed, more efficient street and road lighting as they deal with the massive backlog of old and dilapidated equipment. We have made better progress on street lighting than we have on other aspects.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para5"></a>The Government took few immediate measures following the committee's report. However, they have stated they believe that local authorities should include policies on external lighting in their development plans. The Government also have a commitment to issuing planning policy to local planning authorities on light pollution and writing model planning conditions to minimise the adverse effect of outdoor lighting. The Government have also considered making serious light pollution a statutory nuisance, and many people who are concerned about it would welcome the action. However, nothing is happening quickly.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para6"></a>An amendment was tabled to the Bill in another place, and the Government were not up front about it. The Minister, Yvette Cooper, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any legislation would have to be practically enforceable. That would require the ability to make assessments that are sufficiently robust and clear to survive arguments in the courts where the cases may end up".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee A, 21/10/03; col. 255.]

<a name="column_518"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 518</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
That is precisely what people will be asking for, and I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para8"></a>When we discussed the matter at the previous stage, the Minister expressed sympathy but he was not particularly forthcoming. Many people believe&#151;I am grateful to the CPRE for much of the briefing&#151;that there is scope to use the planning system to control light pollution more effectively and to make it more certain. Many of the issues I have raised today are ones with which people have tried to grapple, and this is another where they come up against legislation giving them insufficient support.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para9"></a>The amendment proposes introducing statutory enabling provisions and uses the model of the advertisement clause in the principal Act&#151;the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. I hope that the Minister will look on it favourably, or at least come forward with something else. The advantages of my proposals are that they would provide a self-contained code through regulations for the control of lighting and they would not depend on the lighting requiring planning permission or constituting a nuisance. The nature of lighting requiring specific consent would be defined in the regulations, and enforcement will therefore be much easier. If consent were granted, it could be made subject to conditions.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para10"></a>There is a precedent for this approach; the amendment is based on the regime applicable to outdoor advertisements. I hope that the Minister will be a little more forthcoming than he was when we last discussed the issue. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   My Lords, I introduced a similar amendment in Committee and I was encouraged by the wide variety of Members who chose to speak to it and to support it. It was encouraging to hear the Minister say in reply that he believed it would be possible to introduce an annex to PPS23, which would give local authorities some power of control. I hope that today the Government Front Bench will be able to give us further information about their plans.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is quite right that the matter was raised in Committee, but I think that I was most forthcoming on the issue recently in response to a Question on the issue of light pollution four or five weeks ago. I remember waving in the House the department's already existing publication on guidance, no details or references to which I have here tonight. In seven minutes at Question Time, with the Questions and Answers, I managed to get quite a lot of good information on to the record, because one is much more disciplined at Question Time.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para11"></a>When a similar amendment was proposed in Committee, we had a great deal of sympathy with the intention of the amendment&#151;which remains the case. We said that we agreed that excessive, poorly designed, badly aimed lighting can have significant adverse effects on people, wildlife, the amenity and those who look at the sky. But we should remember that good, well designed lighting is an effective way to reduce road accidents, reduce crime and the fear of crime, and enhance community safety; it has a very important role <P>


<a name="column_519"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 519</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to play in creating good conditions. We must strike a balance between the benefits of lighting and the potential adverse impacts.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para12"></a>New legislation could have significant implications both for those who wish to put up exterior lighting and for local planning authorities who would have to deal with the additional applications. It would be difficult to design a feasible means of assessing external light for statutory planning control purposes. The legislation must be enforceable and practical&#151;that would be a key part of the problem. If we are to have an enforcement regime, somebody has to be able to measure and make an assessment that will stand up in court.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para13"></a>Bad lighting practice&#151;and there is a lot of it about&#151;is best dealt with by raising public awareness, providing policy advice and guidance, and by more effective use of the existing planning powers, such as the development plan policies on external lighting and the use of planning conditions to mitigate the adverse effects of external lighting.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para14"></a>As was said, the Science and Technology Select Committee in the other place considered the issue and produced its report on light pollution and astronomy on 6 October last year. It did not recommend the introduction of new planning legislation. It recommended that obtrusive light be made a statutory nuisance. I understand that at present Defra is considering that recommendation as an option; it is that government department's responsibility.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para15"></a>The committee also recommended the introduction of new planning policy guidance on light pollution, and we have said that we will act on that recommendation. We will introduce&#151;as I said in Committee and at Question Time&#151;an annexe to Planning Policy Statement 23, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, which deals with planning and pollution control. We will produce an annexe specifically on light pollution. We will send clear signals to local planning authorities that they should take the issue of light pollution as seriously as they do other types of pollution when considering planning applications. The annexe will have the same status as the parent planning policy statement and will be a material consideration in the preparation of regional spatial strategies and local development documents, and in the consideration of planning applications. So there would be no get-out; it would be a material consideration in terms of whatever was proposed.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para16"></a>Given the potentially significant implications that new legislation would have on local planning authorities, which will have to deal with the additional applications and proposed new policy guidance, we hope that the matter will not be pursued.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para17"></a>As I remember waving around that day, we have already produced guidance&#151;for example, on lighting in the countryside&#151;towards good practice, which provides practical advice to local authorities, developers and the public on what can be done to lessen the adverse effects of external lighting. This <P>


<a name="column_520"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 520</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>guidance is freely available and is on the ODPM website, whose address I think I gave out twice at Question Time.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para18"></a>We are positive about this issue, which has been looked at by an all-party committee in Parliament and by those outside&#151;I remember seeing the maps that were produced, and, I think, photographs or maps of light pollution produced by CPRE in its very useful document circulated in the autumn of last year to coincide with the Select Committee hearings.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para19"></a>We are positive about it, and, boringly repetitive though it may be to say it, we do not think that it is right for the Bill. We will act to bring in the bad practice of light pollution&#151;covering regional spatial strategies, development plans and particular planning applications&#151;in such a way that it will have to be taken account of, as it will be a material consideration. I regret to say that I do not have a date for that. I hope that I will have something more to report at Third Reading, although I also hope that we will not raise every issue again then, because we will not get the job done.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para20"></a>As for the timing for the proposed annex to Policy Planning Statement 23, there is no date in my notes. We will work with stakeholders to consider what might be included in the annex, which will then be subject to wider consultation. Planning Policy Statement 23 is due to be published this spring, and the annex will follow it, once the work with stakeholders and the consultation are complete. That sounds like the summer before the autumn of this year to me.

<A NAME="40301-23_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that full reply. I agree with him that it is about striking the right balance as regards the need to make sure that places are sufficiently lit to protect people from crime and make areas safe. However, there have been problems.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para21"></a>I thought that the amendment, which was recommended to me by the Campaign to Protect Rural England, was rather imaginative and dealt with the question of advertisements. I thought that it was a good way of doing that, and I did not see that it would be particularly onerous. It would make things clear. However, I welcome the fact that the Government are giving the matter serious consideration and will bring out an annex.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para22"></a>One gets worried about yet another consultation. Later on in this stage, I may have criticisms to make on some of the consultations. I hope that it will not take too long and that the Government will listen.
<P>

<a name="40301-23_para23"></a>People are concerned that there should be something in place that enables local authorities to give the matter the priority that it needs and take the action that they want to take. I shall read carefully what the Minister said, but, in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-24_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40301-24_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 130B is grouped with Amendments Nos. 131 and 134, to which my noble friend Lady Maddock has attached her name. They are to be introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, or, perhaps, by my noble friend&#151;there is some negotiation going on behind me. They are perhaps the more important amendments in the group. My amendment is a small one.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para2"></a>We have already talked today about the problems with statements of development principle and the Government's concern to see that outline applications contain more detail than is currently required. I said that I supported that, and I made a note to table Amendment No. 130B some time ago, in order to show that we did not oppose everything that the Government were doing. It was intended to be helpful, and I had not appreciated that we would probably cover the point in an earlier debate. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 131 and 134. We have had the debate about the importance of design, and I shall not repeat the arguments. The amendments would ensure that design elements were an important part of consideration for outline planning permission. Local authorities would have the power to demand that people considered the design principles.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para3"></a>There is not a lot more to say, as we have had the debate. I hope that, when the Minister tables the promised amendments about the importance of design in the planning process, as set out in the Bill, he will ensure that they deal with all the stages. We have rehearsed the arguments about how important it is, but the earlier people start considering the design of buildings, the better chance we will have of ensuring that the final product is satisfactory. It sends a very powerful message that this is not something tacked on at the end, when the local authority complains about the standard of design in a planning application, but that it starts at the very first stage. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that he will have that in mind when he brings forward his proposals at Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said, we have had this debate. We have also heard some very helpful noises from the Minister and I understand that this is something we shall get at Third Reading. It is always very difficult to have to wait until Third Reading because one never knows quite what one will get. One has to hold one's breath and hope that it will turn out right, that one will be able to accept it and that it will be what is wanted.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para4"></a>I am optimistic. These amendments are about honesty; they are about making sure that developers are up-front about what they want to do and about the impact that it will have on local communities. What <P>


<a name="column_522"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 522</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>developers say at outline stage should be carried through in the final design and any differences should be made absolutely clear so that people's attention can be drawn to them so that they can comment on them and deal with them as they wish. I am hoping for an encouraging holding reply from the Minister on these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, have said, we have debated this subject. There is not a great deal more that I can add.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para5"></a>These amendments are interesting because they get down to the detail of how in practice design might work as part of the planning process. Reflecting on my local government experience, it is how the framework is set and what is implied by having a statement of design principles submitted with outline planning applications that creates the opportunity for discussion, debate, refinement and further thought about what is to be achieved through a particular development, the benefits that might accrue to the community and how it might improve the quality of civic space. These are interesting amendments for that reason.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para6"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has said, proposals will be brought back at Third Reading that will include design on the face of the Bill. There has been a lot of consultation. My speaking note tells me that there have been some very valuable discussions on these issues with the British Property Federation, the House Builders Federation and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors which welcomed the statement that was made about design on 15 December.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para7"></a>I hope that the Government can match the aspirations that have been discussed in your Lordships' House. It is certainly our intention to move in that direction. Having heard that, I hope that the noble Lord and the noble Baroness will not move the amendments that they have tabled at this stage and will await Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-24_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that there was any response to Amendment No. 130B. Perhaps the Minister thought that I was not asking for one, but I hate to deprive him of the opportunity of getting something on the record on the part of the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for the prompt. Amendment No. 130B suggests that applications for planning permission cover both outline and full applications. Our response is that if we were to decide to retain outline planning permission&#151;and, as the noble Baroness will know, there is an internal discussion going on about that issue&#151;this amendment would, so far as we are concerned, be unnecessary. The reason for this is that the term "planning permission" covers both outline and full permission. I am sure that the noble Baroness understands that. For that reason, and because there are continuing discussions on the issue, it is not an amendment to which we are attracted. I am <P>

<a name="40301-24_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40301-24_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I do not think that we need delay the House for too long on Amendments Nos. 132 and 133.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para13"></a>When I raised the matter in Committee, it was heartening to hear the Minister defend local authority discretion. However, I am still keen to know whether it is possible, under the current language of Clause 43, for two local planning authorities that share a border to demand that entirely different particulars be included in a planning application for the same development.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para14"></a>Of course, as everyone knows, we defend local autonomy and discretion, so we will not press the amendment today. The language as it stands might be welcome to us. I seek clarification about the issue of the local planning authorities' freedom to decide what is necessary for inclusion in planning applications. How does this freedom relate to development orders that specify what applications should contain? Do the Government believe that the difference between two authorities on what must be included on applications could be a source of delay in the delivery of a cross-border project? I look forward to the Minister's response. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-24_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, one way of answering the noble Lord is this: if you genuinely believe in the local planning authority's discretion, then, if there is a cross-border project, each authority must be left to deal with its own part of the project. You cannot, on the one hand, give them maximum discretion to do it in their own way, and, on the other, seek to constrain them because there happens to be a cross-border project. I do not know of many examples.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-24_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister going to condone a road that is three-lane, two-lane, one-lane, three-lane, two-lane, one-lane as it goes through various authorities?

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-24_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, life is not like that. Planning authorities are not stupid. It is true that they may be open to criticism. I do not have many examples&#151;though roads are obviously a good example&#151;but I can think of other projects.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para15"></a>For example, there is a former industrial site in one of the growth areas in Northamptonshire which is now another kind of enterprise altogether. It is in one of my photographs in the exhibition that opened today at Westminster Hall. I did not know that the boundary of two local authorities went through the site. When the steelworks was demolished and proposals were produced for the motor speedway at Rockingham, one authority had one policy on helicopter landings and the other one had a different policy. But they came to an agreement, and the development went ahead. They were sensible about it and did it their way. I asked how the local authority boundary had ended up going through the middle of a steelworks, but I understand that that was an accident of history. I cannot be more precise than that.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para16"></a>However, we genuinely believe that local authorities must be allowed to exercise their judgment in deciding what information additional to that provided by the prescribed standard application they need in order to make the assessment. I realise that the amendments are probing, but their effect would be to remove the local authority's discretion.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para17"></a>The noble Lord has not given me any examples of cross-border developments other than that of roads in which there has not been a satisfactory outcome to a problem. So that is best left to the local authority. It is true that introducing a standard planning application form to be used by all local authorities in England is a change, but it provides the essential information that local authorities will need to determine the application.
<P>

<a name="40301-24_para18"></a>As an example, let us consider what happens if a developer makes an application to neighbouring authorities for developments that are essentially the same. It could do so by providing the same level of information on the same form. It is true that each authority, because their areas will be different, may come back to ask for a little bit of extra, different information relevant to its site. It is up to them if they want to do that. If they want information specific to the area, they must have discretion to demand it. However, in the absence of any examples of where satisfactory outcomes have not been achieved, I rest my case.

<A NAME="40301-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas </B>   moved Amendment No. 135:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 43, insert the following new clause&#151; 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-25_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "Designs and masterplans
<br>
 In the principal Act after section 54A (status of development plans) there is inserted the following new section&#151;
<br>
"54B MERIT OF APPLICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
<br>
In determining any application for planning permission for development, special regard is to be had to the merit of any design, masterplan or permitted drawings which have been submitted in connection with any existing permission for development on the application site.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-25_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment picks up a point that was discussed briefly in Committee but was not the subject of a separate amendment. I have attempted to devise an amendment to deal with the matter. The principal problem arises where a planning application is submitted and agreed with a fine design from, for example, the Richard Rogers Partnership but, when it comes to be built, it is the subject of a second planning permission with no architect at all&#151;just something put together by the builders. The whole project may have been greatly degraded, but the planning authority feels that, as it has granted permission for a development consisting of that number of houses and, apart from their design, the houses will be pretty much the same, it has no leg to stand on in arguing with the change of design.
<P>

<a name="40301-25_para2"></a>I hope that that will be ironed out under the proposals that we are to consider on Third Reading. It is not an everyday abuse, but it is sufficiently common to have been given the name within the profession of "trophy architecture". So it is an abuse that has clearly gained some currency. I hope that, when we read the Government's proposals, that will be dealt with along with the other difficulties that face authorities that want to ensure good design in their areas. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-25_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, my name is attached to this amendment. It highlights an issue that my noble friend Lord Greaves mentioned in Committee. He gave us a graphic description of what had happened in a town in Lancashire where the local authority had gone to a lot of trouble to achieve a really good design. For whatever reason, that then fell out of the equation and the application was taken up by someone else and something entirely unsatisfactory&#151;nothing like the original proposal&#151;was built. So the issue is important.
<P>

<a name="40301-25_para3"></a>When the Minister presents his proposals on Third Reading for writing design principles into the Bill, I hope that they will cover all the different stages. The Government have been positive in what they have said, but I did not receive a clear answer in response to my previous amendment when I asked whether they will address that at every stage. The stage that we are discussing is especially important, as the example cited by my noble friend Lord Greaves demonstrated and as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, just said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I have been thinking about this issue recently as we faced problems in my borough. Let us suppose that designs are put forward <P>


<a name="column_526"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 526</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for planning permission by one developer and that that developer has an architect; however, the developer decides not to proceed with the same planning application, and another developer decides to take it on. The question is whether those plans and designs are transferable to the new developer, and whether the new developer is bound by the design of an architect whom he might otherwise not have employed.
<P>

<a name="40301-25_para4"></a>My view is that one ought to do exactly what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said, which is, "That's the plan; that's the design; you build it". But when it passes to another developer, I am not sure what powers there are to enforce that. We might be able to put that into the Bill. But I am still not certain that we could force a developer to take up the plans of another architect to develop the scheme.
<P>

<a name="40301-25_para5"></a>I am not disagreeing with that; I think that it is very meritorious and extremely sensible. I am merely looking at the practical implications of how one can do it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-25_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether it would be possible to condition the original application, but even if it were, would it be proper to do so? I think that the noble Baroness alluded to that. Perhaps the discussion takes us back to the need for good design and a requirement for good design principles to be followed, which should be written in at the earliest possible stage. If that were written in at the start, there would be something objective so that if a switch took place, there would be a principle to be complied with. That would help local authorities which may not have pinned down the details of the first application to which they can stick if someone comes along with a substitute.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord Lucas on this hugely important point. It is one of the tragedies of this country that for several decades of the latter part of the previous century some appalling developments and building took place. One of the aspects on which I want to focus&#151;although I am not sure whether my noble friend's amendment covers it&#151;is the importance of the material to be used, which is as important as the actual design. It will be unfortunate if a splendid scheme that has been submitted by a distinguished and caring architect for a patron who wishes to put up something of real quality falls and lapses, and a subsequent developer does not have anything like the same motivation, but tries to piggy-back on that earlier application to a much lower standard of design and materials. I hope that the Bill will ensure that increasing attention will be paid to design and materials for both private and public buildings&#151;non-residential office buildings, and so on.
<P>

<a name="40301-25_para6"></a>We have discussed the issue already, but the amendment brings it out. Again, one cannot resist referring to the United States, where I travel every year, particularly the downtown areas of American cities. In general, the quality of office buildings especially is streets ahead of what we have in this country, although not in every case. My noble friend is on to something really important. The Bill should be <P>


<a name="column_527"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 527</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>used to ensure that we do not have the kind of shoddy buildings that were put up in the latter part of the previous century.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, raised a very valid point. From looking at major developments in my home city, it seems that we often accept designs that we would not consider in a better world. But because of the framework within which planning considerations take place, it is difficult to establish benchmarks and principles, and so forth.
<P>

<a name="40301-25_para7"></a>Time and again, the issue that arose was that there was a very useful, good, virgin site within the confines of the city centre. Because of the financial atmosphere in which the development was proposed a mega-plan would be put forward, which the developer would find it was unable to carry through; for example, money did not stack up and things could not be made to happen. The proposed development would lapse. Some years later another grand set of proposals would come forward, which may or may not proceed because of the financial package that was in place. At the same time, in the back of one's mind, one still had the excellence or merits of an earlier application; that is, what it had been trying to achieve and the nature of the buildings that were on offer.
<P>

<a name="40301-25_para8"></a>This amendment is interesting. It takes us back to the detail of the whole design issue. But I do not think that this is the way to deal with it. The wording suggests that we should have,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"special regard ... to the merit of any design".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-25_para9"></a>
That is fine, but I am not quite sure what it means as regards this legislation. Obviously, it is an important issue, but it would be better placed in the background guidance, information, framework and criteria used to tease out design issues. Although the amendment reconfigures part of our earlier important debate, I am not sure that it takes us any closer to what noble Lords seek today.
<P>

<a name="40301-25_para10"></a>The department looking at these issues is thinking about perhaps the full endorsement of the CABE guidance that protects design quality in the planning system as a companion guide to PPS1; or perhaps to revise some of the existing good practice guidance in PPG1 to ensure that it continues to promote best practice; and to provide further advice on the methods and tools available to ensure good quality design; for example, model conditions.
<P>

<a name="40301-25_para11"></a>I want to reassure noble Lords that we are taking these issues very seriously. The Government want to tackle the important issues of urban design. We are thinking somewhat imaginatively in careful consultation with those who know how we can best achieve that. I applaud the efforts made by noble Lords. As the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, said, planning Bills do not come along too often. This is an opportunity to get to grips with these important design issues. We all want to lever up design standards and provide the right kind of framework within which imaginative design can flourish and be encouraged.

<a name="40301-25_para12"></a>I do not know whether that takes us much further forward with Amendment No. 135, which is in any sense slightly flawed and not quite in the right place and of the right design.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, does he recognise that the problem we are trying to address is that if a good quality design is approved at one stage of the process it is not possible for it to go backwards at another stage? That is what we have identified as part of the problem. I was not sure from his remarks whether he recognised how we would deal with it.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, again before the Minister sits down&#151;this is part of the same issue&#151;does he accept that if a good application is approved and then later another applicant comes along with something similar that is not good quality, the local planning authority needs to have the tools to say no without fear of being taken to appeal on the basis that the first one, which is close, has been approved? That is a practical danger.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I see that. Perhaps my comments did not reflect enough on the issue. I recognise that it is a problem. We have all been in and understand local government. We have all come across such examples: how do we tackle them? Obviously there have to be clear design policies within the local planning framework, which will be distilled from the national framework, and there has to be an effective use of planning conditions. Those are the building blocks of the issue.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para0"></a>I want to consider the matter further. We may need to provide a note identifying how we see it working in practice, because I recognise the issue. Sometimes councillors on planning committees would like to say, "We'd like to have the design we had last time round: can we have it now with this developer?" However, the real world does not work like that. As we know, the financial framework that surrounds development moves on all the time. There are new ways of generating revenue out of development and communities want new things; and there are new objectives for any given site, particularly if it is well placed and can be used for different purposes&#151;leisure, retail, housing and so on&#151;depending on the money available for it. We have to recognise that there are some constraints but not lose sight of the overall push to improve the quality of design with a particular development proposal or set of proposals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, put it well in her interjection. The core of the issue is to ensure that a local planning authority faced with a second application for a site where it has already granted permission feels able to say, "No: the reason we gave that application permission is that the design <P>


<a name="column_529"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 529</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was good. Yours may have the same number of houses with the same number of rooms and a similar layout, but the design is not good for other reasons and that is why we are rejecting it," and to be confident that that is a valid reason. Such a provision would enable authorities to look back to an earlier application by another developer and say, "No, you can't read over from one to the other because you haven't got the design right". I can see that the Front Bench opposite understands and I am delighted.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para1"></a>Nothing in what we are trying to do will give us universal good design. The best architects can design buildings that we find horrible or difficult to get on with. I shudder every time I cross Vauxhall bridge going south: other people think that it is wonderful.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para2"></a>We cannot achieve perfection by laying down rules. I hope, however, that we achieve a system where someone could build another building as wonderful and eccentric as the Royal Pavilion in Brighton. It must have seemed difficult at the time. Indeed, I am even starting to like the British Library; there are some nice things about it now that one is familiar with it. Thoughts and tastes move on and early judgments can be wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may interject with a point that might amuse the noble Lord. In the 1920s there was a move on the part of the then Brighton town council to have the Royal Pavilion demolished. They probably thought it was vulgar, but that was the taste at the time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am glad they missed that one. This is not about perfection, but ensuring that the worst is dealt with, that the real horrors are prevented. One is just being put up opposite where I am. It is so obviously bad and I am sure that everyone knows exactly what I am talking about. I look forward to Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-26_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 136 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 137 and 149. I am not sure about giving the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, ideas about becoming a Prince Regent but, if he builds another Royal Pavilion, I hope that it will have jolly good access arrangements, because that is the concern of these amendments.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para6"></a>The first amendment in the group concerns access statements to accompany planning applications. We all agree that disabled access is currently addressed much too late in the process. At present, the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 simply requires that a developer's attention is drawn to the issue on his being granted planning permission and later at the stage of building control. We have the new good practice guidance from the ODPM encouraging authorities on their part to encourage applicants to submit access statements with their applications. The guidance argues that such statements are key to getting developers to take seriously the issue of inclusive design at the earliest stages. It suggests that if an access statement is not submitted, the local planning authority could reject the registration of the application, with the comment that this would overcome the matter delaying the eight-week period which applies.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para7"></a>Four years ago, the Disability Rights Task Force recommended revisiting, reviewing and revising Section 76 of the 1990 Act when a suitable legislative <P>


<a name="column_531"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 531</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opportunity arose. I recall saying at the previous stage that if this is not the opportunity, what is. Further, as has been mentioned more than once in this Chamber, action was pledged in the Government's 2001 manifesto.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para8"></a>This provision would require the developer to outline the process undertaken to establish the access provisions within the design and would also apply where a building was undergoing a change of use. The exact form of the statement would depend on the size, nature and complexity of the scheme. It could also specify how the building should be managed and operated to ensure that it continues to be exclusive&#151;I am sorry, I meant to say "inclusive"; I hope that that was not a Freudian slip. Specifying information early would be in the interests of the developer so as to avoid later delays and costs.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para9"></a>The Government have said that they will consult on whether access statements should be a required document and have used the term in this connection in appropriate circumstances. At the previous stage, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, queried whether such a provision should apply generally. I suggested to the Disability Rights Commission&#151;which has provided me with considerable assistance, not least by giving me the appropriate nudge to table these amendments again&#151;that wording such as,

<br>

I hope that tonight he can be much clearer about the timetable and give us a statement that applications without an access statement will not be entertained. It would be useful to know more about Government thinking as to what applications they would wish to exempt. Perhaps he can also help the House as to the application of access statements in the case of listed buildings and scheduled monuments when the impact on access to and around the building and monument is in issue.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para13"></a>Amendment No. 137 seeks to place a new duty on authorities to have due regard to the need to ensure that reasonable provision is made so that buildings and their approaches are accessible to and usable by people regardless of disability, age or gender. The amendment is intended to ensure that all planning officers, committees and inspectors properly scrutinise planning applications against relevant access standards and provisions so that potential design barriers can be nipped in the bud. Again it is a matter of getting to the issue early.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para14"></a>We think that it would make it more likely that applications that had not properly addressed access would be rejected or would have specific conditions attached to them. This would, we think, provide for greater consistency across different planning authorities&#151;I am told that they are something of a <P>


<a name="column_532"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 532</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>patchwork at the moment. It is intended also to ensure that a better balance is found between access, ability and conservation principles.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para15"></a>We are aware of the issue around listed building consent. Preserving the character of a listed building may appear to conflict with proposals to widen a door or make other access improvements. Under current legislation disability access is a much lesser consideration than preserving the building character, even though with a little imagination and hard work in many cases a solution could take both into account. The Minister said in Committee that an amendment similar to this was not necessary. I think it is.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para16"></a>Finally, there is the repeal of Section 76. As I have said, its repeal was a manifesto commitment. That is important but the underlying issue is more important, which is it that the provision is out-of-date and does not reflect the Government's current policy. The Government have said that they are not revising the section because they want to mainstream disability access through new planning policy statements. The Disability Rights Task Force did not recommend either revision of Section 76 or updating guidance. The Government should do both. I do not know whether it is up to the Opposition to make too much of a point about how the Government deal with the issue; nor do I know how such a decision in respect of a manifesto commitment would be regarded outside, but we can probably read between the lines well enough.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para17"></a>Revised guidance is not adequate. It will not end the huge variances in the ways in which different local planning authorities address the issue of access to the built environment. The courts do not always leave planning guidance where it starts. We shall no doubt spend time later on Section 106&#151;although perhaps not later tonight&#151;but the guidance there states that local authorities should not seek a contribution unless it is necessary and directly related to the proposed development, and case law broadened the interpretation of the kind of contribution that could be required. That is an example of guidance not staying quite where it started.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para18"></a>Generally, of course, the courts attach more importance to statutory duties than to guidance, and unless and until there are clear duties in planning law on inclusive environments, too many planning officers and too many inspectors will continue to assume that access is a matter to be left to the building control process; that it is an add-on about which they do not need to bother their heads too much at the stage at which they are involved.
<P>

<a name="40301-26_para19"></a>These are very important issues. I know that the House's heart is in the right place but, as with so much in this area, we must find a mechanism to achieve what we all want. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40301-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins: </B>   My Lords, I strongly support the three amendments. They are essential for ensuring that access is brought into the beginning of the planning process. I hope that the Minister will give a favourable response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, if we manage to get the planning process to take forward the issue of access, we shall probably save everyone a great deal of time and money. Probably the only people whom it will affect, I am afraid, are the lawyers, because they will have to ensure that the legislation complies with the new regulations coming in at present. The draft Bill is being discussed. Can the Minister give an assurance that if the Government stay where they are they will not be contradicting the spirit of the Disability Discrimination Act? If they cannot give that assurance, they should look long and hard at this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, this is a classic example of where a Minister should put his oar into the debate straightaway. I do not wish to prolong the discussion. The case has been made that the access statement should be on the face of the Bill. I shall take these amendments away and come back at Third Reading with something that addresses these concerns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for that answer and for his obvious preparedness for Third Reading&#151;I know that the Government Chief Whip is listening to this&#151;which will be quite a long occasion and certainly a very interesting one.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para0"></a>Although the Minister said that what is proposed is instantly acceptable, that does not always stop people talking. His reply is obviously welcome, but I hope that he will forgive me for making the point again&#151;it may seem a little trite and obvious&#151;that it is important that the Government's amendments are published in time, not only for those of us who will speak to them, but for stakeholders to be consulted. I have no doubt that the Government are working with them in any event and will continue to do so. Those who have proposed amendments such as those to which I have spoken should be in no doubt that the Government's proposals meet all the points that have been raised. The issues before us have been around for a good while. They are not wholly straightforward. It is important that stakeholders are satisfied with the outcome. I am not trying to teach my grandmother to suck eggs on that point. It is merely an issue that should be addressed before Third Reading. In thanking the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield </B>   moved Amendment No. 138:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 31, line 14, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-27_para4"></a><P>

"( ) Any planning application that the Secretary of State declares is of national or regional importance, as designated through subsection (1) must be subject to an economic impact report.
<br>
( ) Any planning application for a major infrastructure project based on a site-specific proposal in a national policy statement White Paper shall be considered by an inspector who shall be able to question the need for a specific development."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-27_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now come to an extremely important amendment to the Government's proposals for major infrastructure projects. As I stated in Committee, I am particularly engaged with these issues as the leader of an authority that was severely affected by the Government's proposals for the expansion of airport capacity in the south-east.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para6"></a>The amendment would ensure that major infrastructure projects are subject to an economic impact report. It excludes site-specific proposals in White Paper national policy statements to prevent them reducing the scope of a public inquiry.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para7"></a>The two provisions in Amendment No. 138 are crucial to enhancing the Government's proposals for major infrastructure projects. I shall speak to each in turn.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para8"></a>The first part of the amendment would require the Secretary of State to conduct an economic impact report on any planning matter that he deems to fall within this part of the Bill. Major infrastructure projects, which may cause great damage to the environment, are usually promoted on the basis that they will deliver economic regeneration benefits. Therefore, a robust appraisal of whether demonstrable economic benefits will accrue must take place.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para9"></a>The examples of the Hastings bypasses and the West Midlands strategic western bypasses, which have been brought to my attention by the CPRE, show that an economic impact report would have greatly helped the decision-making process in each case. In each case, there was a lack of clarity about the assumptions which underlay the bypasses and the proper justification for them. Economic impact reports would avoid those problems by comprehensively probing new infrastructure proposals for their genuine economic implications, both positive and negative. They would provide a firm, realistic and impartial basis for discussion of a project's likely economic consequences.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para10"></a>Noble Lords may be interested to know that the Government have already accepted the logic of my argument. The Department for Transport is taking forward the recommendation of its standing advisory committee on trunk road assessments that economic impact reports be produced before decisions on new transport infrastructure are taken forward.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para11"></a>Since that is the case, why would the Government change the rules only for transport infrastructure and only via guidance? The importance of major infrastructure projects to local communities merits including economic impact reports in the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_535"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 535</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para12"></a>We support economic impact reports also because the arguments about the economic impact should be in the public domain at an early stage. It was stated in another place that a statutory economic impact report would be unnecessary, because the economic effects of development would be examined by the inspector. That is in no way acceptable.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para13"></a>Local people who are affected by major planning proposals will not wait until an inquiry to make their voices heard. They will want to confront the issues head-on. By the time the inquiry takes place, positions will have hardened and there will be little chance of persuading people of the merits of a particular development. That would be fine if one were not too concerned about local community support, but it is wrong. We should make every effort to ensure that local people fully understand the rationale behind planning proposals of that kind.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para14"></a>Those who are in favour of development would welcome robust arguments being put into the public domain. I would have thought that the Government would seek to reshape local debate in that way.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para15"></a>The second part of the amendment is equally important. It will enable an inspector to examine the justification of a site-specific proposal in the Government's White Paper. Planning by White Paper is simply unacceptable. Of course we support the use of White Papers to provide a framework for guiding the planner of major infrastructures. However, bypassing the checks and balances in the planning system by making site-specific recommendations is another matter entirely. That is what has happened with Stansted, and Labour Peers will be aware of the legal objections being pursued by various local authorities, including my own.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para16"></a>Major infrastructure projects rarely enjoy all-round support, but they must have public legitimacy. It is an erosion of democratic decision-making if a White Paper pre-empts the question of whether a specific development is needed. A White Paper consultation certainly does not adhere to the same checks and balances as a planning application.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para17"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that during an inquiry the inspector will consider all aspects of the application, including the need for a specific development. However, a little later in the same speech, he said that the inspector should not have to spend inquiry time considering whether the need for a development exists, but should consider instead whether the need identified is outweighed by other factors.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para18"></a>The difference between those two statements is very important. The first suggests that the principle of major infrastructure projects should be examined and either taken forward or rejected. The second suggests that if a proposal is in the White Paper, the arguments about the principle or need for the development will be deemed to have taken place, but without the legitimacy of the planning process. The emphasis of any inquiry <P>


<a name="column_536"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 536</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would become one of mitigation, with only a prospect of massive environmental and social damage likely to challenge the rubber-stamping logic.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para19"></a>It is essential that the democratic safeguards in a planning system that help protect the environment and enhance the quality of life in local communities are not bypassed. We think the amendment very important. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-27_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I spoke to the amendment at the previous stage and so convinced myself that we have added our names to it. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has dealt very thoroughly with the issue, and we certainly support the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-27_para20"></a>The Minister's response in Committee&#151;I think that other amendments were dealt with at the same time; I am not sure, but we were certainly focusing on the issue&#151;was to give an interesting explanation of how major infrastructure inquiries would work. I was grateful for and interested in that, but I did not think that that explanation really answered the points made today by the noble Lord.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040301/text/40301-28.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, I so agree that the amendment is one of the most important that has been tabled to the Bill. One recognises that one of the objects of the Bill is, from the Government's point of view, where possible, to speed up planning. Where possible, I support that. However, when one comes to major projects of either national or regional importance, it is absolutely crucial that there be full consideration of all the implications of such developments. One simply cannot have a system whereby there can be a fast track for such developments.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para0"></a>I know how frustrating people find very long public inquiries, whether they be on something like a London airport or, picking one close to where I live, the old Sizewell B inquiry, which was immensely drawn out. In a sense, that was unnecessary, because the inquiry was overloaded all the time with questions about nuclear power, nuclear weapons and the CND people. It was archaic at the time that the arguments were being made, but it lasted for a long time.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para1"></a>None the less, it is important that we have a system of fundamental appraisal of need. My noble friend quoted from the Minister's slight duality of speech during the last stage, when I think my noble friend said the Minister should not take time querying the need but merely look at the consequences. However, very often, that fundamental question needs to be asked. The premise must be able to be questioned, and that will not happen through the normal planning system.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para2"></a>The amendment presupposes that the Secretary of State will decide on the instances in which the procedure proposed in the amendment would be used. That is important. In a sense, it is like the call-in procedure. There will obviously be cases where there is no dispute, but if the procedure exists it will have to be used. There will be also be marginal cases where the interest groups will argue for or against the new <P>


<a name="column_537"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 537</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>procedure. But the important matter is that the procedure should exist and should be able to question the fundamental issue.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para3"></a>I remember in my extreme youth when I was almost attracted to Marxism: it was only when one questioned its underlying fundamental assumptions that one understood its fallacies. The Minister might say that that is a far-fetched analogy, but I am trying to show that often when there is major proposal affecting the future of the country one really has to ask some fundamental questions. In the war, when we were fighting for our lives, we had to fast-track military airfields that would often be put up where they would never be set up today. That is a totally different situation. During wartime one could not have had the sort of proposal contained in the amendment, but one can now.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para4"></a>One of the appalling consequences of bypasses&#151;which, in general, I favour&#151;is that too often the territory between the bypass and the place that is to be bypassed is immediately seen as being suitable for in-filling. That might be undesirable, but is the sort of issue that should arise in the type of assessment covered by the amendment. At least, if it is decided to allow the proposal to go ahead, it should be laid down at that stage that, yes, there should be a by-pass; but that does not mean that the land will then be built upon.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para5"></a>Before the war, when such planning issues started, the ribbon development was the perfect example&#151;one built a new road and immediately started to build either side of it. Had such assessments&#151;which were launched by Sir Patrick Abercrombie and the founding fathers of protection of the countryside&#151;existed then, many of the horrors would not have happened. So although we are unlikely to resolve the matter tonight, some of us feel strongly about the matter and it is now important, insofar as we are able, to insist that something appears on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_time0"></a><H5>10 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I do not wish to belittle in any way the examples that the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, has just given. He used one example regarding the speed and urgency with which airfields were built during the war. Frankly, with the human rights industry, some proponents of which are members of this House, if we tried that today I can imagine 10,000 arguments that they would be using over why we could not do that. We are in a different situation.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para6"></a>I also note the forensic checking of my comments in Committee, which were crucial, as all three speeches have made clear. This is a fundamental part of the Bill. In fact, I have been a little surprised&#151;the timing is unfortunate&#151;that we have not had longer to spend on the matter and the amendments have been small in number. Therefore, it is important. Given our current situation, I will stick to the note that I have been provided with. It is safer for everyone all round. Thinking about what I said in Committee, there is no <P>


<a name="column_538"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 538</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contradiction in the two quotes that were used. I suspect that we will come back to the issue at Third Reading, because it is so important.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para7"></a>I conceded in Committee that the requirement for an economic impact report to be made in relation to an application that has been designated as a major infrastructure project by the Secretary of State is not necessary in the Bill. We would expect the promoter of a development of the type that we are talking about here to engage at as early a stage as possible with all parties concerned. This would mean that by the time an application for planning permission is made to the relevant local planning authority, the community will have already been actively engaged in the process. An inquiry would then be better able to focus on outstanding issues that have not been resolved at the pre-application stage. Assuming the application is called in, the inspector would consider the economic effects along with all the other aspects of the application as part of the inquiry. These would include environmental and any other impacts. Local people would have that further opportunity to raise their concerns.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para8"></a>On the second subsection of the amendment, again I reiterate what I said in Committee. Clearly, where there is a national policy statement White Paper, this will help to reduce the argument at the planning inquiry about the need for a specific development on a particular site. I did not say that it would get rid of the argument, but it would reduce the argument at a planning inquiry about the need for a specific development on a particular site. Where need is established by a national policy statement, the inspector should not have to spend inquiry time considering whether a need for the development exists, but should instead consider whether the need identified is outweighed by other factors.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para9"></a>It will be up to those who are opposed to a development to present their arguments against a specific development, and it is right that they should be free to do so and have that opportunity. This does not rule out the possibility that the inspector will spend some time looking at the need, but this will be in the context of what is said about the need in the national policy statement. I do not know whether that is the case currently, and I do not want to go down the byways&#151;but it may be that that national policy statement in the form of the White Paper has been debated and voted on in this House and the other place. It gives it even greater weight than simply a document that is not debated or approved by both Houses.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para10"></a>The inspector must ensure that all relevant impacts of the specific development are considered during an inquiry. Therefore, all material considerations will be considered in his report, together with all relevant impacts, such as the economic or environmental impacts of the project. It is a fact&#151;I am not carrying all the details with me&#151;that a considerable amount of time was spent on the Terminal 5 inquiry because there were out of date or unclear policy issues. The recent <P>


<a name="column_539"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column 539</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>aviation White Paper happens to be a useful example of our stated aim that there should be a clearer government policy statement, which may be supported by clearer regional strategies, as part of our proposals for improving the handling of major infrastructure projects.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para11"></a>The Government have set out their strategic framework for the development of airport capacity in the UK for the next 30 years. It does not authorise or preclude any particular development, but sets out a policy framework against which the relevant public bodies can plan ahead. That latter point goes a considerable way to meeting the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, that we must not have planning by White Paper. We fully accept that we must not have planning by White Paper. The procedure set out in the Bill is a lot better than planning by Parliament, which was the original plan in the planning Green Paper. That would have been an unmitigated disaster. No one has ever come back and said, "We think this is a good idea. We think Parliament should have done all this".
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para12"></a>As I have repeatedly said, it took myself, when I was planning Minister, and the Deputy Prime Minister five minutes of conversation to decide that we did not want to proceed in that way. We must still come up with a solution to how we deal with and process what would be defined as major infrastructure projects. Bearing in mind what had happened over Terminal 5, it would have been irresponsible to leave it to the status quo. That was clearly unacceptable for all concerned; the public, the developers, those who were opposed, Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all.

<A NAME="40301-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hanningfield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that answer. We are in danger of creating new policy because of one bad example; that is, Terminal 5 at Heathrow. We all accept that the Government might want to find speedier processes, but I want to reiterate that there must be a democratic process in doing so. Enormous projects have a fundamental effect not just on the area in which they are located, but in the wider region. There must be proper pre-inquiry and inquiry processes. My amendments would help the Government in taking the matter forward.
<P>

<a name="40301-28_para14"></a>At this late hour, we cannot debate the matter further but we shall certainly return to it at Third Reading. Perhaps the Minister and the Government will think again about it and will go further towards meeting our suggestions. They will help the Government but not go back to the Terminal 5 type of inquiry.

<A NAME="40301-29_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  I should like to make a brief statement about the issues initially raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, on 20 January on parliamentary privilege. The noble Baroness described her concerns about an "atmosphere of anxiety" among operators within the nuclear industry that they might face adverse consequences from a government department if they were to provide information to noble Lords opposite. The Department for Trade and Industry was mentioned in that context.
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para2"></a>This is a serious matter so let me start by setting out the position with regard to nuclear operators, specifically UKAEA and BNFL as the owners of sites that will become the responsibility of NDA on its inception. These organisations are not staffed by civil servants. They have the right to brief members of any political party either in this House or the other place. It would be improper for a government department to prevent either organisation from briefing Members of Parliament. That, of course, applies to any organisation that has been set up on an independent basis.
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para3"></a>Similarly, questions from any member of this Committee about the important matters under discussion in this Bill&#151;or in any other&#151;must be handled professionally and in accordance with the normal practices of this House.
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para4"></a>With those principles in mind, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the DTI's Permanent Secretary have considered the comments of noble Lords opposite and received reports from senior officials on the department's relationship with the nuclear operators and discussions held over the past few months more specifically about Part 1 of this Bill.

<P>

<a name="40301-29_para5"></a>We are satisfied that there is no attempt by DTI to prevent nuclear operators or other organisations from briefing the opposition, whether that briefing takes the form of answers to specific questions, general information about policy options, or detailed amendments to the Bill. We want, of course, to promote debate rather than constrain it. It is right that there should be a network of contacts at various levels to discuss the general principles governing the Bill, to consider policy options, to test the implications of amendments and, not least, to reach sensible decisions about the way in which business should be handled.
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para6"></a>With that in mind, so that there can be no misunderstanding on either side, the DTI is writing to the UKAEA and to BNFL. The letter will draw their attention to this statement and the principles which I have set out. My statement will also be drawn to the attention of those in DTI working not only on the Energy Bill but all other Bills in this Session. That will ensure that officials can be in no doubt about expectations of them when talking to stakeholders.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for initiating the investigation and for reporting back to the Committee today in the form of the statement. Obviously, we accept what the Minister has said. I do not for one moment suggest that we do not, because we do. However, it is worth noting that four people related their concerns to us. It is right that that fact should be noted; otherwise, I would not have mentioned the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I appreciate the noble Baroness's remarks and note that information. There is a further matter with which I need to deal before we turn to the amendments. At the beginning of the previous Committee Sitting, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, asked whether the Government would make a statement about the chairman of Ofgem, Sir John Mogg's, public intervention on the Government's potential amendment which is designed to give some dispensation from high transmission charges for renewable generators in peripheral areas of Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para7"></a>I feel that I should start by agreeing with the Opposition that indeed the language used and reported appeared to be strong and that when an independent regulator criticises the Government in this way, we should think carefully about what has been said. However, it is not unhealthy for an independent regulator to criticise government. Indeed, Ofgem has a long-standing reputation for independence.
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para8"></a>I shall explain the source of the disagreement. As my noble friend Lord Davies said on 12 February, Ofgem and DTI both agree that, in general, we should have a transmission charging methodology that is cost reflective, non-discriminatory and that promotes competition in generation and supply. This will encourage transmission assets to be built and charged for in the most efficient way. In turn, this will minimise the cost to the consumer. Ofgem believes that this sort of charging methodology should apply to all generators, including renewables.
<P>


<a name="column_GC151"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para9"></a>However, the Government must, of course, take its wider energy objectives into account. While Ofgem plays a part in delivering these objectives as recognised by the breadth of its statutory duties, decisions about trade-offs between environmental and economic objectives are ultimately for government and for Parliament, as we said previously during the Committee. As part of the consultation on transmission charging issued in August, the Government raised the question of whether special dispensation was needed for those renewable generators in peripheral areas that have high renewable potential and that would otherwise be impacted by the highest transmission charges in order to ensure that the Government's renewable targets can be met.
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para10"></a>I should mention that Ofgem made it clear at the time that it objected to the Government's consultation on this issue. After some consideration of the concerns raised by the renewables communities and, indeed, echoed in this Committee stage, we agreed to consider Amendment No. 113ZL, which sought to protect renewables from the high transmission charges. We also specified that the amendment that we are likely to table on Report would aim to take a power to give renewables in a specified area some dispensation to protect them from the impact of high transmission charges.
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para11"></a>In conclusion, and to make matters clear, Ofgem continues to disagree with any intervention on transmission charges, including any dispensation for renewables. The Government believe that they are entitled to consider a dispensation on transmission charges for renewables if that safeguards their wider energy objectives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank the Minister for that explanation. At this stage, as we have not seen the amendment, I am prepared to say only that it is clearly not for me to say today what our policy would or would not be. We shall obviously consider the amendment on its merits when it appears before us. I very much hope that that will be in time for us to make a considered opinion and that it will not appear merely a day before the first day of the Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   Perhaps I may add to the comments of my noble friend Lady Miller by thanking the Minister for what has been a very clear statement on this issue. I did not for one moment imagine that Sir John Mogg's statement on 14 February, or whatever the date was, was the first shot in a war that had been going on for some time. The Minister has confirmed that.
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para12"></a>Interestingly, I raised this issue at a conference held last week under the auspices of the Adam Smith Institute, where representatives of a number of interests concerned with both onshore and offshore wind power and other renewables were present. I asked for advice on whether we should believe the Secretary of State or the argument of the chairman of Ofgem. No one was particularly prepared to raise his <P>


<a name="column_GC152"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>head above the parapet. I do not want to echo the previous statement that was made but, since then, I have received two notes from those who were present but did not take part in the discussion to say that, in the last resort, it may be a matter of indifference because the customer will pay whichever way it goes and it is simply a question of the route through which the customer will pay for the transmission charges. I am not sure that that is entirely right, but we shall clearly need to debate the subject carefully when we come to the Government's amendment on Report.
<P>

<a name="40301-29_para13"></a>My only other point is that I draw a very clear distinction between that issue, which we have yet to reach and which the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, foreshadowed in his speech on 12 February, and the issue that we shall reach this afternoon, which is not about transmission but about distribution. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, stated in the Second Reading debate that that was to come. I have no difficulty with the proposals concerning distribution. We may need to consider them in detail, but I believe it is the transmission charges which are the issue. We shall debate that amendment on Report in the light of what the Minister has said to us this afternoon.

<A NAME="40301-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Kingsland </B>   moved Amendment No. 131ZA:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 111, line 19, leave out "whose interests are materially affected by it" and insert "with a sufficient interest in that decision"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-30_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40301-30_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope that after the statement by the Minister about the differences between the DTI and the regulator, the Minister will find my amendments relatively uncontroversial. I shall begin by speaking to Amendments Nos. 131ZC and 131B, before going on to Amendment No. 131C and following the rest sequentially, beginning at Amendment No. 131ZA.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para2"></a>In my submission, the Bill fails to provide an effective right of appeal against Ofgem's decisions under certain industry codes. In our view, that is a very serious deficiency. Industry codes, such as the balancing settlement code, the connection and use of system code and the gas network code, set out the fundamental trading and governance rules for competitive market operations in the gas and electricity industries. Since each gas or electricity licence will contain a condition requiring a licensee to be a party to, and comply with, the provisions in the relevant code, any contravention of the code by the licensee is equivalent to a breach of licence, against which Ofgem can take enforcement proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para3"></a>In addition, modification decisions taken under those codes by Ofgem can have a commercial impact on licensees that is at least equivalent to, and sometimes much greater than, changes to the conditions of their operating licences. It must follow that Ofgem's code modification decisions should be exposed to the possibility of challenge by a process that <P>


<a name="column_GC153"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is at least as rigorous and thorough as that operated by the Competition Commission to resolve disputed licence modifications. That process, first introduced in the Telecommunications Act 1984, is widely accepted as being both fair and final. However, the Energy Bill does not achieve an analogous process.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para4"></a>The Bill provides only a statutory codification of some of the existing principles of judicial review. We consider that something closer to a full and genuine right of appeal on the merits is justified. The recent DTI consultation paper on appeals mechanisms, entitled Strengthening the Transparency and Accountability of the Gas and Electricity Industry Code Modification Process, published in April 2003, clearly accepted that judicial review does not provide, and is not equivalent to, a right of appeal on the decisions of Ofgem. The DTI subsequently concluded, in a document entitled Government Response, published in November 2003, that the transparency and accountability of the code modification process would be improved by the creation of a right of appeal.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para5"></a>In fact, the Energy Bill fails to provide a right of appeal on the merits. Clause 146(4) gives four grounds on which an appeal against an Ofgem decision may be allowed. In my submission, it is wrong for market participants in the energy sector to be deprived of a legal right of appeal to an independent body on the merits of the key decisions taken by Ofgem, when Parliament has recognised that that is required under other legislation that addresses similar issues in other major regulated industries. The gas and electricity industries have had a legitimate expectation that any rights of appeal provided by the Energy Bill would at least be effective rights. That expectation should be met.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para6"></a>I understand that the officials in the DTI Bill team have claimed that Clauses 144 to 148, while not providing any right of appeal on the merits of a decision, create something more substantive than judicial review. However, we do not find that anywhere in the drafting of those clauses. Nor is it spelt out anywhere in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill, or in any DTI consultation paper. Very clear and specific drafting and clear Explanatory Notes would be required to create something that achieves what the DTI is reported as wanting to achieve.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para7"></a>The very use of the word "appeal" in the Bill is positively misleading. In our view, the appeal provided for under the Bill should be a genuine appeal made on the merits of the case. That could be achieved simply by following the approach taken at Section 192 of the Communications Act 2003, which provides a right of appeal from Ofcom. That Act properly relies on the language of appeal to create a jurisdiction in which the decisions of Ofcom may be reconsidered afresh by the relevant tribunal. That Act requires appellants to specify only whether they allege errors of fact or law in the original decision, or whether they are complaining about how Ofcom has exercised its discretion.
<P>


<a name="column_GC154"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para8"></a>I now turn to our two amendments on this matter. Following the language of the Communications Act, we propose the deletion of Clause 146(3) and (4) from the Bill and the insertion in Clause 144 of a new subsection which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In applying to the Competition Commission for permission to bring an appeal under this section, the grounds of appeal must be set out in the application in sufficient detail to indicate&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-30_para9"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) to what extent (if any) the appellant contends that the decision appealed against was based on an error of fact or was wrong in law or both; and
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-30_para10"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) to what extent (if any) the appellant is appealing against the exercise of a discretion by GEMA".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-30_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40301-30_para12"></a>In line with the approach taken in the communications industry, the amendment would require appellants to specify only whether they allege an error of fact or law in the original decision or whether they are complaining about how the authority has exercised its discretion.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para13"></a>On the actual language of the Bill, even looking at the Government's purported solution from the narrow grounds of the common law of judicial review, we find that the Government's provisions fall well short of what is required. The list of grounds at Clause 146(4), although derived from judicial review, are an incomplete reflection of the grounds of challenge available in that form of action. Notably, the four categories mentioned do not include the unreasonableness of the decision, even in the limited sense set out in the textbook Wednesbury case, or lack of proportionality. Indeed, the absence of the latter criterion may, in certain circumstances, have the effect of rendering the appeal procedure incompatible with the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998, contrary to the formal statement made by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para14"></a>Those limitations are significant because judicial review is a discretionary remedy, which is not generally available if a specific statutory alternative exists. That means that the effects of the Bill are, first, to remove an existing right and, as it does not appear to replace it by something that is at least equivalent, secondly, to substitute an inferior right. Therefore, the overall effect is to derogate from the rights of the industry and of consumers in an area where the Government have accepted that they most need to be enhanced. In that context, we have provided a second, alternative, more modest amendment to Amendments Nos. 131ZC and 131B in the shape of Amendment No. 131C, which inserts the criteria of reasonableness and proportionality.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para15"></a>We regard this amendment as being less desirable than the first but nevertheless enhancing the rights of any appellant. No appeals mechanism under the Bill as it stands, whether it will be dignified by the description of appeal or otherwise, will be able effectively to strengthen the rights of energy industry participants, including consumers, in relation to regulatory decisions, unless it provides for the appeals body to conclude that, in its opinion, Ofgem's discretion should have been exercised differently in all the circumstances of the case.
<P>


<a name="column_GC155"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para16"></a>I now turn more briefly, as I am sure your Lordships will be relieved to hear, to deal with the remaining amendments. As far as Amendments Nos. 131ZA and 131ZB are concerned, Clause 144(3) provides that those who have the right to appeal against a decision of the authority must be "materially affected" by the decision. The more usual approach to the question of eligibility in this sort of context is to require that those with a right to appeal must have a "sufficient interest", something which has been elaborated by case law and interpreted generously.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para17"></a>The focus in the Bill on being materially affected rather than having sufficient interest suggests that the policy objective is to restrict, significantly, the class of persons able to bring an appeal. For example, there is no guarantee under the Bill's approach that all the parties to an industry code would be equally entitled to appeal in relation to a particular decision. This would be, in my view, an erosion of rights which is undesirable as a matter of principle. Accordingly, therefore, the amendments aim to ensure that persons with a sufficient interest in the regulatory decision will be entitled to appeal against it.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para18"></a>On Amendment No. 131ZD, one of the defining features of those decisions of the authority that are to be subject to appeal is that they must be taken in relation to a document that the Secretary of State has designated, by order, under subsection (2)(b) of Clause 144. Subsection (6) puts a duty on the Secretary of State, before making that order, to consult, first, Ofgem, and, secondly, such other persons as he considers appropriate. This is far too discretionary.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para19"></a>Given the crucial importance of the designating power, it is only right that the parties to the documents to be designated&#151;in other words, the market participants&#151;should be clearly specified as a category of persons that must be consulted in all cases. The appropriate formula would therefore be that the Secretary of State be required to consult: first, the authority; secondly, the parties to the documents that he is minded to designate under subsection (2)(b); and, thirdly, such other persons as he considers appropriate. In my submission, our amendment would achieve that result.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para20"></a>As to Amendments Nos. 131ZE and 131ZF, Schedule 22 sets out in meticulous detail the procedure to be followed for appeals raised under Clause 144. Schedule 22(1)(3) requires an appellant to apply to the Competition Commission for permission to bring an appeal within 10 days of the relevant Ofgem decision. This requirement has been set in such a narrow time limit as to be unworkable in practice. In effect, within the space of 10 working days parties must assimilate the Ofgem decision and the reasons for it; take advice on the prospects for successful appeal; obtain a senior-level decision on whether or not to appeal; and compile a full and complete statement of their case.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para21"></a>The 10-day time limit would be tight, even if that limit related only to the time within which an indication of intent to appeal had to be given. No <P>


<a name="column_GC156"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>company will lightly commence an appeal and is most unlikely to require board level approval for any such decision. In short, this time limit is wholly unrealistic.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para22"></a>Furthermore, it contrasts unfavourably with the 20 working days given to the authority later in the schedule to undertake the lesser task of submitting its own observations on the appeal, and it takes no account of the dire consequences of paragraph 7 of the schedule. The effect of paragraph 7 is to remove any certainty that, at a later stage, an appellant will be able to raise issues that were not outlined in his initial request for permission. The result, in practice, is that it will be essential for the request for permission to contain a full and complete statement of all the bases for appeal.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para23"></a>While it is of course desirable for the appeals process to be undertaken and conducted swiftly, the particular time requirement of paragraph 1(3) is severely overly restrictive and likely to be unfair in its operation and to be prejudicial to appellants. It is inappropriate for the period of time within which an application for permission to appeal must be made to be anything less than 20 working days.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para24"></a>In addition, it is not good practice to provide that the timetable starts to run from the earliest day on which the decision is published by the authorities. There are many ways to publish a decision, all of which are not guaranteed to draw the matter to the attention of the relevant parties. It is therefore important that the time should not start to run until the decision has been published in such a way that it is likely to be seen by all potential appellants.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para25"></a>I turn, finally, to Amendment No. 131A. Schedule 22(14)(2) allows the Secretary of State to modify by order any time period specified for the purposes of the appeals procedure set out in the schedule, subject only to the negative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="40301-30_para26"></a>The appeals provisions of the Bill undermine and weaken existing legal rights by effectively removing parties access to action by way of judicial review for the reasons I have already explained. It is therefore quite unacceptable for an order-making power, which could be used restrictively, further to limit legal rights to be subject only to negative resolution. At the very least, the power should be subject to a no lesser safeguard than that of the affirmative procedure. It would be even better to subject the power to the special procedure for delegated power that is provided for at Amendment No. 146B, and so Amendment No. 131A is framed accordingly. I beg to move.

I suggested to him that on this occasion, as our shadow Lord Chancellor, he might like to speak from the Front Bench which would indicate that his views are the views of our Front Bench. That will please noble Lords opposite because I can now simply sit down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I join noble Lords on the Opposition Front Bench and those behind them in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for the clarity of the propositions that he has made. I shall not go through the amendments in the order in which he went through them. I intend to try, as best as I am able, to deal with the key themes and that may mean that I group the amendments somewhat differently, but by either route we shall get to the heart of the argument that the noble Lord has put to the Committee.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para3"></a>This is a large group of amendments. I hope I shall be able to include all those in the Marshalled List. A few moments ago I worried whether I had missed some, although I am confident that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has included them all. The amendments in this large group deal with a number of aspects of the provisions for appeals against Ofcom decisions on code modification. I shall explain how I shall deal with them.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para4"></a>First, Amendments Nos. 131ZE, 131ZF and 131A concern a number of the aspects of the procedure for appeals which are set out in Schedule 22 of the Bill; secondly, I shall address Amendments Nos. 131ZA and 131ZB, which concern the categories of person who may appeal a decision; thirdly, I shall address <P>


<a name="column_GC158"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Amendment No. 131ZD which concerns the consultation on secondary orders arising from these provisions; and fourthly, I shall address those amendments that concern the scope of the appeals procedure, the process itself and the role of the Competition Commission. I propose to address Amendments Nos. 131ZC and 131B together, as I believe that they are designed to work in unison. Having listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I believe he has made the point that they are intended to work together as well. I shall then address Amendment No. 131C and finally Amendment No. 132.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para5"></a>It may be helpful if I preface these groupings by trying to provide some definitions which I hope will be a working basis for understanding what we mean by the various terms that are used. I am conscious of the fact, particularly when dealing with an eminent lawyer, that what is meant by the word "appeal" in different contexts could be thought to mean different things. So I would like to proceed on the basis of what the Government believe they mean.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para6"></a>The debate in the area can become systematically and semantically confusing. Industry parties sometimes refer to what we term "appeal by way of a rehearing" as a full appeal on the merits. To avoid confusion, I want to describe what we are providing as an appeal by way of a review on the merits to distinguish it from an appeal by way of a rehearing and to avoid the language of a full appeal on the merits, one of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, in his submission about what it might or might not be appropriate to do.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para7"></a>I also want to deal with one or two other definitions which have come up in your Lordships' debate on the Bill on a few occasions and which I, with the greatest respect, feel could do with a little more definition as well. We have all, on all sides of this debate, referred to the desirability of transparency and, in the course of today's debate, particularly to accountability. I am aware that much of what I will have to say will also deal in a slightly more elaborate way with the concept of proportionality&#151;that any action should be in proportion to the risk and that the penalties should be in proportion to the harm done. Otherwise, I fear we will be looking at processes in a way that could lead to a far greater than proportionate response and, of course, part of our debate is about whether it is proportionate or not. For those reasons, I prefer the clarity.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para8"></a>I also hope that what I have to say will bear on consistency and targeting. If we are to talk about principles of good regulation, those are also important principles to observe as we try to construct a legal framework.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para9"></a>With that preamble, let me start with Amendment No. 131ZE. I am grateful to the noble Lords Opposite for this amendment; I am aware that the initial period of time in which to bring an appeal is something about which a number of parties in the industry have had real concerns. Many of those have been highlighted by the representations made this afternoon. In particular, the <P>


<a name="column_GC159"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has talked about the time that will be needed for a process, the time that will be needed for a full board consideration of such a process, and so on. I took careful note of all that he said.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para10"></a>I stress that our principal concern remains to ensure that the appeals process is proportionate&#151;I defined proportionate a few moments ago&#151;and does not introduce unnecessary regulatory uncertainty and delay. That benefits nobody. Generally, I remain satisfied that the timescales are suitable for the process we are providing. I am concerned that doubling the period in which it would be unclear to market participants whether a decision is to be subject to an appeal, as envisaged by the amendment, would unduly increase the degree of regulatory uncertainty to which I have just referred. However, I have concluded that we might usefully look again at the length of the initial period in which parties can make an application for permission to appeal to the Competition Commission. I therefore propose to take the matter away for further consideration and to come back to the question at Report.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para11"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 131ZF. This amendment to Schedule 22 would require Ofgem to publish its code modification decision,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in a manner which is appropriate for bringing it to the attention of persons likely to be affected by it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-31_para12"></a>
The proposers will be aware that the processes for code modifications are currently laid out in the licence conditions relating to a particular code and the various codes themselves. Section 49A of the Electricity Act 1989 and Section 38A of the Gas Act 1986 require Ofgem to publish reasons for any direction or consent it gives in pursuance of a licence condition which includes code modifications. That matter was covered in part by our debates in the last meeting of the Grand Committee, which I believe noble Lords will find at col. 105 of the Official Report.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para13"></a>The reasons for Ofgem's decision are to be published in a manner such as Ofgem considers appropriate for the purpose of bringing the matter to the attention of persons likely to be interested. Pursuant to Section 49A(3) of the Electricity Act and Section 38A(3) of the Gas Act, Ofgem also sends a letter with a copy of the decision and Ofgem's reasons for the decision to every licence holder to whose licence or to whom the decision relates. Therefore, our view is that the amendment is unnecessary. The provision exists in legislation and, again, I urge noble Lords to look at those provisions in other legislation to satisfy themselves that the matters are covered and that my contention is a good one.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para14"></a>Amendment No. 131A relates to the provision of a special procedure for the exercise of the power contained in paragraph 14 of Schedule 22, which enables the modification of the time limits which apply for the purposes of appeals to the Competition Commission against decisions of GEMA under Clause 144. That power is limited to substituting different time limits for the ones in Schedule 22 and is subject to the negative procedure, as Members of the Committee will have observed. Amendment No. 131A would <P>


<a name="column_GC160"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>introduce a mandatory parliamentary consultation on a draft order before a draft statutory instrument could be laid before the House.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para15"></a>According to my recollection, we have already discussed this kind of provision on a significant number of occasions in this Grand Committee&#151;on Amendments Nos. 119D, 144A, 146A and 146B. I do not believe that it would add a great deal to reiterate all the arguments from those previous debates this afternoon, beyond saying that paragraph 14 of Schedule 22 is far removed from the type of power for which Parliament has considered that a special procedure should apply.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para16"></a>We believe that the Competition Commission review of the regulator's decision, which I have described, strikes the right balance. The Government's concern throughout has been to find a proportionate appeal mechanism. That requires increasing accountability for code modification decisions without undermining the independence of Ofgem as a sector regulator or introducing undue regulatory uncertainty or delay. The appeals mechanism provided for in the Bill is a proportionate policy solution. I shall say a little more in due course about how the mechanism compares with judicial review and why the process is different for licence condition appeals&#151;all matters which, quite properly, were raised.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para17"></a>I now turn to the amendments concerned with the categories of people who can appeal. Amendments Nos. 131ZA and 131ZB seek to replace the requirement for appellants to be parties "materially affected" by a decision with a lesser requirement that they be parties,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with a sufficient interest in that decision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-31_para18"></a>
The parties here may be legal persons or bodies representing them, such as Energywatch. Indeed, a number of other possible examples are cited in the Explanatory Notes.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para19"></a>I am aware that some within the industry are concerned that "materially affected" represents too narrow a test. I hope that I can use this opportunity to allay some fears on that point. While it may be a matter for the Competition Commission to consider whether a party bringing an application is "materially affected", we envisage that, in the case of the appeals process, it will include industry participants who are parties to the codes and it could include groups of consumers or even, conceivably, major individual consumers.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para20"></a>I find it difficult to imagine what additional parties the proposers would hope to allow to appeal, but if any were to emerge the Competition Commission would be able to decide whether they met the test. It follows that, in our view, this amendment is unnecessary. The formulation as drafted in the Bill is a proportionate solution. The proposition is a disproportionate solution.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para21"></a>Amendment No. 131ZD seeks to require the Secretary of State to consult the parties to the codes which we intend to be within the scope of appeals before making any orders under this section of the Bill. <P>


<a name="column_GC161"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I agree with the proposers that it is right that the Secretary of State should consult parties to these codes. However, such persons would be caught by the existing requirement for the Secretary of State to consult,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such other persons as he considers appropriate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-31_para22"></a>
The amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para23"></a>I turn to the important issue of the scope of the appeals mechanism and the role that the Competition Commission will play. I have already made one brief comment on the matter. Noble Lords may be aware that this is an area of considerable interest&#151;and for very obvious reasons&#151;to the industry. There are differences of opinion between industry players about the issues. While some are pressing for a much broader right to appeal than we are providing, others do not agree with that broadening. Centrica, for example, is opposed to broadening the scope of the appeals process and has indicated that it is "fully supportive" of the provisions as drafted. National Grid Transco has taken a similar position. There is no unanimity about the process in that sense.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para24"></a>I intend to address the various amendments relating to this issue before setting out the Government's thinking and the way forward. I propose to address Amendments Nos. 131ZC and 131B together as they are designed to work in unison.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para25"></a>Amendment No. 131ZC would require appellants to set out the detailed grounds for their appeal in their application for permission to appeal. Amendment No. 131B would remove subsections (3) and (4) of Clause 146 which set out what evidence the Competition Commission may have regard to when determining an appeal and grounds on which it may find that a decision was wrong.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para26"></a>The joint effect of Amendments Nos. 131ZC and 131B would be to mirror the provisions in the Communications Act, a point that was made to us. The effect would be that the appeals process might in some cases amount to a rehearing. On the basis of the amendments, it is hard to see that it could lead in another direction. This would broaden the scope of the appeals process unacceptably and introduce an unacceptable level of regulatory uncertainty and delay. We do not consider that to be an appropriate approach here.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para27"></a>Amendment No. 131C seems to be designed to achieve a similar end to Amendments Nos. 131ZC and 131B. I should apologise for the alphabet soup. I hope that everyone can follow it; it appears to be trying to do the same thing by a different route. I would add that an additional ground for appeal would significantly widen the potential scope of the appeals process. Again, I do not consider the amendment to be appropriate as it would introduce an unacceptable level of regulatory uncertainty and delay, and that cannot be a proportionate solution.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para28"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 132. I am aware that this amendment appeared before some of the earlier ones and therefore I want to try to reflect on it with some care as it may have implications for amendments that appear later.
<P>


<a name="column_GC162"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para29"></a>The amendment would add an extra ground on which a code modification could succeed. It is proposed that an appeal might succeed where a decision was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"so unreasonable that no reasonable regulator would make it".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-31_para30"></a>
That is what is known as "Wednesbury unreasonableness"&#151;from the case in which it was defined.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para31"></a>I assure Members of the Committee that it is intended that, were Ofgem to act with "Wednesbury unreasonableness" in reaching a decision, an appeal against that decision should succeed. The provisions are designed to allow for a review of Ofgem's decision, and one way in which an applicant might succeed would be by showing that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no reasonable regulator would have taken such a decision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-31_para32"></a><P>

<a name="40301-31_para33"></a>However, I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that his amendment has given us occasion further to examine whether the provisions as drafted could usefully be clarified. That is why I made the point, without commitment, to think about the matter in terms of some of the amendments that came later. I am aware that there may still be a lack of clarity as to exactly what form of appeals mechanism is being proposed here. I take this opportunity to clarify what the Government intend and to explain why we believe that our provisions strike the right balance. However, we shall consider whether to table a government amendment on Report to ensure that the policy intention is as clearly expressed as it can be.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para34"></a>The Government's concern in this area has been to find a proportionate appeals mechanism, reflecting industry concerns in consultation responses that the mechanism would need to strike the right balance. The mechanism, as drafted, is intended to do just that. It provides for an appeal by way of a review of the decision of Ofgem on its merits but it falls short of providing for a full rehearing or investigation of all the issues by the Competition Commission. The Competition Commission will review Ofgem's decision against the objectives of the code in question and Ofgem's statutory duties, as well as reviewing whether the decision was correct in fact and in law.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para35"></a>Clause 146 provides that the appeal can be allowed if the Competition Commission is satisfied that a decision was "wrong" on certain specified grounds. The word "wrong" here is significant as it reflects the fact that the Competition Commission should adopt the same approach as would, for example, the Court of Appeal in hearing an appeal against a decision of a lower court. In that situation, the civil procedure rules which govern procedure in our civil courts make it clear that the appellate court may intervene when a lower court has made a decision which was "wrong". Those rules go on to elaborate what it means for a decision to be "wrong" by reference to various decided cases&#151;in particular, the House of Lords case of G v G in 1985.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para36"></a>In relation to the exercise of discretion by the regulator, it means that Ofgem is able to set its policy in order to reach decisions but, in circumstances in which it chooses from a number of possible options to <P>


<a name="column_GC163"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>implement its policy, the Competition Commission will be able to review those options. If the Competition Commission considers that in relation to the exercise of a discretion by Ofgem there is a permissible approach different from the one taken by Ofgem, then, before the Competition Commission can hold that Ofgem had erred, it must first ask itself two questions. It must ask itself, first, whether the other permissible approach is better and, secondly, whether the difference between its view and that of Ofgem falls outside the boundaries of reasonable disagreement. The Competition Commission can say that Ofgem's decision was "wrong" only if it satisfies both those criteria.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para37"></a>The Competition Commission will therefore look at the substance of the decision and not only at the process by which it was reached. That was one of the key burdens of the points put forward in Committee today. It should be clearly understood that there is no matter on which Ofgem has discretion to review a code modification that will not fall within the scope of the Competition Commission's powers of review. However, the Competition Commission will not hold a rehearing requiring it to rework all the analysis. That would add substantially to the length of the process and introduce an unacceptable level of regulatory uncertainty and delay.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para38"></a>It will be clear to your Lordships from this analysis that what we intend therefore is a tailored appeals mechanism. It is different from judicial review, which does not allow a review of the merits of the decision in the manner proposed here. It is also different from a full rehearing of the case, such as is possible within the scope of the provisions in the electronic communications sector. It is a tailored mechanism, and we believe that it should be a tailored mechanism. I am confident that it will suit the purpose for which it is designed. That is why I mentioned the kinds of criteria at the beginning that should be applied, including consistency.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para39"></a>However, on re-examining the provisions in the light of the noble Lord's amendment, we have concluded that the provisions as drafted could be usefully clarified to make more explicit what we intend. I therefore wish to agree to consider Amendment No. 132 with the provision I have made about amendments that have arrived subsequently and examine whether an alternative formulation would better express the policy intention I have described. But I hope that noble Lords will feel&#151;and I apologise for the length in setting the issue out&#151;that the objectives are ones that have been put to us. In that light, I hope that the amendments can be withdrawn.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for his thorough response to the submissions I made in my opening speech. As far as concerns Amendment No. 131ZE&#151;the amendment that deals with time limits for appeal&#151;the Minister was kind enough to say that he would go away and reflect on the matter between now and Report. I should like to say how grateful I am to <P>


<a name="column_GC164"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord for responding in that way. He reflected on the importance of proportionality in procedural as well as substantive matters. I, of course, agree with him; but I hope that he will reach the conclusion between now and the Report stage that, after mature consideration, the principle of proportionality is not properly respected by a time limit of a mere 10 days.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para40"></a>Secondly, the Minister dealt with Amendment No. 131ZF, the amendment that refers to publications. He argued, with considerable force, that the amendment was unnecessary. The provision contained in the Bill is a common provision, used in other legislation; and as far as he could recall no problems had arisen in those respects. I shall go away and look at the examples he cited and reflect on whether I should return to the matter on Report.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para41"></a>As far as concerns Amendment No. 131A&#151;the amendment that deals with the modification of time limits by negative order&#151;I am bound to say that the amendment is important to us because of the very restrictive approach the Government have taken in the Bill. Had the Government been more balanced in the way they approached the time limit issue in relation to appeals, we may have been less concerned about the fact that those time limits could be altered by negative order. In other words, our concern that even tighter time limits might follow from those already in the Bill is to some degree reflected in our amendment on the negative order.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para42"></a>On Amendments Nos. 131ZA and 131ZE&#151;the amendments which relate to the parties affected&#151;I drew some comfort from the Minister's statement, on the record, that the parties envisaged would include industrial participants, who are parties to the code, groups of consumers or major individual consumers. That is a helpful response. I am grateful to the Minister for that. In the light of that response, between now and Report stage I shall reflect on whether it would be appropriate for me to re-table the amendments in their existing or in some other form.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para43"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 131ZD, the amendment which draws the Committee's attention to the issue of consultation. The Minister said, in effect, "What are you worried about?". The clause in the Bill is cast very widely. That is precisely why I am worried about it. A clause cast too widely can often be as dangerous, or more dangerous, to the individual as a clause cast too narrowly. The concern here is that the degree of discretion given is such that it would be extremely difficult to pin a public authority down in any legal action if it were exercised in an irresponsible way. I have heard what the Minister says and I shall also think again about the amendment before Report stage.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para44"></a>I now turn to what I believe we all consider to be the most important amendments in this group: those concerned with the definition of appeal. The Minister helpfully reflected aloud on what the Bill intended to achieve. If I understand him correctly, he said that it was more than judicial review but less than a full rehearing on the merits. He used the expression "a tailored approach"; others might call it a half way <P>


<a name="column_GC165"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>house or a one third of the way house or a three quarters of the way house between judicial review and a full rehearing. The Minister was also kind enough to say that he will reconsider the text of the Bill between now and Report stage to see whether or not the tailored approach that was sought to be achieved in the Bill reflects exactly the position the noble Lord seeks on the spectrum between judicial review and a full rehearing.
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para45"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for saying that and we shall look with interest to see what emerges at Report stage. I have two reflections in conclusion. The first one is that we still need from the Government to hear what it is about this Bill, and the appeal procedure contained in it, that makes it different from the appeal procedure contained in the Communications Act. Why is the gas and electricity industry different from the communications industry? Why are the appellant's rights so much weaker in the gas and the electricity industries than in the communications industry?
<P>

<a name="40301-31_para46"></a>My second point is simply that if the Minister looks at what is in the Bill, I think it is fair to say that, on a reasonable construction of its words, he will conclude that what is in the Bill is less than judicial review. The statutory procedure is even narrower than judicial review. If I am right about that, I should be confident that at Report stage we shall see some different words in the Bill from those that we see now.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   Before my noble friend withdraws the amendment, I should just like to say that I am most grateful for what the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, said about my amendment. With my noble friend Lord Kingsland, I look forward to seeing what the Government produce on Report. I would also ask the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, to make no apology for the length of his response. It is a hugely important matter, and I thought that he dealt with it extremely effectively. But, of course, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating at Report stage. I am most grateful.

My noble friend asked a question and it is one that I should like to ask, too. We must be absolutely clear about what happens in this matter. I want to be clear about it because those of us who are not professionals in the electricity industry&#151;I do not believe that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, is one either&#151;find it difficult to follow what the Government are doing in relation to the proposals that we have heard from various parts of the industry. Can the Minister confirm that here the various categories of lines are being brought into line and that the 132-kilovolt lines can be counted as transmission? Does that apply all over the country and does it meet the submission made by the Scottish generators?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-32_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   It is difficult to relate this matter to the part of the Bill to which it refers, but we are dealing with offshore transmissions here. As the noble Baroness knows, there is a difference between the voltage in Scotland and that in England and Wales. Without referring to the original text of the Bill, the amendment defines the somewhat different situation in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-32_spnew8"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   Perhaps the Minister could write to me about that matter. With regard to the high voltage lines, the amendment states,

<a name="40301-32_para24"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope not to take too long in moving this amendment, but the Minister will recognise that some history relates to this issue. The methane that escapes into the atmosphere from abandoned mines as a result of what I believe is now recognised as microbial degradation seeps up through faults and cracks in the earth and poisons the atmosphere. The question is whether that gas should receive the special treatment awarded to other forms of methane escape&#151;for example, in landfill&#151;and qualify for support through the renewables obligation.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para25"></a>I believe one has to start from the proposition that coal mine methane is a hazardous waste gas. It is possible to exemplify that by reminding noble Lords that it is not so long since a small town in Derbyshire&#151;Arkwright Town&#151;had to be demolished because it had become uninhabitable as a result of coal mine methane escaping into the surrounding atmosphere. It is also recognised as hazardous because housing in many areas&#151;in particular, in mining areas&#151;is still blighted by coal mine methane. That issue must be dealt with. If one compares it with, for example, the fuss that was made some years ago about the problem of radon in ordinary dwellings&#151;I suspect that that was many, many times less hazardous than the methane which escapes into the atmosphere from abandoned mines&#151;I believe one can make a case for saying that it must be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para26"></a>In addition, dealing with coal mine methane would be entirely in accordance with the Government's overall environmental objectives. Such methane has what I might call a "global warming potential" 23 times greater than carbon dioxide. That has been well established and is not challenged by anybody. Therefore, if this waste gas can be captured and used for generation, it cuts its global warming potential&#151;its GWP&#151;by more than 100 per cent. It saves nine times more CO <sub>2</sub> e equivalent per kilowatt hour than is generated by wind power. I shall come back to that point in a few minutes.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para27"></a>Coal mine methane is therefore a clean, strategic source of energy with the potential to contribute perhaps up to 450 megawatts of generation capacity by 2010, the equivalent of hundreds of large wind turbines.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para28"></a>In this country, investment in capturing and using coal mine methane is virtually on hold. In contrast, the German Government fully support this new carbon mitigation technology and the industry there is now booming. There is investment; it is expanding; the methane is being captured; and more than 120 megawatts of power is now already in store there, using CMM.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para29"></a>An extension of the renewables obligation from 10.4 per cent to 11.4 per cent would help the Government to meet their target and help a struggling industry which was, at one time, recognised by Ministers as a viable infant industry. It is the sort of industry we ought to be dealing with to establish our position here and to deal with a very real problem.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para30"></a>Over the past two or three years, this case has been made to many noble Lords and Members of another place by the very active body, the Association of Coal <P>


<a name="column_GC169"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Mine Methane Operators. I took it upon myself, some two or three years ago, to establish a small, all-party group in this House to see Ministers and make the case. The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, was a very distinguished member of that group. Two other members are, sadly, no longer with us&#151;Lord Hardy of Wath and Lord Dormand of Easington. Both came from coal mine areas and both knew very much what they were talking about. I was very grateful to have their support.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para31"></a>We went to see Ministers at the DTI&#151;Brian Wilson was then the Minister for Energy. We went to see Ministers at the Department of the Environment&#151;in particular, Michael Meacher. Neither of those Ministers are still in that position. I eventually went to see the Chief Secretary to the Treasury&#151;pulling rank, in a sense, because it was a job which I held about 20 years ago&#151;and Paul Boateng was very kind in seeing me.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para32"></a>All those Ministers had one thing in common&#151;they expressed a very keen desire to help. They appeared to recognise the strength of our case and each, in respect of their own responsibilities, was concerned to make it clear to them and, in some cases, to their officials, that this needed to be done. Indeed, when we went to see Michael Meacher and said that coal mine methane ought to be brought within the emissions trading scheme, he apologised to us that it was even necessary for us to come and make that case. However, nothing has happened, with the exception of the Treasury agreeing to exempt coal mine methane from the climate change levy. As I put it at a meeting of the ACCMO a little later, that was one down and two to go. There is no proper incentive to develop coal mine methane such as the renewables obligations will provide, and there is as yet no access for coal mine methane operators to any of the emissions trading schemes.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para33"></a>This really is a disgraceful state of affairs. It is also completely illogical. My right honourable friend Kenneth Clarke when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer established the regime for landfill gas&#151;that is, methane. The landfill arrangements&#151;the tax and all the other arrangements that go with it&#151;are now an integral part of the public arrangements for dealing with energy and escaping gas. That is something which needed to be built on. But when we pointed out on the Floor of the House to the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, who at that stage was still answering questions about energy, which at the moment he does not seem to do&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, will remember this&#151;that the Germans had had no difficulty in extending their renewables obligation to coal mine methane, he said that we would not be so stupid, thereby both disappointing everyone in the House and insulting the Germans.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para34"></a>It was an extraordinary decision that something which another member of the Community felt perfectly able to do was apparently impossible for us to do. It is completely illogical that methane captured from landfill sites and sewage farms was included in <P>


<a name="column_GC170"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the renewables obligation while chemically identical methane captured from abandoned coal mines was excluded.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para35"></a>Another point, which I think the Chief Secretary recognised when I met him, is that an increased renewables obligation would cost the Treasury nothing and add less than 0.6 per cent to consumers' electricity bills by 2010. Contrast that with the position of methane captured from working collieries. This was given a £21 million subsidy in the UK emissions trading scheme incentives auction. For some reason, coal mine methane from abandoned mines was excluded by the department of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para36"></a>At the draft stage of the DTI independent consultants' study into support for CMM, the conclusion was that including this waste gas in the renewables obligation was the best method. I understand that when the report comes to be published, that recommendation from the independent consultants is due to be excised.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para37"></a>The inclusion of CMM in an increased renewables obligation is supported by the Renewable Power Association, the Welsh Assembly, several of the regional development agencies and, as I said, a cross-party coalition of noble Lords and Members of another place.
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para38"></a>Three years ago in 2001, the British industry in this area was well ahead of the Germans. It has now fallen behind and is stagnating. One has to ask, is this yet another case of British technology with a world-wide lead being overtaken by overseas competitors because of a lack of support by officialdom in this country?
<P>

<a name="40301-32_para39"></a>I think there is an overwhelming case that coal mine methane should benefit from the renewables obligation. I am tempted to guess why it is that Ministers can express such huge support for this proposition when we go to see them but still fail to do anything about it. I believe the reason is that they see&#151;as with combined heat and power, which is another similar example&#151;it as impinging on their targets for wind energy. Noble Lords may not have had the chance to read the recent report that I believe was published just before the weekend on renewable energy. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, will have seen it. The report states just how difficult it will be for the Government to achieve their renewable energy targets, not just by 2010 but by 2015 and beyond. It also talked about the innumerable steps that now need to be taken if those targets are going to be met. I can well understand the attraction of an argument put to Ministers&#151;

<FONT SIZE=3>renewables obligation for coal mine methane. I suggested that one reason was the extent to which it achieved the CO <sub>2</sub>  objectives and would draw off some of the renewables obligation money, thus impacting adversely on wind power.
<P>

<a name="40301-33_para0"></a>I have received a comment on this issue from a director of a consulting firm, who writes:
<P>

<a name="40301-33_para5"></a>In their energy White Paper, the Government set as their central target the reduction of CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions in order to play a part in resolving the global climate change problem. Therefore, I simply do not understand why they find that they cannot give such an emission, which is 23 times as damaging as an ordinary CO <sub>2</sub>  emission, the necessary help to make the industry effective in this country. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I have much pleasure in supporting Amendment No. 132A, so effectively moved by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding. I have had the pleasure of sitting on the joint group of Peers, which he has led for some years and which promotes this concept. Like him, I was much impressed by the way that the Ministers, whom we met, accepted the case. But, as soon as the case went into the back office, somehow or other the validity which the Ministers saw in it disappeared.
<P>

<a name="40301-33_para6"></a>I am as perplexed as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is and as, I am sure, are most noble Lords in the Grand Committee as to why there is this rearguard action to prevent such a desirable activity being pursued. Here we are talking of the escape of a really lethal gas, far more lethal to the environment than CO <sub>2</sub> , which could easily be dealt with&#151;and that is being dealt with under the larger schemes. But there are now a number of smaller schemes, which, without specific support, cannot go ahead, but in aggregate would amount to a good deal of CO <sub>2</sub>  reduction. The case of Germany stands out, as that country has forged ahead, and British firms in the sector, disappointed at the lack of support in Britain, have moved there to develop their interests.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40301-33_para7"></a>It is incumbent on Ministers, unless they are prepared to accept the amendment, to let us know what lies behind the Government's objections to it which seem totally contradictory to their environmental policy as set out in the energy White Paper. We should be quite clear what the reasoning is. The case for doing what is suggested is so compelling and the cost for doing it is so small, that it is very difficult to see how objections to the amendment can be sustained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Noble Lords have made a strong case for regarding coal mine methane as something that could positively contribute to an energy policy. Indeed, there are aspects of government policy that already support that, and others that we are considering. What Noble Lords have not made the case for, and what is the basic objection to the amendment, is for coal mine methane to be treated as a renewable. It is not a renewable but a gas extracted from a fossil fuel. There is an argument about displacing support for other renewables, but there is also a legal and definitional point that we would not be able to obtain state aid approval, which would include the recycling of the fossil fuel fund, to support a technology under the renewables obligation, because it is not classified as a renewable under the renewables directive. There are both common-sense and legal reasons why we cannot regard coal mine methane as a renewable.
<P>

<a name="40301-33_para8"></a>The Government certainly recognise and value the benefits that coal mine methane provides through the tapping of emissions from abandoned and working mines and putting them to beneficial use. The Government have already demonstrated their support for that through the exemption from the climate change levy in last year's Budget, to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred. That was approved by the European Commission and came into effect on 1 November. The energy White Paper also accepts the need to control CMM emissions and promises that we shall work with the industry and relevant environmental organisations to ensure that is done effectively. To that end, the DTI has commissioned a study to see whether any possible market mechanisms would be consistent with the aims of the White Paper and could be deployed to control the emissions. That study will report soon.
<P>

<a name="40301-33_para9"></a>The fact remains that coal mine methane cannot in the normal sense be regarded as renewable. Even when used for power generation it still emits carbon dioxide, so it cannot be said to be a clean fuel, although it does have advantages in relation to direct burning of carbon. However, it cannot be classified as a renewable fuel.
<P>

<a name="40301-33_para10"></a>The experience in Germany has been referred to. The German approach to coal mine methane is not one that we or other member states are seeking to follow, for the very reason that it effectively treats methane as a renewable, but not a renewable under the terms of the renewables obligation. The feed-in tariff, which is the mechanism used in Germany for support of coal <P>


<a name="column_GC173"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC173</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mine methane, is not state aid as the renewables obligation is regarded as being, specifically with regard to the recycling of the buy-out fund.
<P>

<a name="40301-33_para11"></a>There are also difficulties with the trading scheme, to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, also referred. With regard to a working mine, the amount of methane emitted can be measured and the benefit can also be measured. However, there is no measurable benefit from abandoned mines. While working mine methane is measurable, that would provide a basis on which to quantify the improvement in and the contribution to carbon saving through the emissions trading scheme. In addition to the DTI study to which I referred earlier, Defra has commissioned a separate study to determine a baseline for methane emissions which could enable coal mine methane to qualify for the emissions trading scheme and hence for the industry to receive a value for the emissions avoided through their use within the trading scheme context.
<P>

<a name="40301-33_para12"></a>We are aware that the argument made by the industry for extending the renewables obligation has been made very forcefully and very frequently. However, as the energy White Paper emphasised, the renewables obligation has a specific aim&#151;to develop long-term, carbon-free generation technologies to the point where they become economically viable in their own right. Offering the obligation more widely risks undermining that longer term objective. To extend it specifically to methane extraction would be difficult to justify since you would then have to make a further calculation regarding how much methane leaks naturally and how much is extracted by the process of recovery which would not otherwise have been emitted. That form of measurement, which would feed back into the baseline of the calculations for the trading scheme, is also covered by the study commissioned by Defra.
<P>

<a name="40301-33_para13"></a>However, the basic objection&#151;as opposed to any great conspiracy theory&#151;to not using this mechanism to support the coal methane industry is that in no circumstances, either in logic or in law, could coal mine methane be regarded as a renewable fuel. There are, of course, safety issues, to which the noble Lord referred when he mentioned the Arkwright coal mine, which have to be taken into account by those responsible for such issues and for environmental controls, principally under the heading of health and safety. However, the environmental benefit of coal mine methane will not be able to be supported through its inclusion in the renewables obligation. There may be other ways in which we can support it, but not that way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-33_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response to my noble friend's amendment but I am very puzzled. The Minister clearly said that at the end of the day it comes down to money and what money is allowed or is not allowed, and that the measure&#151;I believe that I interpret him correctly&#151;would fall foul of the state aid rule if we applied it in the way that my noble friend wishes. Therefore, my question to the Minister is, how does Germany do it? Why can Germany do something but we are not allowed to do it? We are all in the same Community battling under the same rules. I am absolutely intrigued by the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-34_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Even so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   In order to benefit from the renewables obligation, we have to specify technologies that are specified in the renewables directive. That is not the way that the Germans are supporting the coal methane industry. They are doing it by means of a system which they refer to as a "feed-in tariff", which results in favourable pricing of the methane connection into the system. However, the German scheme does not include coal mine methane under a renewables obligation. That is no different. That is what would fall foul of the state aid rules, from which support for renewables has to have an exemption. It can only be those renewables that are referred to in the renewables directive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I can understand the distinction which the Minister is drawing. If the renewables obligation defines technologies, I can understand why that is not a route we can use. However, why can we not use the route that the Germans use&#151;which, although it is obviously outwith that, appears to be acceptable?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   This may not be an entirely satisfactory answer, but the bit of the renewables obligation which would benefit coal mine methane concerns recycling of the fossil fuel fund. By any definition, that is clearly state aid. The feed-in tariff is not state aid because effectively no money is forgone or provided to the coal mine methane sector. Therefore, it does not fall foul of the state aid obligations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I have listened very carefully to the debate and I feel that noble Lords opposite have a point. Why can we not do what the Germans do regardless of the renewables obligation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-34_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Even if we could do what the Germans do, that is not what this amendment says. This amendment is calling for its use. So even if I accepted my noble friend's strictures on this, I could not accept this amendment. We would therefore have to return to the issue, as I suspect we will do in any case. However, tariff structures&#151;unlike a straight payment&#151;are not part of the normal definition of state aid.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para0"></a>The DTI is looking at the various options and other matters related to coal mine methane. That report should be available in a couple of months. The Defra reports will take slightly longer. We shall have to see <P>


<a name="column_GC175"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether the DTI report throws any light on this issue. Either way, I think that this amendment is ruled out in relation both to logic, as coal methane cannot really be regarded as a renewable, and to the legal provisions under state aid rules.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-34_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   It may very well be that Amendment No. 132A does not meet the definition of renewable obligation and the other points which the Minister mentioned. It may well be that we cannot do what the Germans seem to do. However, the Germans have gone right ahead with their industry in this way, while we are still thinking about it. The DTI is still thinking about ways that it can make it happen. The report may come out in two months, but it may not cover this particular matter.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para1"></a>I think that the Minister needs to go back and talk with his officials to see whether something can be done. I am quite certain that my noble friend will put his thinking cap on and find a way which is acceptable on Report. However, it would be far better if the Minister could persuade the DTI to think about how the Germans can do it. If they cannot do it within the next couple of weeks, I very much hope that they will be able to provide an answer before the Bill goes to another place for consideration there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-34_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   It seems to me that we must pursue this matter; we cannot simply leave it there. I am not convinced by the argument that this is not a renewable source. The coal reserves in this country are virtually unlimited. Be that as it may, if this is not the route to take, I believe we must seriously consider some other route and bring forward on Report something approximating the German system, which apparently does not encounter the resistance which the Government feel our amendment would meet.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para2"></a>Certainly, we cannot miss the opportunity provided by the debates on this Bill while we wait for these leisurely inquiries. After all, we have now been looking into this matter for a number of years. If the Government are really committed to a future with a low-carbon economy in Britain&#151;no one is talking about a non-carbon economy; that is impossible&#151;then this particular proposition, which would make use of colliery methane, would certainly contribute to that, and I believe we must seriously consider that option. I await with interest what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has to say on the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-34_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Before the noble Lord rises to speak, I should point out that under the climate change levy system we have provided for an exemption for methane, recognising the kind of benefit to which the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, refers. That has also been cleared by the European Commission and it does something which the Germans do not do. Therefore, we all have our different ways of approaching this matter and it is not necessarily the case that, just because the Germans are operating it, we should do exactly the same.

<FONT SIZE=3>coal mine methane in this country are now emigrating to Germany. That is what they are doing. A few of the big ones may still be here but all the rest are deciding that, if they are to develop and use this technology, they must go to Germany.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para3"></a>I should have found the Minister's reply mildly more acceptable if he had shown one iota of sympathy for the case that has been made. We have found&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, will endorse this&#151;that, in private, Ministers tell us that they have every sympathy with the case that we have made. However, every time a Minister stands up in public, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has done this afternoon, he virtually bans it.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para4"></a>As my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon said, we await the reports, which may or may not be made before this Bill is enacted. However, that is not good enough. Here is a way in which the Government could hit directly at their CO <sub>2</sub>  target&#151;the central thrust of the energy White Paper. The renewables are a means to that end; they are not an end in themselves. The reduction of CO <sub>2</sub>  is the end to be achieved if we are to have an impact on climate change. Here is an equivalent source of CO <sub>2</sub>  which could be trapped and used and which would make a marked contribution to that struggle, yet nothing has been done.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para5"></a>In a sense, the climate change levy was a sop. It removed a minor disincentive&#151;that is all. However, any effective encouragement to the industry, such as the renewables obligation or, as we heard in a number of our submissions to Ministers in meetings, the equivalent of a renewables obligation&#151;that is, something of the same value but without the tag "renewable"&#151;is absent. Indeed, even since then, work has been carried out which establishes, I believe beyond doubt, that what is left behind when a mine is abandoned are not finite pockets of gas but gas produced by a continuous process of microbial action on the coal. As the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said, that lasts for hundreds of years and it will continue to be produced. It is not simply the case that, once the pockets have gone, that is the end of it.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para6"></a>What is the difference between landfill methane and that type of methane? I find this debate infinitely depressing. It will not surprise the Minister in the least to know that we shall certainly return to the matter on Report. We shall consider what he said about the apparent magic of the word "renewable", although, as I said, the microbial action is pretty well indefinite. We shall consider what the Minister said and return to the matter, and I know that I shall have support from more than one part of the House. I am most grateful for what the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, said in his brief intervention. When we return to the matter, I believe that the Minister will need to give a far better reply if he is to persuade the House not to accept our amendment. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-34_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 132B:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 149, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-34_para8"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "PUBLICATION OF DETERMINATIONS
<br>
(1) Section 36 of the Gas Act 1986 (c. 44) (keeping of register) is amended as follows.
<br>
(2) After subsection (2)(d) insert&#151;
<br>
"( ) every determination made under any provision of this Act;".
<br>
(3) Section 49 of the 1989 Act (keeping of register) is amended as follows.
<br>
(4) After subsection (2)(d) insert&#151;
<br>
"( ) every determination made under any provision of this Act;"."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-34_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: Both the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 require the energy regulator, Ofgem, to maintain a register containing the details of every determination made by him in respect of a licence. This important requirement does not extend to determinations made by Ofgem under primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para10"></a>Ofgem has extensive powers under both Acts to determine disputes. There are compelling arguments that the absence of a duty to publish such determinations is anomalous. This is particularly so in relation to Ofgem's statutory determination of disputes about standards of performance. Those powers arise under Section 33AB of the Gas Act 1986 and Section 39B of the Electricity Act 1989.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para11"></a>The formal significance of these determinations is evidenced by the fact that the legislation specifically makes them final and enforceable as if they were judgments of what used to be called a county court, and is now called a district court. Despite this, Ofgem is not obliged to publish its determinations, and does not do so.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para12"></a>This situation is not compatible with the principles of public access and regulatory transparency. It does not accord with the well known principle that if justice is to be done, it must be seen to be done.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para13"></a>This country does not subscribe to the idea of secret courts or secret judgments. It does not facilitate judicial consistency because, in these cases, Ofgem is acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. It does not enable the companies that are regulated by Ofgem to know what are the standards they will be required to follow, or whether they have been treated in the same way as other companies in the same position.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para14"></a>In other words, the present situation is not compatible with the principles of regulatory transparency and consistency to which Ofgem professes to aspire. There is nothing under the existing statutory regime which prevents Ofgem publishing its decisions and its reasons and making them available to both the two industries but also to customers who have a major interest in the enforcement of standards of performance.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para15"></a>Let me give an example of the need for publication of such decisions. In October 2002, there were widespread interruptions to electricity supplies following a major storm. Ofgem's determination of compensation affected many thousands of consumers. <P>


<a name="column_GC178"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It required certain distribution companies to make substantial compensation payments. In the case of one company alone, it amounted to £1 million.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para16"></a>The provisions of this sort of determination should in future be available to other members of the industry and to the public as of right. As I have just said, there is nothing to prevent Ofgem publishing its decisions, but it deliberately does not do so.
<P>

<a name="40301-34_para17"></a>This amendment will rectify that. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-35_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   We support the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_time0"></a><H5>5.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, is quite right: the current wording of Section 36 of the Gas Act 1986 and Section 39 of the Electricity Act 1989 gives the authority adequate direction on what should be placed on the register. Both the Electricity and Gas Acts give very specific directions about what should be placed on the register. On the one occasion when the authority was challenged, with regard to the information that had not been placed on the register, the judge made no criticism of the authority, as the relevant information had been drawn to the attention of the entire industry, in any case.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para0"></a>As the current set-up is clearly not failing, it is a little hard to see why it is necessary to make this particular change. This is a time when all of us&#151;I suspect that we can count on all noble Lords on all sides of these discussions to agree with this point&#151;are seeking to minimise the burden that legislation places on private and public sector entities. However, a blanket requirement of this kind would increase the amount of work imposed on the authority, which would be all right if there was a discernible benefit. I hope I am persuading noble Lords that in this case there would not be a discernible benefit.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para1"></a>At a later point in Committee we shall discuss better regulatory practices. The authority is fully signed up to being guided by them. The principles of better regulation themselves include the idea that one should legislate only where it is necessary to do so&#151;a point that we have mentioned in several of our discussions&#151;and that legislation should be specific and targeted. The phrases in the amendment, "every determination" and "any provision", rather suggest that there would not be the kind of targeting or specificity which would be most beneficial.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para2"></a>Overall, the requirements of the Gas and Electricity Acts for the authority to keep a register are expressed in broad terms. We believe that this approach delivers better results than if we were to be too prescriptive. The authority is committed to placing a wide range of public information on the register once such information is in final form. I believe that only the authority is in a really sound position to decide on that.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para3"></a>Of course, the register in itself would not, and should not, be the only method of finding out about the authority's decisions. The authority has a thorough process when it comes to ensuring that information is drawn to the attention of those affected. <P>


<a name="column_GC179"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I was grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for referring to the storms of 2002 because I believe that they provide interesting illustrations of what I mean. Determinations made after the storms of 2002 were put on the public register. These determinations were also provided electronically to everyone who requested them. MPs in every area affected by the storms of 2002 were also sent copies.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para4"></a>Requests for determinations are rare but, when they do come in, it is already the authority's practice to send out information to everyone who has requested it, although some information such as financial declarations is considered confidential and that is omitted. The complete determination is provided only to the parties.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para5"></a>While the current statutory requirement requires the authority only to make the contents of the register open for inspection, the practice of sending out the information is a good example of why we believe that giving the authority some discretion already produces very effective results. There seems no need for any driving force that would make us over-prescriptive.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para6"></a>I understand&#151;this seems to me to be important&#151;that no requests for determinations have ever been turned down. I hope that provides reassurance on the point. In practice the measure seems to work as the noble Baroness, from what she has said, would wish and I hope that she will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-35_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   In a few moments I shall certainly withdraw the amendment. I shall read very carefully what the Minister said. I do not wish to waste the Committee's time but I do not see why two Acts are able to accommodate the provision that we are discussing while this Bill cannot. The mere fact that no one has asked about the matter does not mean that the measure is not necessary. I suggest that it is not unnecessary. If the relevant information is kept in the register, that is all right. It should not be too difficult to do that. However, having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40301-35_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 132CA I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 132CB to 132CF.

I am unsure&#151;I shall ask my noble friend to explain&#151;whether St Andrew is also involved in this matter. I speak only for St David although Scotland may also be involved.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para12"></a>I shall recite the meaning behind the amendments. This part of the Bill is concerned with general regulations amending the Electricity Act 1989. That <P>


<a name="column_GC180"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Act was passed before devolution, so Sections 36 and 37 and Schedule 8 to the Electricity Act 1989 have nothing to do with devolution. Part of my purpose is to ensure that the Bill becomes part of the devolutionary principle.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para13"></a>We are dealing with planning matters; we are not dealing with the production of energy. Perhaps I may take the Committee through the existing situation. If a generating station as defined in Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989&#151;this is not an issue of wind farms but of any generating station which makes an application&#151;has an installed capacity of over 50 megawatts, it goes through a certain procedure and if it is under 50 megawatts it goes through another procedure. Under Section 37 high voltage overhead lines go through a more or less similar procedure.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para14"></a>What are those procedures? In Schedule 8 the procedures are defined as follows: if the local planning authority objects to the planning application for a fossil fuel station, a nuclear power station, a wind farm or whatever, the Secretary of State is obliged to create a public inquiry. On the other hand, if the local authority says, "It is all very well, it seems a good idea to have a nuclear power station in Ceredigion", or wherever, as long as it is 50 megawatts plus it will not go to the National Assembly for Wales, but straight to the Secretary of State. The National Assembly for Wales has absolutely no locus in this matter at all. That was shown in one famous incident of a wind farm on the Cambrian Mountains, but I shall not go into that. That went straight to the Secretary of State, who said, "That is fine; the Ceredigion county council has said that it is okay by them". I have no particular brief against the Ceredigion county council, but I want to illustrate to the Committee what happens when Welsh county councils are, for one reason or another, decisive in their view that they want a particular piece of machinery on their hills.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para15"></a>When we come to a public inquiry, the Secretary of State appoints an inspector; the National Assembly for Wales, which has no locus whatever, has nothing to do with it. So Clause 150 in the Bill proposes that Schedule 8 to the Electricity Act 1989 be amended to allow the Secretary of State to appoint the lead inspector in matters concerning Wales. That does not apply to Scotland&#151;I hope that I shall receive some information on how it may or may not apply to Scotland&#151;but it applies to Wales.
<P>

<a name="40301-35_para16"></a>My amendments simply say that if there are to be public inquiries, the National Assembly for Wales should have a locus. I hope that the Committee and my noble friend will consider this issue sympathetically, not because I am speaking for St David&#151;although I am sure that if St David were here he would support me&#151;but because I believe that if the Government wish devolution, the Government must will the means for devolution. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-35_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I notice from the Explanatory Notes to the Bill that the reason why the clause does not apply to Scotland is that developments in this respect will be in the hands of Scottish Ministers. That is all right by St Andrew, I am sure. However, will the Minister tell the Grand Committee whether the amendment and the clause that we are discussing are affected by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill? I thought that I understood that changes were being made in it that affected this issue, but I may be wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I rise only to make one point. Of course, I agree with the point made by my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon. I should in addition like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, on having produced his amendment on St. David's Day. He is wearing a symbol of the day in his lapel. His ability to manage the proceedings of the Grand Committee staggers one's admiration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Several actors on the Grand Committee have been complicit in ensuring that this amendment appeared on St. David's day, for all sorts of reasons. In responding to my noble friend, I can tell him that he has quite a good case but he has brought it to the wrong Bill. That is what I am going to argue with him in a moment. He is well aware of the fact that great concern was expressed in Wales over the proposed development of the wind farm in the Cambrian mountains. It raised very significant issues, to which he referred. I am grateful that he referred to the issue en passant, including it as substance for his case, without going substantially into the issues, as I would have recognised the strength of the position that that illustrated.
<P>

<a name="40301-36_para0"></a>Suffice it to say that we regard the amendments as partial, in any case. They refer to additional inspectors, when what my noble friend is seeking is that the whole concept of who should appoint the lead inspector and additional inspectors and who should make the decision on the proposal should be shifted, in Wales, from the Secretary of State to the National Assembly.
<P>

<a name="40301-36_para1"></a>We have been active in the wake of concerns that have been reflected. There is a tripartite working group of officials from the Wales Office, the National Assembly and the DTI already under way to examine the issues of whether consenting powers on power stations, and possibly other aspects of energy infrastructure, should be transferred from central government to the devolved administration. That is the burden of the amendment. That work is ongoing <P>


<a name="column_GC182"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and will not report in the immediate future, but it will provide the base for potential legislative changes. But those changes would affect very significant statutory processes and transfer them to the National Assembly, if such a strategy were agreed on. My noble friend will appreciate that the vehicle for that transfer would probably be a transfer of functions order under the Government of Wales Act 1998 rather than this particular Bill. That work is being carried out against a background where the case which my noble friend put forward has significant substance and is strongly supported in Wales.
<P>

<a name="40301-36_para2"></a>I have no doubt that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, indicated, had her noble friend been present, we should have had the additional force of the argument being presented in lilting Welsh tones. It is a matter of great regret to us that he is not present today&#151;for reasons that we understand. I mention, en passant, that he was unable to be present during debate on another Wales Bill last week in which I participated. Therefore, it is not only on St David's Day that the interests of Wales are involved in our deliberations in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="40301-36_para3"></a>The Scots have not asked for this development, probably because Scottish planning legislation is vastly different from that of Wales. The Welsh legislation forms an integral part of the English and Welsh position. That is why the crucial question of the devolved administration and the position of the National Assembly comes into force in relation to Wales, but the same anxieties do not exist in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40301-36_para4"></a>I hope that my noble friend will recognise that the Government are not standing idly by against the background of the furore created last year with regard to Cefn Croes. There are other potential projects which affect Wales. But, in this respect, we are working towards the National Assembly as opposed to central government playing a proper role in this matter. However, this is not the Bill in which to provide for that and, in any event, as I believe my noble friend will recognise, the amendments fall considerably short of the necessary changes expected in legislation to achieve the objective that he seeks and for which I evince a degree of sympathy.

<A NAME="40301-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I would not particularly blame the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, or his noble friend if they felt that, instead of being frightfully active, the Government were moving rather slowly beside them. However, surely if the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, redrafted his amendments so that, in effect, they were amendments to the Electricity Act 1989, they would be valid here and entirely appropriate. It is not for me to tell him how to table his amendments, but I thought that that point should be made.

<A NAME="40301-36_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My noble friend has poached what I was intending to say.

<FONT SIZE=3>place. However, I believe that we have had enough of that. If we can address this issue in a more direct way, I believe that we should do so. Indeed, my noble friend put forward a very good suggestion in that respect. I do not consider that it is acceptable simply to deal with matters in an order when we have the opportunity to put the provision on to the face of the Bill. Therefore, I support the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am most grateful to my noble friend for expressing some sympathy with what I said. I agree that the amendments that I have tabled today do no more than simply trade an important issue. However, I do not believe that a tripartite group will produce anything in the immediate future. In fact, my noble friend used the words, "not in the immediate future ... probably a transfer of functions order".
<P>

<a name="40301-36_para5"></a>Nothing concentrates the Government's mind so much as an amendment on the face of the Bill. Therefore, I give my noble friend notice that, when we reach Report, I shall take further action to amend paragraph 2 of Schedule 8 to the Electricity Act 1989, which, instead of conferring powers on the Secretary of State, confers those powers, so far as concerns Wales, on the National Assembly for Wales. I hope very much, and am sure, that noble Lords opposite will support me. I also hope that the Government will understand that I am determined. For the first time since 1997, I propose to oppose the Government if my amendments are not accepted. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40301-36_para21"></a>There is an amazing congruence between those two pieces of legislation. They are both before the House at this time. It is not surprising that there is a congruence because this second Bill deals with planning and compulsory purchase powers. In that Bill Clause 44 deals with major infrastructure projects of national or regional significance, which would obviously include major power transmission lines and major generating stations.
<P>

<a name="40301-36_para22"></a>The fact is that we have two planning systems in this country: we have a planning system that deals with planning matters that are normally dealt with and the energy department has its own planning system which deals with energy planning matters. I tried to find out the background to this situation. We are concerned with amending the Electricity Act 1989, but I asked myself whether that was always the situation and I do not believe that it was. Going back to the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, which is mentioned in the Electricity Act 1989, I find that statutory undertakers are dealt with and that is a different world. I suspect that the roots of this matter go right back to the 1940s. Section 225 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-36_para23"></a><P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-36_para24"></a>
this is a planning Act and would concern a different Secretary of State from the Electricity Act&#151;
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-36_para27"></a><P>

<a name="40301-36_para28"></a>In Section 224 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, there is a definition of the appropriate Minister. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In this Act the 'appropriate Minister' . . . in relation to statutory undertakers carrying on an undertaking for the supply of electricity, gas or hydraulic power, means the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-36_para29"></a>
which is now the DTI. The significant part of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 is that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an application . . . or an appeal . . . shall be dealt with by the Secretary of State [dealing with planning] and the appropriate Minister".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-36_para30"></a>
So, in those days there was presumably joined-up government. The department took the planning lead&#151;responsible for planning&#151;and it was done in conjunction with the then appropriate government department.
<P>

<a name="40301-36_para31"></a>I went back to the Town and Country Planning Act 1962 to see whether I could get to the root of the matter, because that was the predecessor Act. I found more or less parallel wording. The fact of the matter is that we have a situation in which the government <P>


<a name="column_GC185"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>department responsible for studying and dealing with energy matters is also the planning department that has to grant the planning approval.
<P>

<a name="40301-36_para32"></a>I suggest that that is an ethical conflict of interest, which really should be dealt with. The Bill seeks to perpetuate the situation. I can understand that because it seems to me that it will be quite complicated to try to deal with it. I wonder whether we should take the opportunity, particularly now that the power industries are private industries, to put them on planning parity with everyone else, and to remove the planning powers of the DTI so that planning matters are dealt with under the legislation which is going through the House with precisely the same words in the planning and compulsory purchase powers.
<P>

<a name="40301-36_para33"></a>It was mere coincidence that I happened to read those two parts of these two separate pieces of legislation at almost the same time and I was alerted to this particular anomaly. It is an anomaly that could be dealt with at this stage. I thought that we should at the very least have a serious discussion to consider whether or not we should deal with it at this stage.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-37_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I strongly support the interest of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, in this subject. I am very grateful to him for raising an issue that otherwise might have been in danger of passing us by. I think it is a very important issue. The issue he raised about whether the department should be judge and jury in a case, of course, is particularly significant. Few applications&#151;even for wind turbines which I suggest are relatively benign, although I know that quite often the noble Lord takes a different view regarding land-based wind turbines&#151;provoke such strong feelings from the public as energy generation installations.
<P>

<a name="40301-37_para0"></a>I know that some Members of the Official Opposition have been questioning the Government on this issue&#151;the Government have not made a statement&#151;but if we were to envisage the building of new nuclear power stations, which we certainly do not support at this time, I would not want to see any planning system whereby the department was judge and jury. With that in mind, I think this is a very interesting question.
<P>

<a name="40301-37_para1"></a>The second reason why I support the noble Lord in raising this issue is that the planning system is already sufficiently opaque to the public. The system is not friendly to the public even in straightforward applications, even though local authorities may try to make it so. A planning application can be considered and determined by the local authority and then appealed, and it can then be sent to an inspector who makes a different decision which is called in by the Secretary of State. The public have to come to grips with the system, and they often know how it works.
<P>

<a name="40301-37_para2"></a>Part of that system will be changed by the Bill currently being considered by your Lordships' House. As the noble Lord has pointed out, there is a parallel system which could further confuse the issue. On an issue as contentious as power generation, I wonder <P>


<a name="column_GC186"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether the Government think it appropriate to have this parallel system. I must re-emphasise how grateful I am to the noble Lord for raising the issue.

<A NAME="40301-37_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I congratulate my noble friend for discovering this point and raising it today. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller&#151;who said she thought that she might have missed it&#151;that this Lady Miller most definitely would have missed it if it had not been raised by my noble friend. The Minister will undoubtedly have had the benefit of all the brains of the officials behind him who have been looking into the town and country planning legislation. No doubt he will present us with an answer today, but whether it will be the definitive answer that will make my noble friend happy is another matter. We shall listen with interest to his reply on this very interesting and important point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-37_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   When the Minister replies to this interesting debate, will he tell us whether he is absolutely convinced that, in this respect, he is right to certify that the Bill is in accordance with the convention on human rights? I seem to remember that one of the great upsets in the whole issue of human rights occurred in Guernsey, I think, on a planning issue; it concerned someone in Guernsey wearing several hats at once. It is difficult to see how a certificate can stand up for an area that does not want a development. In the circumstances proposed here, I begin to see why Scotland does not want to join this particular club. I do not think that it applies in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The noble Lord has raised some very interesting points. However, taken in parallel with the Bill presently being discussed in the Chamber, Clause 150 is intended to bring more into line the changes which we are introducing into planning generally with those in this Bill as regards energy projects. The noble Lord says that the clauses are effectively the same. The changes that we are introducing are creating a system that is more coherent and more streamlined in relation to major energy projects. The usual complaint about energy projects is that the planning system takes far too long and not that it excludes people. We are therefore seeking to streamline the system in parallel with other major projects being dealt with by the other Bill.
<P>

<a name="40301-37_para3"></a>The noble Lord raises the question of whether we could have two different systems of planning. In fact, it is not entirely confined to these two systems of planning; there are different systems of planning for different aspects of the projects. Most road and railway transport projects are dealt with somewhat differently from more general planning structures. Of course, there have been times when the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment have been the same department, and times when they have not.
<P>

<a name="40301-37_para4"></a>The research of the noble Lord is impressive, in going back to 1962, when probably the reference to a Minister meant something different than it would <P>


<a name="column_GC187"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>now, given the current structure of the departments. The noble Baroness is correct in saying that the archivists in the DTI have material on the matter that goes back for some time. The important role of central government with regard to energy has been recognised for a very long time. I am glad to short-circuit the weekend researches of the noble Lord, as they could have gone on for some considerable time. I am informed that that involvement in overhead lines has been going on since 1899, for example, and in power stations since 1909. I hope that I have saved him some work there.
<P>

<a name="40301-37_para5"></a>We have a separate system, which has recognised the importance of energy supply for that long. Since that early period, the industry has been municipalised, privatised, nationalised and re-privatised. I do not see that there is necessarily an argument for departing from the system at this point because we are now dealing with a privatised system. Nor do I believe that it is conclusive to say that there is a conflict of interest in relation to the DTI's role, because the issue is dealt with in the same way as it was for transport projects under part of the DETR. We had to ring-fence the planning dimension, and the same applies to the DTI in energy matters.
<P>

<a name="40301-37_para6"></a>Here I can refer, legally speaking, to the judgment in the Alconbury case, when transport and environment were under the same ministry. In that case, the House of Lords delivered a judgment in May 2001 that there was nothing wrong with the Secretary of State in that situation being both policy-maker and decision taker. It is not necessary to go into all the details of the case, but that was more or less a parallel system to the one that applies now. In that sense, the compatibility of the legislation with the European Convention on Human Rights does not really apply.
<P>

<a name="40301-37_para7"></a>As for Scotland and the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, the situation in terms of special planning regimes for utilities is no different. The role of central government is performed by Scottish Ministers supported by the Scottish executive. That is referred to in Sections 36 and 37. There has not been any change in devolution in that respect; the latest change applies in England and Wales, but the basic system is similar in Scotland. That is not always a conclusive argument for retaining it in England and Wales, but I am not convinced by the tidy-minded solution suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, who wants to bring all planning systems into a single structure. In any case, on the clause that we are debating, we are, if anything, moving in his direction by moving towards the same terms and towards precisely the same form of legislation for both a general planning structure and this structure in relation to major projects.
<P>

<a name="40301-37_para8"></a>I am not convinced by the arguments made by the noble Lord, but I hope that he will be convinced by mine. Whether the broader arguments are returned to in a separate context, the clause should nevertheless stand part.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-37_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Before the noble Lord replies, I have a question for the Minister. <P>


<a name="column_GC188"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Is his parallel with major road projects a reasonable one? Major road projects are obviously public projects to be used by the public. Generating plants, as envisaged under this clause, will be developed by the private sector. Therefore, I cannot really see that the parallel is fair.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-37_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   There are two aspects to the matter. One is that the product of the energy will be used by the public in the same way that the energy is used by the public and in the same way that publicly provided roads are used by the public. Of course, we also have privately provided roads, such as the north Birmingham relief road, which are subject to the same planning procedures. However, I am addressing whether the DTI can be judge and jury in the case that we are discussing. That has been considered a problem in relation to transport provision, but in the Alconbury case your Lordships' Judicial Committee found that there was no fundamental objection to such a provision. I argue that the same applies in relation to DTI and energy projects.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-37_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My noble friend Lady Carnegy raised the question of whether or not the measure was compatible with the convention. I heard the Minister say that he believed that it was compatible with the convention. I wish to raise one small point in that regard. The Minister said that, once the Motion was tabled that Clause 150 should not stand part of the Bill, undoubtedly officials were busy consulting former Acts and so on. When considering whether the Bill was compatible with the convention, was consideration given to whether a body should be judge and jury in a case? I do not assume that one would even have thought of that when asked to consider whether the measure was compatible with the convention. My noble friend Lady Carnegy made a valuable point in that regard.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I was speaking from a background of having been at a meeting last week in rural Perthshire at which enormous anxiety was expressed about a very large new transmission line for which planning permission is being sought. There is great public reaction against it, and particularly against the other subsidiary lines that would have to be installed for something like 500 windmills right down the backbone of rural Scotland. It seems to me that, when something such as this occurs, it is terribly important that the process should be seen to be absolutely fair to people. It should not look like dictatorship in any way at all. That was what was worrying me&#151;public reaction. One uses the argument about the Court of Human Rights but I did not know about the case that the noble Lord mentioned, which is probably relevant. Public relations are important with regard to this whole issue. We all know that energy has to be provided. The public know that. However, it is one's own backyard that is then damaged.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The question of compatibility with the convention is focused on what a Bill changes. What this Bill and the Bill currently under consideration in the Chamber change are some of the procedures for <P>


<a name="column_GC189"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>major projects under the relevant planning systems. The question of whether there is sufficient time and scope to object to and present cases through the planning system as envisaged by these new provisions has been judged on all legal advice to be compatible with the convention. Had the Alconbury case, to which I referred, gone the other way, it would have given us cause to raise the issue of the compatibility of the judge and jury issue that applies to existing legislation. However, it did not go the other way. Therefore, that issue was not addressed as noble Lords in their judicial capacity provided a judgment on it.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-38_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   Will the Minister consider another example of why streamlining might produce a difficulty? Streamlining is often a suspicious word, I think&#151;it means that things will be speeded up, often to the detriment of the public. It may be that inquiries have taken too long in the past but if they are streamlined to the point that they stop the public taking a full part, that is undesirable.
<P>

<a name="40301-38_para0"></a>The Government propose having several inspectors dealing with issues concurrently. Where a community chose to employ a lawyer to argue its case in front of an inspector or an expert&#151;whether or not it was a lawyer&#151;it would then have to have several people arguing the case concurrently in front of these inspectors, and that might cause a difficulty. At least in a planning inquiry where there is one inspector, one expert can be employed; it tends to be expensive for communities to employ such people. Have the Government considered that community representation will be somewhat undermined by this proposal?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   For major inquiries, even under the previous system, there is usually a pre-inquiry at which all the significant parties talk to the inspector and decide on the way in which the procedure will operate, marshalling evidence on how that is to be conducted for the convenience of everybody.
<P>

<a name="40301-38_para1"></a>I should have thought that if a single entity could have a number of parallel things going on at the same time, some of which were of interest and some of which were not, it would be likely to prove less expensive and time-consuming than a system which was effectively sequential, with everything taking place with the same inspector at the same time. If I was an objector to a major energy&#151;

<A NAME="40301-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   I was about to conclude my remarks in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. I felt that, for a community interest, it is probably more beneficial to conduct certain aspects of the system in parallel, rather than wait for a long inquiry which, like the Sizewell B inquiry, can last several years, through all of which a lawyer has to be retained. I therefore do not think there is any disadvantage in this respect to community <P>


<a name="column_GC190"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>groups and those with limited resources. I think that it will speed up the process while not diminishing the degree of engagement by all those with an interest who are rightly provided for in the planning process.

<A NAME="40301-38_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am particularly grateful to the noble Baronesses, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer and Lady Carnegy, and to my own leading Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, for coming in and supporting me on this point. I am very grateful to the Minister for his reply. I think that it has been worth having the discussion.
<P>

<a name="40301-38_para3"></a>I said that this was a probing debate. I entirely accept that simply saying that the clause should not stand part of the Bill would not have met the case I sought to argue. Now that I know that the issue goes back to 1899 in respect of power lines and to 1909 in respect of power stations, I am not surprised that I had some difficulty in trying to find my way through the legislative jungle. However, the fact that the history of this goes back that far is not a reason for not changing it. When one looks at the changes that have had to be made in business procedures and practices and across the whole spectrum of commercial life to try to make the system more ethical and more understandable so that it works properly in the interests of the community and shareholders and so on, it becomes apparent that this is a quite small issue. I have to accept that if there was a judgment on the Alconbury case that specifically recognised that it was not inappropriate for a government department to be both promoter and judge in a case, it rather weakens my argument. However, even that is not necessarily a reason why we should not change.
<P>

<a name="40301-38_para4"></a>I return to one point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. She was concerned about complications and inquiries becoming multiple inquiries and therefore perhaps causing representational problems for some members of the public or public groups. There are two sides to that equation. I believe that the Terminal 5 inquiry at Heathrow and even the Sizewell inquiry suffered from the same problem. Ultimately, what happened&#151;certainly with regard to Terminal 5&#151;was that some local authorities which were making representations ran out of funds because of the length of the inquiry. There is an urgent need to speed up the whole inquiry process. I completely support the Government in that.
<P>

<a name="40301-38_para5"></a>However, my amendment would not have attacked that issue. I was not seeking to amend the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has pointed out contains these accelerated procedures. The two Bills, as I illustrated, are running in precise parallel and therefore the accelerated procedures would still be there. But my view is that it would be ethically more straightforward if a Minister did not have to listen to all the representations that might give rise to the need for power stations. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, was right to mention what might have to happen in the nuclear field and how highly controversial that would be if and when it happened.

<a name="40301-38_para6"></a>The Minister in this one department will have the job, first, of sorting out the policy. He will then have to sort out the specific action. Then he will have to hold the inquiry because you can bet your bottom dollar that there will be one. The same man will have to pass judgment on the results of the inquiry and he will have to judge it against the question of national necessity. I feel sorry for the man who bears all those burdens. That is all I can say.

<a name="40301-38_para7"></a>I shall want to study a little more carefully precisely what the Minister said. I shall probably want to consider the Alconbury judgment, too, but for now I beg leave to withdraw my opposition to the clause standing part of the Bill.

 "ASSISTANCE FOR AREAS WITH HIGH DISTRIBUTION COSTS
<br>
(1) If it appears to the Secretary of State&#151;
<br>
(a) that the costs of distributing electricity within a particular area of Great Britain are significantly higher (when calculated on a per customer basis) than in other areas of Great Britain, and
<br>
(b) that within that area there are at least 100,000 premises that are connected to the same distribution system,
<br>
he may make an order under this section.
<br>
(2) An order under this section is one that establishes a scheme which&#151;
<br>
(a) requires authorised transmitters to make a payment each year to authorised distributors distributing electricity in that area of Great Britain of such amount as may be determined in accordance with provision contained in the scheme; and
<br>
(b) requires the charges imposed by the authorised transmitters on authorised suppliers to be adjusted in accordance with the scheme for the purpose of enabling the transmitters to make that payment.
<br>
(3) An order under this section establishing a scheme in relation to the distribution of electricity within a particular area must specify the area.
<br>
(4) For the purpose of facilitating the implementation of a scheme for which an order under this section provides, such an order may make such modifications as the Secretary of State considers appropriate of the conditions of the licences of authorised suppliers, of authorised transmitters and of authorised distributors.
<br>
(5) For the purpose of carrying out the functions conferred on him by or under this section the Secretary of State may require&#151;
<br>
(a) an authorised supplier,
<br>
(b) an authorised distributor, or
<br>
(c) an authorised transmitter,
<br>
to supply him, in a specified form and within a specified time, with information of a specified description.
<br>
(6) Before making an order under this section, the Secretary of State must consult such persons as he considers appropriate.
<br>
(7) Subsection (6) may be satisfied by consultation that took place wholly or partly before the commencement of this section.
<br>
(8) An order under this section is subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<br>
(9) Where a scheme established under this section in relation to the distribution of electricity within a particular area is in force, no scheme shall be established under this section in relation to the distribution of electricity outside that area.

(10) Where a scheme is established under this section, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to carry out a review of that scheme&#151;
<br>
(a) three years after its establishment; and
<br>
(b) thereafter at three yearly intervals.
<br>
(11) In section 25(8) of the 1989 Act (definitions relating to the provisions of that Act concerned with compliance orders), in the definition of "relevant requirement" at the end insert "or section (Assistance for areas with high distribution costs)(5) of the Energy Act 2004".
<br>
(12) In this section&#151;
<br>
"authorised distributor" and "authorised supplier" have the same meanings as in Part 1 of the 1989 Act;
<br>
"authorised transmitter" means a person authorised by a licence under section 6(1)(b) of that Act to participate in the transmission of electricity;
<br>
"distributing", "distribution" and "distribution system" have the same meanings as in Part 1 of that Act;

"premises" has the same meaning as in Part 1 of that Act."

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40301-38_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of Amendment No. 132D is to replace a licence condition known as "hydro benefit" in Scotland. This licence condition requires Scottish and Southern Energy's generation business to pay a sum of money to its distribution business in recognition of the fact that the cost of providing power to customers in the north of Scotland is considerably higher than elsewhere because of the terrain and remoteness.
<P>

<a name="40301-38_para11"></a>The hydro benefit licence condition needs to be replaced because Ofgem has received clear legal advice that it may be discriminatory under EC law&#151;primarily because the burden falls on one company. It has therefore removed it from the licence given to Scottish and Southern Energy. SSE, however, has pledged to maintain the effects of the licence condition until the provisions of BETTA go live. Those have now been formalised in the price control mechanism. Unlike hydro benefit, the financial assistance proposed under that provision will not be recovered solely from a single company but from all suppliers. All suppliers will therefore be treated in the same way, and will all fund the payment via the transmission charges that they pay to the GB system operator.
<P>

<a name="40301-38_para12"></a>The amendment will have the same effect as the hydro benefit provisions, in that it will prevent consumers' bills in the north of Scotland incurring significant price rises that would otherwise result from the removal of the provisions. Initial analysis suggests that a medium-sized standard credit consumer's bill might increase by 10 per cent in the absence of hydro benefit, and the replacement would therefore also avoid an increase not only in bills but also in fuel poverty in the north of Scotland, where there is a very high proportion of households in fuel poverty. It is our intention to maintain the current level of hydro benefit, which was set at £39 million per annum last year. We shall consult on the order to give effect to that for the next six months, and it will therefore be in time for inclusion in the BETTA provisions.

<a name="40301-38_para13"></a>Finally, we are aware that for ease of reference it would be more appropriate to lay the provision as an amendment to the Electricity Act 1989 as opposed to a freestanding clause within the Energy Bill. We are also now aware that there should be a specific provision that would make it clear that the Secretary of State is not entitled to require the production of any document that a court could not require. That means that an amendment will be needed to bring the legislation into line with other information provisions in the 1989 Act. We shall have to come back to tidy that last element at Report stage. However, the main provision in this amendment will ensure that consumers in the north of Scotland do not miss out and that the burden is effectively borne by the system. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40301-39_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I thank the Minister for his clear explanation of the amendment. It was a little surprising that it took so long to appear, but that is not meant as a criticism because the Minister did announce that he would introduce an amendment with the effect of this amendment.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para0"></a>There is no point in repeating what the Minister said, because we all understand the points that he made. The whole hydro benefit system was introduced by a Conservative government in 1957, and created in recognition of the higher distribution costs in remote highlands and islands. However, I have one question for the Minister. The amendment seems to be an attempt to replicate the social responsibilities of the Hydro-Electric Board&#151;which is now called Scottish and Southern Energy. Will the Scottish Office&#151;that is to say the taxpayer&#151;pick up the bill now that the cross-subsidy has been forbidden? I am not quite sure whether the Minister said that now the system would pay or that all the people would contribute. I would be most interested if he could clarify that matter.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para1"></a>To the extent that the amendment restores the position that the Conservatives created 47 years ago, we certainly do not oppose it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin: </B>   I welcome the amendment. It is very important for those who live in the north of Scotland, and very important for the future of developing industries in the north of Scotland. The old north of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board had built-in provision in social clauses. Those all went when denationalisation came in, and I am not suggesting for one moment that they should have been reinstated. However, in this amendment I believe that the Government are realising the difficulties which exist in distant, remote areas. For 13 years I had the honour of representing the constituency of Ross and Cromarty, as it was then. Parts of that constituency were very remote, and the thought of having to provide a power supply to some of those places was horrific. Had provision not existed at that time for assistance to be given, many places there would not have had power.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para2"></a>Therefore, I am very grateful to the Government for what they are doing in the Bill to ensure that the additional costs which occur in areas such as the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Highlands of Scotland are appreciated and that the benefits will accrue accordingly. I thank the Government very much. I have never been slow to criticise them with regard to certain issues in the Bill and I have no doubt that I shall wish to criticise them about many more, but I appreciate what they have done in this instance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-39_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I welcome this government amendment. If noble Lords are worried that the Government are being too friendly to northern Scotland, they can observe on page 7 of the Marshalled List that, under proposed subsection (10) of the new clause, the matter will be reviewed after three years and every three years thereafter so that, should circumstances change, it need not be a permanent arrangement.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para3"></a>I believe I am right in saying that, at present, in the north of Scotland electricity is very expensive, even now, compared with most places. I know that my bill is absolutely terrifying. If the noble Lord had been in Scotland over the past week and had experienced the low temperatures, he would realise that that accounts for quite a lot of one's bill. Therefore, the amendment is helpful.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para4"></a>I am glad that my noble friend pointed out that these are not social clauses. The arrangement comes within our present system and it is being continued in this way. We are very grateful to the Government for taking the trouble to introduce it in such a way that it will not be objected to by the European Commission.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-39_spnew3"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   I do not want to delay the Committee but I have one question. Ofgem announced last month that it intended to end the hydro-benefit subsidy system in Scotland after it received legal advice that hydro benefit was probably discriminatory and contrary to EU law. I went back to Scottish and Southern Energy and asked whether it could tell me under which EU law it was found to be discriminatory. SSE was not terribly helpful. It said that it thought it might be something to do with the position on renewables, but I said that that seemed quite impossible. How would the Government manage to overcome the idea that it was probably discriminatory?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I hesitate to intervene as a Sassenach in this debate, particularly as, when I finish, I suspect that I may have some Scots in kilts harrying me down the streets of London. However, I believe it is important to point out that the costs of the generating distribution industry are finite. The charges to the customers must meet those costs and earn a profit. Therefore, if we are to give some people a lower share of the real cost, someone else must pay the extra cost because it must be met. That is where I am in danger of offending the Scots.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para5"></a>If the Minister tells me that the intention is to use the orders where appropriate to try to ensure that, as near as possible, the consumers all ultimately pay more or less the same price, that is one thing. I believe that that is probably the intention behind the scheme. But if he does not tell me that that is the intention, there may be <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-39_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Until the noble Lord's intervention, I was basking in the praise and gratitude of our Scottish colleagues. But of course there is an implication for consumers in Essex, as the noble Lord knows.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para6"></a>The answer to the noble Baroness's question is that rather than one supplying company bearing the cost, all supplying companies will bear the cost. Presumably, all or most supplying companies will try and pass on as much of their costs to their ultimate consumers as they can. If it is all passed on, the increase in bills would be roughly 0.3 per cent if it were spread evenly, a small part of the total bill.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para7"></a>To that extent, consumers elsewhere are supporting consumers in the north of Scotland, whose prices would otherwise be significantly higher. They are already high in most cases, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, says, and they would be higher were this benefit to be removed. The nationalised north of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board had the hydro benefit as part of its provisions. This was a replacement for that measure on privatisation as a licensing condition, because it could be held to discriminate against one company. That is the EU law point&#151;once it is spread around all companies, there is no problem because we are not being discriminatory.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para8"></a>While always bearing in mind the point of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, I will sit down with the support of our Scottish colleagues and say that we are trying to maintain a position which the system had, in different ways, managed to deliver to consumers in the north of Scotland for the past 45 years. We have found a way round this which I think will be beneficial and will not be at too great a cost to everybody else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-39_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, let me say that I entirely agree with what he says. However, he has not said that the intention behind this is, within reason, to try and equalise the costs at the point of the consumer. Is that the intention?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-39_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   The point of competition policy and regulation is not entirely to equalise cost; it is, however, to provide the most cost-effective means by which to benefit the consumer. The cost to Scottish consumers is, and is likely to remain, higher than average, even after this measure is applied. That has always been the case, but the higher cost is partly offset.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-39_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Thank you.

<A NAME="40301-39_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 133:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 116, line 22, after first "the" insert "Secretary of State or"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40301-39_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40301-39_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: This group of amendments seeks to probe the Government on their intention with regard to the surpluses that are built up from the auctioning of income that the non-fossil purchasing agency carries out. Clause 141 contains some suggestions about what will happen in Scotland, leaving the rest of the UK in a very different position.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para13"></a>Let me give noble Lords the background. When the Utilities Act 2000 was introduced, changes had to be made to the contracts which are let under the non-fossil fuel obligation. The new arrangements for the NFFO contracts in England and Wales provide that, first, the non-fossil purchasing agency pays generators the contract price for each kilowatt of power generated and, secondly, the non-fossil purchasing agency auctions the output of those contracts.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para14"></a>At the moment, the NFPA receives more income from the auctions than it needs to pay generators and so a surplus of money is building up. A similar situation arises in Scotland with the Scottish renewables order contract in that a surplus pot of money is building up, although I understand that the details of the auction arrangements are slightly different.
<P>

<a name="40301-39_para15"></a>As I understand it, Clause 151 enables Scotland to act in a more desirable way than the rest of the UK. The difficulty with regard to the surplus that is building up in the rest of the UK is that no provision is made for it, save for that first £60 million. The first £60 million of the pot was covered by the Sustainable Energy Act 2003 which specified that that £60 million had to be spent on renewable energy projects. However, unless the Minister tells me differently, I understand that that is less than one year's worth of the build-up of such surpluses so the surplus will continue to build and the Energy Bill, as presently drafted, does not provide for the same purpose as it does in Scotland. In other words, that surplus should go into renewable energy projects. Perhaps the Minister would intimate whether my interpretation of the Bill is incorrect. However, if it is correct, I wonder why Scotland has the benefit of the surplus being spent on renewable energy projects and England does not. I beg to move.

I find the argument advanced by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, very intriguing. I certainly had not spotted that there is a difference between Scotland and England. I shall be interested to hear the response to that.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para0"></a>I am sure that Ministers will recognise that there is a hole in the buy-out fund as a result of TXU and another company going into administration&#151;it was some £23 million short. Due to the fossil fuel levy, a sum is building up and it was suggested that it should <P>


<a name="column_GC197"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be used for renewable energy. There you have a system that requires the money to be used for renewable energy. Why can that fossil fuel money not be used to fill the hole in the buy-out fund? When the issue first arose, we were told that that could not possibly be done. My question is why not? It seems that there is a perfectly valid use for it. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, said, it does not appear that it is being put to any other use. In a sense it is a hangover from the earlier system, before we moved to the present system and the renewables obligation. It was intended to encourage renewable energy. That was the proposal of the previous government and it was effective so far as it went. Why can it not be used for the hole in the buy-out fund?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-40_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, for tabling the amendment about the use of sums raised by the fossil fuel levy. As far as I can, I shall try to answer other questions that have arisen, including the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin's, question. I was trying not to make a mistake in saying that, but there is an apostrophe S. It is a silent apostrophe, but there are now best-selling books written on such matters.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para1"></a>We appreciate what lies behind the amendment&#151;it is a wish to promote renewable energy. We share that desire. However, we have already demonstrated that through our renewable energy policies and programmes and will continue to do so. We have only very recently legislated, through the Sustainable Energy Act, on the use of £60 million of the (England and Wales) fossil fuel levy surplus. Spending decisions will be decided in the 2004 spending review. The £60 million mainly for capital grants is intended to help drive forward renewables deployment and will be allocated over the next two financial years.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para2"></a>Some of the funding will be used to support offshore wind developments. As we have tried to persuade noble Lords during previous discussion on the Bill, these have an extremely important role to play in working towards the achievement of the 10 per cent renewables electricity target by 2010 so we shall be getting real added value for renewables from this funding.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para3"></a>I should like, if I may, to take a few moments to explain the Government's position more broadly. Clause 151 as proposed in the Government's Energy Bill allows Scottish Ministers to direct Ofgem to pay surplus Scottish fossil fuel levy moneys into the Scottish consolidated fund and to make provision in budget proposals to the Scottish Parliament that these sums are used to promote the use of renewable energy in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para4"></a>Similar powers were obtained by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in respect of the fossil fuel levy fund in England and Wales through recent legislation&#151;the Sustainable Energy Act 2003. However, the provisions in the Sustainable Energy Act cover only £60 million rather than all the funds. That, of course, is at the heart of the noble Baroness's <P>


<a name="column_GC198"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC198</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment. The amendment proposed by the noble Baroness would extend the provisions of Clause 151 to cover the total amount that might arise in both funds.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para5"></a>The Scottish fossil fuel levy fund is based on a smaller number of contracts and is, in turn, of lower value overall than the England and Wales fund. The Scottish fund currently stands at just £3.8 million. I repeat the figures because the contrasts of magnitude are very significant for the purpose of the argument. I refer to £60 million in one case and £3.8 million in the other. It clearly would not make sense for there to be a limit on the amounts&#151;£3.8 million being a relatively small sum in these circumstances&#151;that Scottish Ministers could direct to be used for renewables. I was asked why should there be a difference between Scotland and England and Wales in that regard. The answer concerns the sheer magnitude of the sums involved. Sub-division of the smaller sum would scarcely be likely to be effective.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para6"></a>The England and Wales fund stands at around £112 million and there is now a £60 million limit on amounts that the Secretary of State can direct for use on renewables. I should like to point out that no decisions have been taken on the use of the remainder of the existing sums in the England and Wales levy fund apart from the need to keep a £30 million reserve. That is the only decision about the remaining balance that has been taken. There will be further additions to the fund from the future auction of NFFO ROCs. I understand that that is pronounced "noffo rocks". When I first read the term, I thought that it must be a heavy metal rock band, but it turns out to be much more benign than that. As I say, further additions to the fund from the future auction of NFFO ROCs are expected and consideration will be given to the use of future sums in the fossil fuel levy fund in due course.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para7"></a>I hope I have demonstrated that we are putting the £60 million from the fossil fuel levy surplus for England and Wales to good use. However, while we understand completely the sentiment behind the proposition that has been made, we cannot accept the amendment in this form.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, also asked why we should not use the Sustainable Energy Act to bail out the buy-out fund, as it would restore confidence and thus restore the ROC price to former levels. Any such loan would soon be repaid in terms of higher ROC prices. As I think was said before, the Government do not have any plans to make good the shortfall since the renewables obligation is a market-driven mechanism. Government intervention in this way would inevitably intervene in the free market in ROCs, which might well have an adverse impact on confidence in the longer term.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para9"></a>There would also be issues concerning the precedent. In any event, our legal advice is that the provisions of the Sustainable Energy Act do not permit us to use it in this way. That may or may not be an answer from which noble Lords will take great comfort, but that is the answer. In the light of all the elements of my answer, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-40_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   Before the noble Baroness does that, perhaps the Minister could answer a couple of questions. He said quite clearly that at the moment there is £60 million to be spent on renewable obligations but that the fund&#151;if I am following the argument correctly, and I hope I am&#151;currently stands at £112 million. Of that figure the Government have decided to put £30 million into reserve, which in my quick maths leaves £22 million spare before we have any money coming in from the option. I hope that my figures are followed through.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para10"></a>The Minister said that some of this money would go towards helping the offshore wind farm development. How much of that £60 million is it anticipated will go for that? Where or what other sources will go towards that? He said quite clearly that it was for a capital grant over the next two years. One complaint I have had about this Bill all the way through is that it does not deal with energy per se, it deals with a very limited aspect of energy, and particularly it deals with regard to offshore wind farms on the renewables side. There are many other worthy examples and businesses trying to set themselves up to use waste products from which to extract renewable energy.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para11"></a>We have talked before in Committee about the question of using tidal power. Perhaps this money can be used in a slightly more creative way to look at forms of renewables other than offshore wind farms. It would be a pity if it could not be used in that way. Wind farms are hugely costly as well. So I realise that the £60 million will soon get eaten up. But it would help, certainly from my point of view&#151;I do not know about the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer&#151;if we could have a little more clarity on where the money is going. Is it just in an overall general pot? It would be an opportunity missed if we could not use it in a slightly broader way. Having read this particular part of the Bill, I did not see it clearly identified.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-40_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I listened very carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, said. In fact he answered a different question from the one that I asked. He answered the question by saying why should not part of the £60 million that had gone into the Sustainable Energy Act be used for the hole in the buy-out fund. I understand his answer, but that was not what I asked. I asked why should not any of the surplus from the fossil fuel levy be used for this purpose temporarily&#151;as he suggested&#151;as a loan which would then be repaid. Working out the sums in my head, no doubt inaccurately, of the £112 million, he is putting £30 million to reserve. That takes one down to £82 million. He has £60 million for the Sustainable Energy Act. He is therefore left with £22 million. Does the Committee know what the sum of the hole in the buy-out fund is? It is just over £22 million, so he has the money to do it without drawing on any of the £60 million at all.
<P>

<a name="40301-40_para12"></a>As the Minister rightly said, the failure to pay on the part of one of the large contributors has undermined confidence in the renewables obligation certificates. As that has resulted in a fall in the value of the RO <P>


<a name="column_GC200"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC200</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>certificates and a diminution of the incentive that the system is intended to offer&#151;to produce more renewable energy&#151;I should have thought that there was more to be said for the proposition of using the money to make a loan to help the fund out than the Minister perhaps allowed. Perhaps we might reflect on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-41_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   While the Minister is composing his reply and doing the maths, it would help me to decide on the tone of my withdrawal of my amendment if he would say what he meant by the phrase that the Government could not accept the amendment in this form. Does he mean that if the amendment was in another form, it would be acceptable, or did he mean that the amendment would be unacceptable in any form?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   Let me start by telling noble Lords that all of them have done the maths right and that it would have been perfect arithmetic if I had read them the right figure. I apologise&#151;what can I say? I misread it, and when I tell noble Lords the right figure they will feel that their arguments are all the stronger rather than weaker. It was not £112 million but £122 million, so there was an extra £10 million that noble Lords could have pleaded in aid. I thought that I had better make a clean breast of that immediately.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para0"></a>I shall deal with the issues, even with the addition of the £10 million, which noble Lords will be delighted that I have discovered in addition to the sums that they worked out. First, it might be possible to discover what proportion of the £60 million has gone in capital grants, where it is intended to go. I was going to say that noble Lords will understand that I do not have the exact figures in front of me, but I am now briefed that, roughly speaking, half of that £60 million will be used on offshore wind capital projects. That is at least the beginning of an indicative figure. It may be that a more precise figure is available, but that is roughly half of it. I cannot tell noble Lords at this moment how the remaining half, approximately, will be deployed, but it is all in the service of renewables, which was the explicit intention of the provision. The allocation of much of the rest will be decided in the coming months; those decisions are not far away.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para1"></a>Secondly, I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that my point was not that the money that might be used to repair the hole in the buy-out fund should come from the £60 million, and I apologise if I spoke with insufficient accuracy. I had not intended to suggest that. I was referring to the more complete sum overall. The burden of my argument was that none the less, in a market-driven mechanism, any intervention by the state in the replacement of sums inevitably has some impact on the operation of such a market. Some might very well argue that the impact could be to restore confidence, while others might argue that one could never work out the proper way in which to fix the prices that would operate in circumstances in which trading was taking place normally and without that intervention. The case that the Government are putting forward in Grand Committee today is the latter of those cases&#151;that it would be a distortion. In <P>


<a name="column_GC201"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column GC201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any case, I hope that I have clarified that the money would come not from the £60 million but from the remaining sum.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para2"></a>I understand the argument that it is important to know how the sums would be spent overall. None the less, I do not think that it would be possible to go further than to repeat the point that £30 million will be held as a reserve and that decisions on the rest have not yet been taken.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para3"></a>I did not want to give the impression that an amendment in a different form would find its way into the Bill at Report. My point was that there is a huge amount of sympathy with the concept of trying to utilise funds to make sure that the renewables commitment is most effectively deployed. But at this stage, the expenditure of more than the sums I have referred to is not contemplated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-41_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   I thank the Minister for trying to break down my question on where the money was going. However, I want to press him further; if he is not able to answer me this afternoon, I am quite happy about that.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para4"></a>There is £30 million left that can be made available towards renewable projects. My question is twofold: is that knowledge in the public domain and, if it is, can individual companies make an approach? If so, who do they approach and how do they go about it? Or do the Government want to keep the money as a reserve, to be used at some time in the future? There are quite a few companies which are trying to convert chicken waste into heat, for example, and many other projects are being carried out. This is a question of waste that could be used to be of benefit in the broader sense. Such projects often struggle because of not having enough funding to make them financially viable, and if there are moneys available elsewhere, that knowledge should be in the common domain. I wonder whether it is.

<A NAME="40301-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   All I can say at this stage is that I have provided the figures and they are now a matter of record, so in that sense they are in the public domain.

<a name="40301-41_para5"></a>I have also said that at this point, there is no decision on the use of the remaining sums. I cannot really speculate about what anybody in the industry might do on having had the sums set out this afternoon. All I can say is that, at present, decisions have not been taken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-41_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, and the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, who have spoken in this debate. I thank the Minister for his reply, although naturally I am disappointed at his explanation that the Government could not accept the amendment in this form and for expressing the view that they were unlikely to accept it in any form.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para6"></a>As we interpret the Minister's words, anything above £60 million will probably simply be reabsorbed by the Treasury. Given the Government's other stated priority of hitting the Kyoto targets, it is a great shame when they know that renewable energy projects will have to be front-loaded in terms of funding; while they are at the development stage, such projects need more money. Some mechanism&#151;and I accept that my amendment may not provide the right one&#151;that frees up the surpluses that develop is extremely important.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para7"></a>So although I accept that the Scottish situation is very different for the reasons which the Minister outlined, I will want to return to the issue on Report to explore the extent of the shortfall in applications for renewable energy projects. I shall research the issue in the mean time, to see whether the targets which the Government have met could be better met if the funding were more generous. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-41_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </B>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para11"></a>On Friday 20 February the Police Service of Northern Ireland made a number of arrests in connection with an alleged assault and abduction. The case is sub judice.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para12"></a>Four people now face serious charges, including grievous bodily harm, possession of articles likely to be of use to terrorists and unlawful imprisonment. The PSNI are following a number of very definite evidential lines, including video material and the items, clothing and other forensic material recovered at the scene. The Chief Constable of the PSNI has made clear to me that he is satisfied that there was Provisional IRA involvement in the incident.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para13"></a>These events are a matter of serious concern. As far as the overall situation is concerned, my assessment of the various paramilitary organisations' ceasefires, in the light of information I have received, remains unchanged. But all the indications are that there has been a serious breach of the requirement set out by the British and Irish Governments in paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration for an end to all forms of paramilitary activity.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para14"></a>Such behaviour is wholly unacceptable. As the Government have repeatedly made clear, parties cannot be half-in, half-out of the democratic process. All paramilitary activity must stop.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para15"></a>These developments have inevitably had a serious impact on this week's discussions with the Northern Ireland political parties within the review of the operation of the Belfast agreement. At those meetings, we listened carefully to the views of the parties and, in particular, to their concerns about the implications of these events for the establishment of the trust and confidence required to achieve a successful outcome to the review and to restore devolved government in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para16"></a>Both Governments are now asking the Independent Monitoring Commission, which was established in January, to examine Friday's incident in the context of the preparation of its first report on paramilitary activity. We have also asked the commission to bring that report forward from July to May. The report is expected to take account of all paramilitary incidents and activities within its remit since the commission's establishment. The commission is obliged by law not to do anything in carrying out its functions that might have a prejudicial effect on any legal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40301-41_para17"></a>Both the British and Irish Governments are very clear that the achievement of a sustainable basis for <P>


<a name="column_WS42"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column WS42</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>political progress in Northern Ireland requires a full and permanent cessation of all paramilitary activity. As part of the wider agenda of the review, it is vital that we intensify engagement with the parties on this core issue, and we envisage that next week there will be a significant focus on it.

<P>

<a name="40301-42_para0"></a>A review of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 and the accompanying codes of practice is being undertaken by officials in the Northern Ireland Office.
<P>

<a name="40301-42_para1"></a>The review, which aims to bring the existing PACE legislation and the codes of practice in Northern Ireland into line with that in England and Wales, will adopt much of the new or amended legislation and revisions to the codes of practice introduced by the Home Office as a result of their fundamental review of PACE in 2002.
<P>

<a name="40301-42_para2"></a>It is my intention to issue a draft Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order and associated codes of practice for consultation in autumn 2004 with the aim of them becoming operational by summer 2005.

<A NAME="40301-42_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.
<P>

<a name="40301-42_para4"></a>Afghanistan remains a high priority for the Government. A lot has been achieved during the past two years. Around 3 million refugees have been helped to return to Afghanistan. Improvements have been made in education, with more than 4 million children back at school. Thirty seven per cent of pupils are now girls, up from 5 per cent in 2001. Twelve million children have been immunized against polio and 16 million against measles since 2002, saving 30,000 lives. Women are increasingly taking part in politics and the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>new constitution guarantees women 25 per cent of seats at the new parliament and equal rights and duties before the law. But there are still challenges ahead.
<P>

<a name="40301-42_para5"></a>As part of the UK's continuing commitment to Afghanistan I will be announcing, at the donor conference taking place in Berlin on 31 March and 1 April an increase in our assistance to at least &#163;500 million over five years. This represents an increase of 150 per cent on our original commitment for the reconstruction of Afghanistan made in Tokyo in January 2002 to provide &#163;200 million over these five years (the financial years 2002&#150;03 to 2006&#150;07). So far we have provided &#163;110.5 million of this. This new pledge will include at least &#163;75 million a year for reconstruction, plus assistance for counter-narcotics and conflict prevention.
<P>

<a name="40301-42_para6"></a>One of the major challenges Afghanistan faces is security, particularly in the south and east of the country, and the need to tackle the drugs trade. The UK is working to support the Afghan police and helping to build a new Afghan national army. We are also assisting with the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants. Our new financial commitment will help to address all these issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301-42_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  I made a Statement to this House on 19 January on airlinks between the Falklands and Argentina (Official Report col. <i>WS39</i>). I would like to report on developments since then.
<P>

<a name="40301-42_para7"></a>My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Rammell) travelled to Argentina on 16 to 17 February on a preplanned bilateral visit. He held talks on a wide range of international, regional and bilateral issues. The question of airlinks featured in talks with the Argentine Foreign Minister, Dr Rafael Bielsa. The talks were frank and constructive and they made some progress. Some proposals were discussed which they each agreed to look at further. These proposals primarily focussed on temporary arrangements for charter flights for 2004. Mr Rammell made clear that any arrangements would need to be acceptable to the Falkland Islanders.
<P>

<a name="40301-42_para8"></a>Regrettably, shortly following the visit, an article appeared in an Argentine newspaper, giving details of the talks and wrongly asserting that a "deal" on airlinks had been agreed. As Mr Rammell has indicated, this was not the case.
<P>

<a name="40301-42_para9"></a>Mr Rammell spoke subsequently to Falkland Councillors. They concluded that the proposals for temporary arrangements did not meet their concerns. However, they agreed that we should continue to discuss the issue with the Argentine Government with a view to securing a permanent solution to the question of charter flights rather than having further temporary arrangements.

<A NAME="40301-43_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </B>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

<P>

<a name="40301-43_para0"></a>A new call-out order has been made under Section 56 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 so that Reservists may continue to be called out to support operations in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The order will take effect from 1 March 2004, the date the previous order expires. There are no plans to call out Reservists compulsorily under this order as it is expected that the small numbers needed will be met through volunteers for service in those countries.

<A NAME="40301-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Mr Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40301-43_para1"></a>On 17 April 2003, with the generous support of the Royal Mail Group, the Ministry of Defence introduced a free postal service to enable families to post packets up to 2 kg free of charge to BFPO addresses in the Gulf. The provision of a free packet service recognised the difficult conditions personnel were operating in and that it was not possible to provide the full spectrum of welfare support normally available to personnel on operations. While southern Iraq is not yet a benign environment, the level of welfare support and the facilities available on Operation TELIC are now comparable to those provided in other operational theatres.
<P>

<a name="40301-43_para2"></a>It has therefore been decided that from 8 April 2004 with the handover of 20 Armoured Brigade to 1 Mechanised Brigade this free service will cease. This date should allow for any Easter gifts to be sent under the free service.
<P>

<a name="40301-43_para3"></a>In common with other operations, personnel in Iraq are provided with free forces air letters and their electronic counterparts ("Blueys" and "eblueys") in addition to free Internet access and free 20-minute phone calls each week. Families may also send packets up to 2 kg in weight to personnel in the Gulf at a concessionary rate&#151;the equivalent of the UK inland first class postal rate. The NAAFI/Expeditionary Forces Institute also sells through its outlets in theatre many of the small consumable items that families were previously sending to personnel and this has lead to a significant decline in the demand for the free packet service.

<P>

<a name="40301-43_para4"></a>London's bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games is focused on the Olympic Park in the lower Lea Valley. The London Development Agency submitted an outline planning application for the park and four ancillary applications to the Joint Planning Authorities Team (representing Newham, Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest London boroughs) on 30 January 2004. Decisions on these, and any subsequent applications, are matters for the local authorities concerned. However, it is possible that decisions in relation to these applications could fall to be determined by me as First Secretary of State (either on appeal or if applications were to be called in). I and other Ministers in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have other policy responsibilities, including the delivery of development and regeneration in the Thames Gateway and the role that the London Olympics bid might play in achieving these objectives. In order to ensure that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's <i>Guidance on Propriety Issues in the Handling of Planning Casework </i>is followed, I have decided that any planning decisions arising for the First Secretary of State in respect of development related to the Olympics bid will be dealt with by my honourable friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford. She will not be involved in any other matters relating to the Olympics bid.

<a name="40301-43_para6"></a>To determine the individual allocations the following formula was adopted:
<P>

<a name="40301-43_para7"></a>Each authority received &#163;53,000. Each county council received &#163;12,000 in respect of each shire district within the authority's boundaries. These flat-rate payments accounted for approximately 65 per cent of the aggregate grant in recognition of the fact that every authority, regardless of size and population, would incur similar unavoidable costs in conducting the basic civil protection function.
<P>

<a name="40301-43_para8"></a>The remaining 35 per cent of the aggregate grant was distributed according to the Bellwin threshold, using population size as a proxy for the scale of the civil protection that authorities need to undertake.
<P>

<a name="40301-43_para9"></a>This formula is retained by agreement with the Local Government Association.

<P>
<A NAME="40301w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Avebury </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many officials of the Afghan Government and of the United Nations are stationed in the province of Badakhshan.[HL1353]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  According to the Deputy Governor of Badakhshan, there are 12,112 paid employees of the Afghan Government working in the province. The UN has six international and 50 Afghan staff working in Badakhshan.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301w01_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What progress they have made to improve access to higher education for disabled students since the National Audit Office's finding in 2002 that an 18-year-old with a disability or other health problem has a 40 per cent chance of access compared with other students; and what impact they expect their new proposals for higher education funding will have in improving that figure.[HL1415]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  The Government are keen to ensure that students with disabilities receive the best support possible so that they are able to study alongside their fellow students on an equal basis.
<P>

<a name="40301w01_para0"></a>HESA figures for 2001&#150;02 suggest the proportion of higher education students with self-declared disabilities has grown from 4.6 per cent in 1996&#150;97 to 6 per cent in 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="40301w01_para1"></a>The disabled students' allowances (DSAs) are available to students with disabilities attending or undertaking courses of higher education, who by reason of their disability, incur additional expenditure as a result of their attendance on the course. DSAs are paid in addition to the existing standard support package.
<P>

<a name="40301w01_para2"></a>The extension of DSAs to part-time undergraduates and full and part-time postgraduates in 2000&#150;01, including Open University students, has enabled more students with disabilities to enter higher education. An additional 3,235 DSAs were awarded in 2003&#150;04 compared to the previous year. Recently, the department has reviewed the administration of the
<P>


<a name="column_WA82"></a>

<B>1 Mar 2004 : Column WA82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>DSA scheme and engaged with representatives from the sector so that disabled students are able to access the scheme more quickly and efficiently.
<P>

<a name="40301w01_para3"></a>We have done much to increase awareness of the financial assistance available to disabled students. The booklet  Bridging the Gap: a guide to the Disabled Students' Allowance (DSAs) in Higher Education is specifically for disabled students, with over 180,000 copies available in 2004&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="40301w01_para4"></a>The introduction of the new student finance arrangements will assist disabled students in the same way as non-disabled students, in that they will not pay fees up front, and loans will be written off after 25 years.
<P>

<a name="40301w01_para5"></a>"Aimhigher" aims to increase participation in higher education from under-represented groups. The planning guidance for the new integrated Aimhigher programme, which starts in August 2004, lists disabled students as an under-represented group for whom local partnerships should seek to widen access.
<P>

<a name="40301w01_para6"></a>Extra funding has been granted to universities to improve support and facilities for disabled students. Institutions receive HEFCE funding to recruit and support students with disabilities. A total of &#163;10 million is allocated in this way in 2003&#150;04 within the funding for widening access and improving retention.
<P>

<a name="40301w01_para7"></a>Additionally HEFCE is providing &#163;117 million to improve provision for students with special needs, in line with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, and its extension in the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001. Funding is available between April 2004 and March 2006 to improve the physical and IT infrastructure for students with disabilities. For example these may include signage for visually impaired, flashing fire alarms and hearing loops, wider doors, ramps, lifts and special IT or other equipment.

<P>
<A NAME="40301w01_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by the Baroness Ashton of Upholland on 10 December 2002 (WA 21) concerning honours degrees, what were the equivalent figures for (a) 2003; (b) 1998; and (c) 1993. [HL1457]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  Data for the number of first degree graduates in 1993 were published by the Universities Statistical Record and give figures for the total number of first degrees and the number of first class honours degrees only. These and figures for first degree graduates in 1998 and 2003, which are taken from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, are given in the tables.

<A NAME="40301w02_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Warwick </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether&#151;
<P>
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2>(a) a quarter of National Health Service nurses are now aged 50 or over and most of them plan to retire when they are 58; and
<P>
<P>
<br>
(b) there is a 15 to 20 per cent drop-out rate from nurse training courses;
<P>
and, if so, why and how they intend to address the situation.[HL1255]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40301w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  As at September 2002, 19 per cent of qualified nurses employed in the National Health Service were aged 50 and over. This is in line with the expected age profile of the workforce. Information is not collected centrally on when nurses intend to retire.
<P>

<a name="40301w02_para0"></a>Extending the participation of older staff is a key part of our strategy to meet our workforce targets. The Department of Health is promoting flexible retirement through the Improving Working Lives initiative to encourage nurses to consider alternatives to retiring, such as reducing their commitment or taking on new roles.
<P>

<a name="40301w02_para1"></a>The latest complete information on attrition from nurse training courses relates to the 1997&#150;98 cohort and was 20 per cent. The Human Resource Performance Framework published in October 2000 sets a target of 13 per cent attrition for students entering nurse training in 2000&#150;01. Workforce development confederations are working with higher education institutions to ensure that this target is achieved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   There are safeguards in place to protect the safety and quality of public water supplies. The effects on public health would depend on the concentration and the amount ingested from any contamination of public water supplies. Nationally agreed medical and public health briefings on aldicarb, and a public information sheet, are available to healthcare professionals through the National Poisons Information Service. The National Health Service has plans for major incidents and would be supported by advice from appropriate experts.

<P>
<A NAME="40301w02_wqn4"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether Ofcom has been given any statutory duties or powers under the Communications Act 2003 to receive or act upon complaints about pornographic and paedophilic images shown on the internet.[HL1229]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40301w02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville:  </B>  Ofcom has no direct duties or powers to receive or act on complaints about images of child abuse or other pornographic images shown on the Internet. However, Ofcom has responsibility for approving the industry code for premium rate services, which is administered and enforced by the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS). Ofcom also has the power to enforce breaches of the approved code by imposing fines or ultimately suspending the right to provide services.
<P>

<a name="40301w02_para4"></a>The Government believe that co- and self-regulation are more appropriate than statutory regulation of content specific to the Internet. We support the role of the Internet Watch Foundation, which was established by the Internet industry in consultation with the Government. The Internet Watch Foundation works in partnership with Internet service providers, telecommunications companies, mobile operators, software providers, police and Government, to minimise the availability of illegal Internet content, particularly child abuse images. Its Internet hotline deals with reports of potentially illegal Internet content, such as websites, newsgroups and online groups that contain images of child abuse anywhere in the world; adult material that potentially breaches the Obscene Publications Act in the UK; and criminally racist material in the UK.
<P>

<a name="40301w02_para5"></a>One measure of the success of this self-regulatory approach is that less than 2 per cent of the illegal content reported to the IWF relates to material hosted in the UK.

<P>
<A NAME="40301w02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville:  </B>  Lord Sainsbury of Turville refused to answer the question put to him on 11 February by the noble Baroness on the grounds that he disagreed profoundly with the assumption on which it was based.
