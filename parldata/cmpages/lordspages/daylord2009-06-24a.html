However, the Government have been considering proposals to speed up the process for some time. The difficulty is that a statement taken in one jurisdiction is not admissible in court in the other jurisdiction in either direction, and a piece of evidence on one side of the border cannot be taken to the other side, either for investigative purposes or for production in court, without involving three separate sets of officials&#151;in Belfast, London and Dublin&#151;and thus it takes six months or so to move a single piece of evidence. This is simply not acceptable and must be sorted out as soon as possible.</p>

I know that the speed of justice, when it comes to relations between two nations, is extremely slow. Therefore, I imagine that there will be difficulties with cases that involve cross-border matters, or the United Kingdom and another member state of the European Union. I am sadly confident that there will be similar delays. If that is not the case, I will come back to the noble Lord.</p>

Given the scale of malnutrition, homelessness and deprivation in Gaza, will the Government support Egypt&#146;s proposal for a technical and humanitarian committee nominated by both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas to organise access for essential incoming supplies?

The Government have no knowledge of the details of the proposal that the noble Lord enunciated about a new committee. The UK&#146;s priority is that humanitarian and recovery aid should reach the people of Gaza. We have well developed international mechanisms for doing that, including the UNRWA, the World Bank and the International Committee of the Red Cross. We strongly support the UN&#146;s role in this. However, recovery and reconstruction will necessarily involve consultation with numerous local and international actors. We are doing all that we can to ensure greater access.</p>

That dialogue comes about by getting the international actors to put pressure on the local actors. The fact that this was done in the form of a speech by the American President is an opportunity for a step forward, which the UK Government strongly support.</p>

DfID has just had to pay &#163;40,000 simply to store vehicles that have not been allowed into Gaza since February.

Undoubtedly, Israel is concerned about what it sees as an attempt to smuggle arms and other ordnance, as is shown in the way in which it is denying access to goods that other people consider to be perfectly reasonable. We have to find a way through that meets the security concerns of the Israeli Government and the absolute and urgent needs of the Palestinian people.</p>

We are unsure about whether hard evidence for that assumption exists, because our figures show that the number of absentees continues to fall year on year. There is no doubt that we need to be imaginative about how we keep those 14 year-olds who, for a variety of reasons, are not staying in school&#151;some have chaotic lives and some are disaffected with traditional teaching. This can involve part-time school, one-to-one teaching or the kind of qualifications that the noble Lord has mentioned, which I am not familiar with, so I will need to come back to him on that. However, there is no doubt that vocational training off-site and all of those areas are important in keeping our 14 year-olds in school and engaged with education.</p>

In 2008, we produced a publication on that. We are concerned to provide education for the 135,000 pupils a year who need to spend time outside mainstream settings, many of whom are very vulnerable. For example, we have online directory providers and we are working with the voluntary sector to use organisations, such as Barnardo&#146;s and Nacro, to provide the sort of programmes that will help to get those children back to school or will provide them with the right qualifications that they will need to move on with their lives.</p>

The applications for universities this year have increased by 60,000. The Government&#146;s cuts mean that hardly any extra places will be given to universities.

Our thoughts are also with the families and friends of the five Britons taken hostage in Baghdad in 2007, particularly those of Jason Creswell and Jason Swindlehurst.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09062475000056"></a>On the Question, the safety of UK personnel serving in Afghanistan is of paramount importance.

We also send our condolences to the family of Major Sean Birchall of the Welsh Guards, who was killed by an IED. Indeed, IEDs have killed 10 of the last 11 soldiers to die in Afghanistan and have left many other soldiers with life-changing injuries.

We take seriously and appreciate the work of the DSTL, which has done a great deal to advance our knowledge of the IEDs that are being used and, indeed, in some cases to anticipate future developments. The issue is difficult, ever changing and challenging, but a lot of good work is done on it domestically and, indeed, in theatre. On the reporting of IEDs by people in Afghanistan, we try to get information from and we try to build bridges with local communities. People are fearful of giving information, but we try to establish a situation where, if it is at all possible, such co-operation will exist.</p>

Apart from service personnel killed and injured by IEDs, my understanding is that around 86 per cent of those killed are Afghan nationals, so it is a serious problem.

This shows the callousness of the insurgents, who are quite willing to kill their fellow countrymen and to disregard the needs of local communities. He is right also that the United States is extremely concerned about IEDs and has suffered casualties because of them. It invests a lot in the development of counter-IED work, as do we.

Employer-led and essentially working with the assessment bodies such as City and Guilds and Edexcel, they have developed frameworks for different vocational qualifications, including apprenticeships, which play an important part among those qualifications. Recently, they have also been given an important role in the development of diplomas and, hence, are increasingly recognised by the Government as bodies to talk about the training needs and qualifications in specific sectors.</p>

<a name="90624-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09062475000070"></a>Although SSCs are recognised by the Government as having an important role, they are not recognised in the Bill. The reason, I suspect, is that the parliamentary draftsman never likes writing into Bills the names of bodies which may be transient. In the past 30 years or so, we have had quite a number of transient bodies in this area, such as the Manpower Services Commission, the sector working parties, the national training organisations, the TECs&#151;and now we have the sector skills councils. Perhaps, rightly, the parliamentary draftsman thought, &#147;What next?&#148;. So instead of writing them into the Bill by name, they are written in by description. Clause 37 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09062475000244"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State must by order specify sectors of skill, trade or occupation for the purposes of this Chapter&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09062475000228"></a>the chapter being Chapter 1, which is all about apprenticeships. It then states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09062475000245"></a>&#147;The sectors ... must in the opinion of the Secretary of State encompass the full range of skills, trades and occupations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062475000229"></a>Although the clause effectively describes sector skills councils, it does not say who they are or what they should do. Amendment 15 seeks to fill that gap, referring to Clause 11(1), which, as it stands, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09062475000246"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may designate a person&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09062475000230"></a>which in parliamentary speak means a body&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09062475000262"></a>&#147;to issue apprenticeship frameworks generally, or ... to issue apprenticeship frameworks relating to a particular apprenticeship sector&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062475000231"></a>I am concerned about the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="09062475000263"></a>&#147;to issue apprenticeship frameworks generally&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062475000232"></a>What does that mean and what does &#147;generally&#148; mean in this context? It is a very general phrase and not at all explicit. The amendment tries to make the issue very much more explicit, first by saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09062475000247"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may ... designate a person to issue general guidelines in relation to the apprenticeship functions&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09062475000233"></a>functions that include issuing apprenticeship frameworks, but also in relation to other features of the apprenticeship system set up by the Bill. Secondly, it picks up the terminology of Clause 37, which empowers the Secretary of State to,</p>
<ul><a name="09062475000264"></a>&#147;specify sectors ... for the purposes of this Chapter&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062475000234"></a>and says that the Secretary of State shall &#147;designate a person to issue&#148; frameworks for specific sectors&#151;not necessarily the same person as in subsection (1). It can be a different body or person that issues the frameworks for specific sectors.</p>

<a name="90624-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09062475000071"></a>Amendment 15 sets up on the one hand the concept of the National Apprenticeship Service. Perhaps we will come back to and vote on at Report stage my amendments from the previous occasion when we debated the Bill, which were about the service being  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1583"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1583</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>set up on its own as an NDPB. It is already being set up and is a shadow authority; it is actually doing some extremely good things. We have the National Apprenticeship Service as the general overseeing body under the Skills Funding Agency and the sector skills councils as the specific bodies responsible for issuing the frameworks in their own specific sectors, as they do at the moment.</p>

<a name="90624-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09062475000072"></a>Amendments 30 and 31 relate to the transition arrangements spelt out in Clause 15 and say that the Secretary of State should consult the sector skills councils, which, after all, have set up the existing qualifications frameworks for apprenticeships, if they are to be treated as substantive frameworks, as specified in Clause 12. We are asking the Secretary of State to consult the appropriate authorities before making this move and defining those appropriate authorities to include the sector skills councils. Using the terminology of the amendment, we refer to those persons designated to issue frameworks in relation to a specific sector and the representatives of those involved in vocational education and training&#151;the colleges, the alternative learning providers, City and Guilds and so forth.</p>

<a name="90624-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09062475000073"></a>I have four questions for the Minister. In subsection (1)(a) there is the phrase,</p>

<p><a name="09062475000235"></a>What is meant by that? Why is no role specified in the Bill for sector skills councils, which the Government have spent so much time setting up? They have been doing quite an effective job, so why are they not incorporated specifically in the Bill? Why do the Government think it unnecessary to consult such organisations over the transitional arrangements? I beg to move.</p>

They are a helpful intermediary to represent the needs of industry. It is crucial that they are involved in producing apprenticeship frameworks to ensure high standards and apprenticeships that stay in line with the needs of employers, making them better and more effective. The Government may claim that they already intend sector skills councils to be issuing bodies&#151;indeed, the Explanatory Notes say that&#151;but if so, why not put that in the Bill?</p>

The Government have assured us that sector skills councils will play an essential role in all of this. But that is hard for people to understand. I am not saying that people will not believe it, but the Bill does not appear to reflect the tremendous role that the Government themselves recognised when they set up the sector skills councils.</p>

Amendment 15 would limit the Secretary of State&#146;s powers so that he can designate a person to issue frameworks only in relation to a particular sector and not to issue frameworks generally. However, even where a designated person&#151;to answer the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp&#151;issues frameworks generally, the frameworks still have to relate to an apprenticeship sector.</p>

<a name="90624-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09062475000077"></a>I join noble Lords on all sides who have paid tribute to the work of the sector skills councils and standard setting bodies. They are absolutely right: they have played an integral part in our apprenticeship strategy. They have worked with employers, who after all make up the sector skills councils, to ensure that when we talk about a demand-led approach we really mean that. They have created 180 different apprenticeship frameworks, which show what viable bodies they are. That is not to say that they have necessarily reached a state of perfection, as the recent relicensing process shows, but nevertheless, by and large, they have been doing excellent work. They come under the ambit of the UKCES. I am happy to confirm again for the avoidance of doubt that sector skills councils remain absolutely central to our plans for apprenticeships moving forward. We cannot establish apprenticeship frameworks without sector skills councils.</p>

<a name="90624-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09062475000078"></a>Last year, we set out in <I>World Class Apprenticeships</I> our commitment to streamlining and reducing bureaucracy in the process of developing and approving apprenticeship frameworks. That is a vital thing that we need to reform. It has taken far too long&#151;sometimes years&#151;to establish a new apprenticeship framework and we definitely need to improve performance in that area. We made it clear last year that we would designate the sector skills councils as the issuing authorities for apprenticeship frameworks. I am happy to reiterate that commitment now. There is no dubiety or equivocation on our part. They lie at the heart of determining new apprenticeship frameworks.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90624-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90624-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09062475000079"></a>I know that some noble Lords have questioned why, if that is the case, we did not simply name the sector skills councils as the issuing authorities on the face of the Bill. We heard that understandable request today. There are two reasons. First, the sector skills councils are a dynamic group of organisations that have evolved and will continue to evolve and improve over time. They are not fixed in concrete. They will change as the demands of the industry change in that particular sector. The legislative structure in the Bill is intended to allow and encourage organic change over time, without the need to wait for legislative change.</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09062475000080"></a>Secondly, there is a technical reason&#151;that as many of the sector skills councils are private companies limited by guarantee, to refer to them directly would render the Bill hybrid, which would require more complex and time-consuming parliamentary procedure. That is a real concern. The power included in Clause 11(1)(a) to designate a person to issue apprentice frameworks generally, rather than relating to a particular sector, was included for use only in exceptional circumstances. For example, if it becomes clear that there are frameworks that do not have a natural home in a single sector skills council, it might be better for a   


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1585"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1585</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>single body to issue such apprenticeship frameworks while a home sector skills council is identified, so that potential apprentices are not disadvantaged.</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09062475000081"></a>I can assure the House that this power would only be used following close consultation with, or in response to representations from, the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils, which is the representative body of sector skills councils. Indeed in all likelihood, it would be the alliance that we would naturally turn to, to take on this role. I also reassure noble Lords that the intention behind this clause is not to issue a generic apprenticeship framework&#151;that would run counter to our policy and anyway Clause 10(2)(b) makes it clear that the framework must relate to a particular skill, trade or occupation in an apprenticeship sector.</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09062475000082"></a>That said, I understand the concerns that this clause has caused among the sector skills councils and standard-setting bodies. Those concerns have been expressed most eloquently by noble Lords, and I want to reflect further on today&#146;s debate. I want the dialogue that has started today to continue, and in particular I want to reflect in advance of Report on whether there is another way through the Bill, in which we can ensure that the sort of disadvantage to apprentices that I have described does not arise. Amendments 30 and 31 would require the Secretary of State to consult FE colleges, other training providers, employers, sector skills councils and other key stakeholders before providing by order that existing vocational specifications are to be treated as if they were an apprenticeship framework issued under Section 12(1).</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09062475000083"></a>Clause 15 is a necessary transitional measure to ensure that when the requirements of the specifications and standards for England are brought into force, an apprentice who is already undertaking an apprenticeship is not disadvantaged. I am happy to confirm to the House that our intention is that all existing frameworks will be deemed to be recognised under Clause 12 until they are revised or replaced to ensure compliance with the new specification of apprenticeship standards for England. That really is vitally important&#151;there will be a whole group of apprentices who will be completing their apprenticeships within today&#146;s standards, as defined under the blueprint, and we do not want those apprentices to be disadvantaged in any way, or for what they are doing to be called into doubt. However, all those frameworks will have to, in the end, comply with the new specification of apprenticeship standards for England. Any deemed framework still remaining will cease to be recognised on the day after the school leaving date for 2013. There is a cut-off date, and it is purely a transitional arrangement.</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09062475000084"></a>Throughout this transitional period, the SSCs will continue to lead on the development and issuing of apprenticeship frameworks. It is neither practical nor desirable to consult the range of institutions that may have some involvement in delivering existing frameworks, when determining whether they should be available during the transitional period. They have already been consulted on in the past, and they are existing apprenticeship frameworks. Given these assurances, and my firm commitment to reflect further on the question of Clause 11(1)(a), I hope that noble Lords would feel able to withdraw their amendments.</p>

I find it slightly odd, when he says that we cannot establish apprenticeships without sector skills councils, that he then says there is not a place for them in the Bill. There is a subtle difference with what the Bill itself says. Clause 11 says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09062475000248"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may designate a person ... to issue apprenticeship frameworks generally, or ... to issue apprenticeship frameworks relating to a particular apprenticeship sector&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062475000236"></a>&#147;A person&#148; is, in this context, the National Apprenticeship Service, which, as I say, is already set up as shadow authority and is doing good work. So the National Apprenticeship Service both designates the general guidelines for frameworks and then specifies them within each sector skills council. Sector skills councils, according to the current wording of the Bill, play no part whatsoever.</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09062475000086"></a>We took on board the Minister&#146;s point about it being a hybrid authority and so forth, so we have carefully used exactly the same wording used in the Bill&#151;</p>

I pointed out in my contribution that they will determine the framework. We have indicated that the most likely person or organisation would not be the National Apprenticeship Service, but the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils. They are the people with the experience in determining apprenticeship frameworks. With all due respect to the National Apprenticeship Service, which does a wonderful job, that is not its sphere of operation. The employers represented on the sector skills councils in consultation with their employer bodies know what is required. There is no way that we are going to undermine the role of the sector skills councils.</p>

If the sector skills councils are mentioned in the Bill, their position is secure. If they are not, their continuance depends on the whim of central government, which cannot change them without legislation. The noble Baroness wants more than a ministerial assurance from a member of a Government which, whatever their fortunes, will not last very much longer. She would prefer something on statute, which would give some reassurance to people in the&#151;I was going to say &#147;the trade&#148;&#151;profession, that things would continue as the noble Lord says that they will, even when he is not there to guarantee it.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09062475000250"></a>&#147;The English issuing authority may issue an apprenticeship framework that the authority is satisfied meets the requirements specified, by the specification of apprenticeship standards for England&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062475000096"></a>It goes on. If it had read &#147;specified in the specification of apprenticeship standards for England&#148;, it would have been clear that I was looking for a theme rather than a process. However, when we get to Clauses 22 to 26, we find that the people doing the specification are, in England, the chief executive of skills funding&#151;with the endorsement of the Secretary of State&#151;and, in Wales, the Welsh Ministers off their own bat. It would be convenient to name them here and get around that little difficulty. If you try to pass the sentence as I first saw it, there is a perfectly clear object in the requirements, but no visible subject for the verb. That is the maze that I got myself into. I am suggesting a way out of it that does not do violence that I can see to any of the Government&#146;s principles, and is, by three or four syllables, a fraction shorter.</p>

<a name="09062475000098"></a><b><a name="90624-0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09062475000372"></a>Lord Rowlands:</b> I take the opportunity to make some observations on Amendment 32. Before doing so, I draw attention to my interest as president of the National Training Federation for Wales and as an adviser to a south Wales charity, Tydfil Training. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, seeks in Amendment 32 to make a modest amendment to Clause 17. This is one of a number of clauses that devolves authority and responsibility to Welsh Assembly Ministers. We should take this opportunity to discover a little more about the nature of this devolution because it has some history.</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09062475000099"></a>The original draft apprenticeship Bill that was the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny ran into considerable confusion, if not difficulty, over the issue of what was being devolved. There was considerable confusion in the Welsh Assembly&#146;s deliberations in committees. As I recall, a Select Committee of the other House made some tart observations about the lack of clarity over what was and was not being devolved. My first question for my noble friend is: are the clauses, including Clause 17, now fully agreed with the Welsh Assembly? Have the problems and difficulties that were thrown up by the original draft apprenticeship Bill now been resolved? Is there now a clear distinction as to who will be responsible for what?</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09062475000100"></a>Secondly, Clauses 16 and 17 envisage a situation where apprenticeship frameworks in Wales could differ from those in England. That is how I read them and, I think, how the noble Lord, Lord Elton, reads them. Welsh Ministers, through the designated persons, whoever they might be, may indeed come up with variations on the frameworks, which would differ from those devised in England. I do not know if that will be the case, but it seems inevitable, unless it is a pure formality. I suspect that it is not and possible variations may well occur in the way that apprenticeship frameworks are developed in Wales and England.</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09062475000101"></a>I want to draw the attention of the Committee to that issue. Like many other noble Lords, when I thought of apprenticeships in my youth, I assumed that an apprentice was someone who was between 16 and 19 years of age who had left school, having got his O-levels or GCSEs, and did not choose to pursue the A-level route. In Wales, the average age of an apprentice is now 25 years and three months. The large majority are no longer 16 and 17-year-olds, but adults in employment who want to upskill in different ways. It is a very different scene from the traditional view.</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09062475000102"></a>Can my noble friend say how that compares with the English scene? Are the average English apprentices still 16 to 19-year-olds, or are they adults in work, seeking to upskill, as in Wales? If so, we can see how the changing demands and needs of adults as opposed to 16 and 17-year-olds would have to be met in the workplace. I shall not press this further but there needs to be a degree of conformity. It is an interesting revelation on the nature of apprenticeships, so is the pattern of apprenticeships different in England? That is my first question.</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09062475000103"></a>Secondly, I suspect, although I have no reason for that other than an instinct, that another reason why there may be differences and variations in apprenticeship frameworks is that a considerable difference has now opened up between the Welsh and English education scenes. The Welsh Assembly Government have not pursued the line of extending the compulsory learning age to 18, so there will perhaps not be the same demand as that which may emerge in England. Apprenticeship programmes in England may take some of the strain of the additional demand created by the compulsory learning age being increased to 18. The Welsh Assembly Government have refused to adopt the English model. We could debate the respective merits, but it might mean that a different pattern of apprenticeships will emerge between Wales and England. Under this clause, is it possible to have different apprenticeship frameworks because of a different response to a different demand?</p>

<a name="90624-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09062475000104"></a>Whatever variations may or may not occur, I trust, hope and pray that there will be a way of mutually recognising them. We need portable skills. We do not want to draw boundaries across skills, especially as people may be required to work in different environments and different geographical areas. I hope that that can be accommodated if and when variations occur. We can see from the Explanatory Notes that in England it is likely that the skills council will fulfil the role. There is just a designated person in the case of Wales; the Explanatory Notes are silent on who may or may not fulfil that role. I hope that my noble friend can illuminate who might be that designated person. The noble Lord has given us the opportunity to explore the variations that may take place as a result of the devolution of responsibility to Welsh Assembly Ministers.</p>

I simply want to clarify matters, speaking as someone who is heavily involved in sector skills councils. These councils go across all four nations and will have the same role in Wales as they do in England. I shall not comment on the statistics. My guess is that the figures will be very much the same, but I am sure that my noble friend will have those in detail. In Wales, individuals will receive a certificate of completion for a modern apprenticeship, exactly as happens in England, but in Wales not only will it be written in Welsh but it will also define where in Wales the apprenticeship has been completed. That is the only difference.</p>

Several noble Lords spoke at Second Reading about the complexity and convoluted nature of the Bill. The purpose of amendments such as these is to help us to avoid the Bill passing into law with its current ambiguities. Anyone reading the Bill for the first time would have to read until Clause 22 to gain a definition of the specification of apprenticeship standards. The British Chambers of Commerce have referred to the shifting complexity of the further education system as encouraging the disengagement of employers. It is thus doubly important to ensure that the Bill is tidied up and that it does not become a further cause of employer disengagement. Therefore, I strongly request the Minister to give the amendments of my noble friend Lord Elton the consideration that they deserve.</p>

During the development of the draft Bill, we worked with all the devolved Administrations, including the Welsh Assembly Government, as part of the devolution settlement to allow the devolved Administrations to decide for themselves how they want powers to be exercised in the devolved areas. The Welsh Assembly Government Ministers are keen that the statutory apprenticeships established under Part 1 of the Bill cover Wales. The Bill includes provisions in respect of the operation of statutory apprenticeships in Wales, requested by Welsh Assembly Government Ministers. We are already working with the Welsh Assembly Government to ensure a coherent approach in both countries and qualifications that are recognised on both sides of the border. That is fundamentally important. I thank my noble friend Lady Wall for her partnership approach and I am glad that she made the very relevant point that sector skills councils operate across the United Kingdom.</p>

I was not aware of that interesting piece of information about the average age for apprenticeships. Yes, we have removed the age barrier and, therefore, we have had a significant increase in adult apprenticeships. They have played a very important part in reskilling adults. In England, I think we had about 27,000 adult apprenticeships last year. We have a bit of a problem in the 16 to 18 age range, and that is where the National Apprenticeship Service is focusing a lot of its attention. We are also trying to ensure that, with regard to the requirement on government departments to create more apprenticeships&#151;they have pledged a further 21,000&#151;they, too, will have to focus on the 16 to 18 age range.</p>

Clause 14 expands this premise, so that a person may submit a draft of an apprenticeship framework to the English issuing authority, or request that the authority issue a draft. The provisions seem very sensible. They will allow for ease and transparency in the creation of an apprenticeship framework and greater co-operation between bodies such as sector skills councils and standards-setting bodies, which we hope will be at the forefront of the process of constructing apprenticeship frameworks.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09062475000123"></a>Amendment 27 affects subsection (3) of the clause, which allows the issuing authority to exercise its judgment and decide not to issue the framework in the form of a draft, as long as the person who requested the draft is given reasons for the refusal. There are occasions where this discretionary power may be useful. It may be that there are very similar frameworks already extant, or about to be issued, and the bureaucracy and work involved in producing a draft framework is not considered worth while. It may be that the final version of the document is due to be published very shortly, and it is simply not practicable also to produce a draft.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09062475000124"></a>Our amendment seeks only to ensure that the authority must inform the person who requested the draft within two weeks of making its decision. While it seems sensible for the issuing authority to reserve the right not to publish a draft apprenticeship framework, this must be balanced by the right of the person who requests the draft to be informed quickly and efficiently of the reasons why no draft will be forthcoming. The Bill requires that the person be informed of these reasons, but does not include a specific time limit. Does the Minister not accept that this might lead to uncertainty? The person who requested the draft framework could be left in the dark about whether he is waiting to receive a draft or a rejection notice.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09062475000125"></a>The reassurance in the Bill that reasons will be provided is weakened by the fact that there is no timeframe in which to call the issuing authority to account. We argue that two weeks is sufficient time for the authority to give the reasons for its decision on whether a framework can be delivered. It is hard to think of an occasion when the issuing authority would be so busy that it would not be able to do so within this time. However, I await the Minister&#146;s response with interest. I beg to move.</p>

Sector skills councils will have done their research, consulted a lot of people and put a great deal of time and effort into the framework. There may well be young people who have already been alerted to the possibility and who are waiting to hear. A long delay is unreasonable. Some of the young people may well go off in other directions or disappear entirely if they are not given a prompt response. I hope that the Minister will take on board the fact that the Bill would be strengthened by containing a time span in which a response is to be received.</p>

We intend to issue statutory guidance alongside the technical aspects of the SASE, which will stress the importance of prompt decision-making and of alerting framework

In the light of the points made in today&#146;s debate, I am happy to confirm that we will include in the statutory guidance a requirement for the issuing authority to give reasons within two weeks if it decides not to issue a framework. Including that requirement in guidance rather than in the Bill will allow for greater flexibility to adjust the period in future in the light of experience; for example, we may be able to address the concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, about why it should take two weeks.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09062475000134"></a>We believe that the statutory guidance is the right place for this. We are at one with the Committee. It would be nonsense that, once a decision has been reached, this should take an unnecessary length of time. I cannot predict at this point whether two weeks is too long. My feeling is to ask the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, of why it should take two weeks, but that reinforces the point that we are trying to make. We are at one with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley; we want to speed up the process and remove any unnecessary delay. We believe that the right place to do that is within statutory guidance so that we can alter it in the light of experience.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09062475000135"></a>We agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, about the need to ensure that, as I said, the whole approval process for frameworks is speeded up. These are not new situations that we are encountering; at least, it may be a new situation, but we have been through the process many times before. Until recently, apprenticeship frameworks were submitted to an apprenticeship approval group, which met every two to three months. The new framework issuing system will streamline the process and applicants will develop their framework using clear guidance and templates with the support of the sector skills council. We should obtain a high standard of frameworks submitted, which should speed up the whole process. We will look to the UK Commission for Employment and Skills and the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils to ensure that a system of approving and issuing frameworks is working in terms of timeliness and effectiveness. I hope that, on the basis of these assurances and on the clear understanding that we share the same commitment, the noble Lord will be persuaded to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="09062475000137"></a><b><a name="90624-0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09062475000392"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> I contemplated rising to discuss my amendment during the previous debate because the issues that I want to raise are related, although they are somewhat wider. I am always doubtful about a clause that appears to be important but is not discussed in the Explanatory Notes. Clause 14 is not mentioned and I wondered why. It seems widely drawn. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09062475000254"></a>&#147;This section applies if a person .... submits a draft&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062475000237"></a>I imagine that the person could be your Lordships&#146; House proposing to set up a framework for some maintenance apprenticeships. Indeed, the Houses of Parliament have, I believe, gone into a programme of apprenticeships. It could be any person, in the private or public sector. The Minister has referred once or twice to there being 180 frameworks. In Australia, there are 500 frameworks. At some point during these debates, it would be interesting to know how many frameworks the Government believe that there might eventually be.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09062475000138"></a>One can imagine circumstances in which people want to get on with drafting a framework and under Clause 14(2) they have,</p>
<ul><a name="09062475000266"></a>&#147;to provide such information and evidence&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062475000238"></a>as is required. I have a worry that, under any statutory arrangements, the amount of time taken to consider information and evidence is likely to be a lot longer than two weeks. The determination of the decision and the amount of time that it takes to convey that decision will not be the most serious problem with Clause 14; I should think that it will be much more a question of how long the authorising body takes to consider the draft framework and such information and evidence in connection with it as it thinks appropriate.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09062475000139"></a>My amendment would add a further subsection:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09062475000255"></a>&#147;Nothing in this section prevents a person from carrying out training in conformity with a draft submission made under subsection (1)&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062475000239"></a>I would have preferred to refer to &#147;an apprenticeship or training&#148;, but I guessed that, because the apprenticeship system is statutory, the Government would not like that and would say, &#147;I am terribly sorry, you cannot have an apprenticeship unless we agree that it is one&#148;. I am completely opposed to that, but never mind; the word &#147;training&#148; will probably do.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09062475000140"></a>I am seeking an unequivocal assurance that no one will try to prevent a person who has drafted an apprenticeship framework from getting on with putting that framework into practice, albeit that they cannot call it an apprenticeship in the formal statutory sense. I think that it is a very good idea that persons should be able to put up draft apprenticeship frameworks. First, we have only 180 such frameworks and Australia has 500. The second reason is the pace of change. As I said  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1597"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1597</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at Second Reading, I simply do not believe that the Secretary of State will ever keep up with what is happening in business, commerce and manufacturing. He will never be able to know when a framework is appropriate, nor will his authorising authority, over which he has a great measure of control under the Bill.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09062475000141"></a>There is a great need, particularly at present, to rebalance our economy as rapidly as we can. In my opinion, we will find it very difficult to get back to the Treasury&#146;s trend rate of growth of about 2 to 2.5 per cent a year. It is much more likely that when we come out of this recession&#151;we may be edging our way out of it now&#151;the trend rate of growth will be 1 to 1.5 per cent or something of that order. We are all agreed that we need to expand the number of skills and the number of options open to us within our economy to rebalance it so that it is not so dependent on financial services and widens its dependence in a satisfactory way.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09062475000142"></a>As we have heard, this whole campaign applies very much to the public sector as well as to the private sector. As regards the power to disapprove, the question is: what follows? If there is a wish to control, what is likely to follow is an attempt to prevent people from doing what they want to do because it does not fit. It is very much a feature of the public sector system that it wishes to have this control and does not like eccentricity and difference or people doing things of which it is not itself cognisant.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09062475000143"></a>I have an example, although I regret to say that it is a level 3 rather than a level 2 example. In my days at Kew, we had a school and a diploma&#151;the Kew diploma, which I am happy to say still exists. I am now getting to be a piece of history because my time at Kew was from 1983 to 1991. During that time, we were under constant pressure to join the horticultural system. People asked, &#147;What is it about botanic gardening that is so different that you don&#146;t have to conform to the City and Guilds type of courses?&#148;. In fact, a senior member of the Kew teaching staff resigned because he believed that we should join the horticultural system and not stay as an exception offering a botanic gardening diploma. But we stuck it out; we said no. We were never within the official system because we kept saying no. This meant that we did not get so much support and public money as we might otherwise have got, but we retained the Kew diploma&#151;and the Kew diploma of botanic gardening is recognised all over the world.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09062475000144"></a>I am worried about the statutory apprenticeship system in the Bill because I am reasonably sure that it will not be run with what is called a light touch and will not leave people with the independence to get on with their own thing. Therefore, I would like to see it unequivocally stated in the Bill that everyone who has drawn up a draft framework can say, &#147;I am perfectly entitled under this legislation to get on with the training, in conformity with my draft framework, even though it has not been approved&#148;. I beg to move.</p>

However, if we are genuinely in the business of looking for flexibility and growth in the economy and have a genuine wish to see creativity within the education system, where people can develop things according to the needs of both those engaged in the apprenticeship and their employers, I hope that there will be room and flexibility within the provisions of the Bill for something that is outwith central control.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09062475000146"></a>There is absolutely no reason why prestigious companies should not develop their own frameworks for apprenticeships. I am morally certain that if someone came out having completed an apprenticeship with, let us say, Microsoft, they would be extremely desirable property in any other IT firm, which would have no interest whatever in whether or not the apprenticeship had been approved and accredited by the authorities in a particular country. There are international companies that will continue to offer training through apprenticeships to people of any age&#151;and certainly to 16 to 19 year-olds&#151;which will give those people &#147;hot property&#148; qualifications entirely dependent on the reputation of the company, not of some regulating authority.</p>

<a name="90624-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09062475000147"></a>We have here a basic clash of philosophies. The Bill tries to control everything, for understandable reasons. I fully understand why it is necessary to ensure that apprenticeships are of a high quality and that young people come out with a qualification that is recognised and tradeable when they go looking for jobs outwith the company where they did their apprenticeship. I have no problem with that. All I am asking for, and all my noble friend&#146;s amendment is asking for, is some flexibility so that in some instances and in some cases it will be possible for a company or a small firm to continue offering an apprenticeship even after it has been turned down for accreditation.</p>

However, in some senses, as I indicated in the discussion we had about the National Apprenticeship Service on the last occasion we met in Committee, the concept of pulling the sector skills councils together within the overall umbrella of the National Apprenticeship Service is fine, but the whole bureaucracy of establishing the apprenticeship system, with its necessary certificates and frameworks, seems very heavy handed. We had an interesting debate on Friday last week about the unnecessary amount of regulation within the education sector and the number of statutory instruments that have been issued by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, which is more than for any other department. I did a calculation on this Bill. Somewhere in the region of 100 statutory instruments are likely to be issued as a result of it. I do not have my

I share my noble friend&#146;s concern that the Bill may be too prescriptive in its regulations for apprenticeship frameworks. Amendments 28 and 33 would ensure that if a local authority failed to produce a requested apprenticeship framework the employer could still carry out the training as per the draft. It is vital that the Bill supports employers who submit a draft apprenticeship framework, as their involvement is the crucial factor in raising quality.</p>

All frameworks must meet the Specifications of Apprenticeship Standards for England and for Wales respectively before they can be issued, and there is a good reason for that.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09062475000154"></a>I admit that I thought that there was consensus within this Chamber about preserving the quality of apprenticeships, so let us think about what we are saying. Of course, we want flexibility. The fact that we have grown apprenticeships to 180 frameworks over a recent period demonstrates sufficient progress. I cannot comment on Australia having 500 while we have only 180; I can say only that we have responded to the demands of employers. I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, that we allow companies to go down the road of establishing their own self-accreditation, provided they meet standards. I reject the idea that we would wilfully obstruct the creation of apprenticeships with a process that would somehow delay it. We encourage sector skills councils in everything that we do. The UKCES, the body that examines them, is going through the relicensing process and looking carefully at how long the approval process takes. Were we to have a process whereby we laid down standards, reassuring one group of people that an apprenticeship was a quality product, while allowing another group to go ahead and say, &#147;Well, it doesn&#146;t matter. Actually, you submitted it. You didn&#146;t actually meet the standards, but you can carry on doing it&#148;, it would create horrendous confusion. Trying to make sure that the maximum number of apprenticeships is available is the first task that we face in convincing employers, parents and teachers that apprenticeships are a quality product&#151;and we have not yet finished that task by any means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09062475000155"></a>I would plead with your Lordships not to introduce a circumstance in which no one is sure about the status of a training programme&#151;is it or is it not an apprenticeship? We ourselves were accused of creating uncertainty with programme-led apprenticeships, and we tried to eliminate it by ensuring that there was a work-based agreement between the apprentice and the employer and that there was a job tied to the apprenticeship. People want quality and standards, and we have ensured those in these specifications. The abandonment of those would be a retrograde step, undermining much of our good work. We have seen employees and employers beginning to appreciate the value of apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09062475000156"></a>We do not want unnecessary bureaucracy in the approval process and we will take that point away to ensure that we do not introduce anything different. However, let us be clear about the demand for apprenticeship frameworks. It is a demand-led system that comes from employers. I do not want to get into the arcane nature of the debate at Kew about whether a qualification should be botanical or horticultural. No doubt people there agonised about that. We already have horticultural apprenticeships, but if employers demand a botanical apprenticeship, or if there is a specific need for one, there is nothing to prevent them going to the sector skills council to get that.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09062475000157"></a>The noble Baroness is right that it is a question of control. However, it is also one of quality and standards, and reassuring the public that they are getting a genuine end-product. It must not be something that an employer can continue with, recognised or not, suggesting that there is an apprenticeship framework which has met the standard when clearly there is not.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09062475000158"></a>We have an obligation to ensure that we do not obstruct progress and that we have a demand-led system that responds to the needs of employers. That is exactly what sector skills councils do because they are made up of employers. If the demand is there, there will be an apprenticeship framework. I will go away and investigate why Australia has 500 apprenticeship frameworks while we have only 180. We do not do much kangaroo rearing in this country, but I do not know what specific frameworks Australia has. I shall be interested to find out. The Leitch report was absolutely clear&#151;we set ourselves some very ambitious targets&#151;that by 2013 we will have in place the entitlement for all young people who want an apprenticeship to have one. That was clearly on the understanding that we were talking about a quality product.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09062475000159"></a>I understand the laudable intentions of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, but unfortunately there may be an unintended consequence regarding the system of quality control. We believe that quality control is vital if we are to sustain the reputation of apprenticeships. I hope that in those circumstances he will feel able to withdraw his amendment, taking into account the assurance that I have given to all noble Lords who have entered into this debate&#151;that we will be looking to ensure that we have not introduced any unnecessary bureaucracy in the approval process.</p>

They would never believe as a total class; there are from time to time eccentric employers who do not join in any of these processes. I stick to my point. I do not want to damage the statutory system&#151;may it work really well.

That is almost the longest part of what I have to say, as this is a very straightforward and simple amendment and your Lordships will either agree with it or not. The rather unwieldy term &#147;specification&#148; for the document to which we are referring is, to builders, naturally a theme, while to others it is often a process. I have no objection to the Minister, the chief executive or the Welsh Minister as the case may be specifying, but the document that they put that in is more easily referred to as a register. Of course, one could pick that up in the reference that we discussed under my earlier amendment, which would be a very elegant solution.</p>

The Bill is already infamously long and convoluted. The use of the word &#147;specification&#148; in Clause 21, therefore, when the term is not defined until much later, seems to add a further layer of unnecessary complexity. I hope that the Minister will consider my noble friend&#146;s amendments favourably. The Bill will benefit from the close and dedicated scrutiny that my noble friend brings to it.</p>

I thank the noble Lord, Lord Elton, for introducing it and enabling us to have this discussion. It allows me to make a point about the reading of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09062475000170"></a>Throughout our deliberations so far in Committee, I have been impressed by noble Lords&#146; expectations about what they expect to understand from the drafting of a Bill. When you are wading through a Bill, as many noble Lords will know, piecing together its meaning is very difficult. Sometimes we have to go through the detail in Committee to flush these things out and share them with the House. When you read a Bill, you also have to read in previous pieces of legislation, so I understand noble Lords&#146; frustrations with the complexity of the drafting and the length of the Bill. I feel very strongly that we on the Government Benches must work harder to ensure that noble Lords have satisfaction as far as the interpretation is concerned.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09062475000171"></a>Having said that, I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Elton, has made his case with customary verve, eloquence and precision, and I share his desire to ensure that our legislation, even when dealing with complex matters, is written in as plain, accessible and understandable language as possible and that the drafting is precise.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09062475000172"></a>The <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I> definition of &#147;specification&#148; is the,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09062475000257"></a>&#147;Specific, explicit, or detailed mention, enumeration, or statement <I>of</I> something&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062475000240"></a>Allowing for some flexibility in certain areas is essentially the role of the <I>S</I><I>pecification of </I><I>A</I><I>pprenticeship </I><I>S</I><I>tandards for England</I> and its sister document in Wales.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09062475000173"></a>As a Whip, I once told a Minister off for waving exhibits around, so I will probably get told off in a minute, but I have in my hand the specification document that has been circulated for consultation. It will set out the standards that all apprenticeships must meet. Although the noble Lord, Lord Elton, has made a tempting case for the title &#147;register&#148;, as he will be aware, our consultation on the draft <I>S</I><I>pecification of </I><I>A</I><I>pprenticeship </I><I>S</I><I>tandards for England</I> has recently closed. We have received 400 responses. During that process, the term &#147;specification&#148;, or SASE for short, has become widely used. It is a familiar term to those who have been involved in the consultation, who are clear about what it means.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09062475000174"></a>I would be reluctant, because of that, to lose that meaning at this stage, or to risk confusing employers, colleagues, colleges and others around the country by changing the name now, particularly when the arguments for the choice of name perhaps are a bit finely balanced. I have listened to what noble Lords have to say. The document has a life now, and I hope that with that recognition, the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

Amendment 38A would ensure that when preparing the drafts, the Secretary of State must consult not the persons who he thinks are appropriate, but more specifically the representatives of industry, employers, sector skills councils, sectoral bodies, the further education sector and other persons the chief executive considers appropriate. Amendment 40 would ensure that the chief executive of skills funding is required to consult employers regarding the self-specification and self-assessment parts of any apprenticeship scheme that employers provide themselves.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09062475000177"></a>This is in order to provide flexibility, responsiveness to employer needs, and to ensure that standards are constantly driven up. Amendment 42 requires that this process of consultation with employers, representatives of industry, sector skills councils and any other person who the Skills Funding Agency considers appropriate, starts with the first draft specification. The Bill as it stands specifies that the chief executive does not need even to consult such persons as the chief executive considers appropriate on the first draft. Can the Minister confirm that this is because extensive consultation has already been carried out on the first draft? Otherwise, I cannot understand the reasoning.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09062475000178"></a>Amendment 48 is consequential on these provisions and requires that representatives of industry, employers, sector skills councils and the further education sector must also be consulted if any draft modifications to the specification of apprenticeship standards for England are to be introduced. Amendment 173 requires that the person to whom the chief executive has delegated powers in order to carry out apprenticeship functions must also be responsive to employers&#146; needs with regard to the provision of apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09062475000179"></a>We have tabled these amendments because it seems inappropriate that the Bill does not require stronger employer involvement when the draft specifications of apprenticeship standards are being drawn up. It is simply good sense to make sure that employers are involved in the process from the very beginning. This would have a twofold advantage. First, it would mean that employers, and those representing employers, would be able to specify standards that were appropriate to them. Secondly, it would mean that standards would not then constantly have to be revisited in response to the concerns of those employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09062475000180"></a>Important groups speaking for employers have voiced their concerns in this area, and it is vital that we take their views on board. The CBI recognised that the Government&#146;s intentions are,</p>
<ul><a name="09062475000267"></a>&#147;to raise both the quantity and quality of apprenticeships&#148;&#151;</ul><ul><a name="09062475000268"></a>but it strongly recommends that&#151;</ul><ul><a name="09062475000269"></a>&#147;encouraging strong employer involvement and ensuring the programme better meets the need of businesses, is the key to both increasing the number of places on offer and raising training quality&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062475000270"></a>John Lucas of the British Chambers of Commerce also stated that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09062475000259"></a>&#147;We think that apprenticeships need to be employer-led and employer-focused&#148;.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09062475000181"></a>As the Bill stands, I fear that there is not a strong enough emphasis on the importance of employer input. Even the <I>New Statesman</I>&#151;that great organ of the left&#151;acknowledged this in an article in its edition of 8 June, entitled &#147;The Art of Vocation&#148;, in which it states approvingly, among other things,</p>
<ul><a name="09062475000271"></a>&#147;in Germany employers drive apprenticeships, not the state&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90624-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09062475000182"></a>Furthermore, our amendments take note of the importance of consultation with the sector skills councils. They are an important intermediary and we consider them well able to represent the needs of the industry. We would therefore strongly urge that their views are taken into account.</p>

<a name="90624-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09062475000183"></a>At Report stage in another place the Minister accepted my honourable friend John Hayes&#146; arguments for clarity in the inclusion of employer bodies in co-operation arrangements. We are grateful for this concession and the new duty on colleges to follow statutory guidance from the Secretary of State on co-operation, including with employers. That is a welcome concession indeed. Nevertheless, our fears are not yet adequately allayed and we would welcome a further statutory duty which included sector skills councils. We would like to see them incorporated into the Bill so that employers are fully represented and this two-way engagement can make apprenticeship standards higher and of even more value. I beg to move.</p>

In my experience many amendments tabled by opposition parties are asking for things to be on the face of the Bill which Ministers assure us are there in intention and do not need to be on the face of the Bill. It would be very nice to say that this Bill, which as the Minister said earlier is quite difficult to follow and quite difficult to understand, nevertheless has some clear clarion principles which people can read and understand on the face of the Bill, and I think that one of them ought to be the involvement of employers, as in Germany where the apprenticeship scheme is entirely employer-led.</p>

I think that we will be having this debate throughout our consideration of the Bill. He recognises the appropriateness of the councils and their status as defined by government, and it is crucial to bear that in mind when building them back in, but I still think that we will be having this discussion over and over again. We have raised the issue several times but I seriously wonder what the Minister is worrying about. He has given an explanation before. We are not looking for specific names for sector skills councils but for a collective, generic name. The important thing is not whether they are restructured or their numbers reduced; the important thing is to recognise their value, which the Government do, as well as their role. It would be helpful if we could quickly reach a real understanding of where the councils fit in under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09062475000188"></a>The fact is that the employers will lead this country out of the economic situation that we are in. One of the things that all of them are faced with is the problem of skills shortages. It is therefore highly important that everything should be done to identify where those skills shortages may be and to make certain that they are filled by those who have the relevant training and skills to fill them. It is therefore no good leaving aside the decision as to which apprenticeships are going to be available. All of us are aware that, despite the wish and intention to have all people of this age able to get an apprenticeship, the fact is that there will not be enough apprenticeships available for all those on the market. It is therefore essential that those that are filled are filled in a way that is relevant to the future, which must be the employers&#146; future. Merely mentioning it in the context of something is not good enough, so I hope that the Minister will agree to put employers in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09062475000189"></a>I would like to raise one other small aspect of this because I could not see another opportunity of doing so. There is already one apprenticeship scheme in Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service, run by Toyota, in Her Majesty&#146;s young offender institution at Aylesbury. Unfortunately, we have in this country a number of long-term young prisoners, but they do not lack ability. It is therefore absolutely essential that their future and ability to contribute to the life of the nation should be  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1607"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1607</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>considered as well. I therefore hope that, in deciding where the resources will go, the Prison Service will not be left out.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09062475000190"></a>In that connection, I once had an interesting long conversation with the managing director of Leyland Trucks at Preston, who told me that he had had a skills shortage. One way he found of getting over it was to go to the prison to identify those who had the necessary ability and start training them so that they came out not just with a job to go to, but a job with a future. That was thinking ahead, but was of course only possible if the prisoners themselves lived in Preston; he could not do it for someone who came from Cornwall. I suggest that if you look at that right across the country, you will find that employers everywhere will be able to engage in that sort of process if they are dealing with their own. That of course brings me back to the point that employers are looking for their own in their own area with the right abilities. That is why it is so essential that it should be included in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09062475000192"></a>I pick up on her point. It is of course true that the sector skills councils are employer-led, and have been created expressly in order to be able to co-ordinate activities within each trade and sector of the employers. This is one of the reasons why, in the earlier debate about sector skills councils, I was so anxious to see that they were consulted. I felt that, having created them to express the will of employers, it was important, as I said, that we give them the courtesy of consulting them on these occasions.</p>

<p><a name="09062475000241"></a>It is always tempting to put in a long list of all those that the chief executive should think appropriate. Equally, the point of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, is there: the CBI and the employers have been lobbying us all, saying, &#147;Our voice must be heard&#148;. There is a felling that we are creating this bureaucracy, and the employers will be carried along by it and not really be able to make their point on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09062475000194"></a>There has been extensive consultation on the apprenticeship specification. One of my responses to the employers was, &#147;Have you replied?&#148;. They have, and that is one reason why the Government had 400 responses. However, it is important that, since we want the system to be employer-led&#151;and nobody disputes that&#151;they are given the courtesy of being involved in the consultation.</p>

We unreservedly share that commitment to ensuring that all who have an interest in apprenticeships have a say in developing the standards  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1608"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1608</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that will deliver the highest quality apprenticeships for our learners and employers. That is why we have just completed a full-scale, 12-week public consultation on the specification of apprenticeship standards for England&#151;the SASE&#151;which drew almost 400 responses. It was not some kind of fictitious veneer of process. It was a genuine consultative process, which embraced a wide range of employers. If it had not, it would be irrelevant. They are the people who will provide apprenticeships. Unless they are convinced that the standards that we are setting are both necessary and relevant, we will not get their co-operation. The consultation included not only employers but the HE and FE sectors, training providers, sector skills councils, trade unions, and at least one apprentice who responded.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09062475000196"></a>I was interested in the comment that was made in relation to Germany. I agree. I wish that British employers had the same attitude as German employers. We would be in a slightly different situation, but we are where we are. Where I part company is over the idea that, somehow, in the UK, it is not employers who are driving the design of apprenticeships. They most certainly are and we cannot arrive at an apprenticeship framework without the co-operation and collaboration of employers; it would be impossible. The system may not be perfect and is capable of improvement, but it is driven by employers.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09062475000197"></a>I have also met representatives of the CBI, the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils, the Association of Training Providers, the Association of Colleges, representative employers from the LSC&#146;s national employer service and other organisations to hear their views on the specifications and standards. As always, I found meeting employers an enlightening and important experience. I am not theorising about what I think employers&#146; requirements for apprenticeships are; I hear their concerns and needs directly. I give an absolute assurance that we will take careful account of all the views expressed as we finalise the SASE, and then issue it formally by order.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09062475000198"></a>At this point I will address the concerns that have been expressed about the importance of employers in this process, which was raised by several noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, drew our attention to the part of the clause that refers to the Secretary of State designating those whom he thinks appropriate. We will take that point away and see whether we can address it.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09062475000199"></a>Like Amendment 41, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, which we will come to in a moment, Amendment 42 would require further consultation on the same document. I hope that the noble Lords will accept that this is unnecessary. Both the requirement in the Bill and the very wide consultation that has already taken place demonstrate our commitment to the widest possible consultation. Should we need, at some time in the future, to modify the SASE&#151;say, as a result of the changing needs of sectors and their employers&#151;we will expect the chief executive of skills funding to undertake similarly wide consultation before the modified version of the SASE is put to Parliament for scrutiny. In anticipating the passing of the legislation  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1609"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1609</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and having had a consultative process, we have tried to ensure that we can launch these new standards as speedily as possible. If we introduce another consultative round, that will delay the introduction. We talked about speeding up the approval process, so delaying the introduction will not help the situation.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09062475000200"></a>Where consultation with persons likely to be affected by a decision or policy is required, the Government&#146;s code of practice on consultation recommends that consultations will normally last for a minimum of three months. That is the very least that Parliament would expect, and I am sure that noble Lords on the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee would be quick to draw it to the attention of the House if no such consultation had been undertaken. I know that some noble Lords may have concerns that we are somehow diminishing the role of sector skills councils. I have said repeatedly that nothing could be further from the truth. They are key to a successful apprenticeship strategy. As I have already made clear, sector skills councils will, together with their key partners, have an absolutely central role through their responsibility for developing and issuing apprenticeship frameworks.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09062475000201"></a>We recognise fully the need to have employers on board; they are central to apprenticeships. If we do not carry employers with us, as I said, they will vote with their feet and not take on any apprentices. To that extent it is self-evident that they must be consulted and so must other key stakeholders. That is one of the reasons why the National Apprenticeship Service has established a key stakeholder forum.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09062475000202"></a>In addressing the heartfelt plea of my noble friend Lady Wall, who asked us to reconsider having sectors skills councils on the face of Bill, my current information is that there is a real danger that by doing so we would introduce a hybrid nature into the Bill that would make it an even more complex and lengthy procedure. Given the concern expressed by all noble Lords who have contributed, we will take away that question of the sector skills councils to establish beyond any doubt whether there is an impediment to putting them in the Bill. I give my noble friend that assurance, although I cannot say what the outcome will be. Obviously, we take it seriously and do not want to introduce an unnecessary difference between us about the role of sector skills councils.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09062475000203"></a>My honourable friend, the Minister responsible for further education, made it clear in another place that the key stakeholder forum will include strong employer, as well as union and training provider representation. The group includes the following employer bodies: the Confederation of British Industry, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce&#151;already referred to in this debate&#151;and the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils. It&#151;the key stakeholder forum&#151;will also ensure that the views of colleges, other providers and other interested parties are heard. The Association of Learning Providers, the Association of Colleges, the Local Government Association and the Trades Union Congress, will be consulted and will help inform the development of apprenticeships. The stakeholder forum also has representation from the National Learner Panel to represent the interests of learners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09062475000204"></a>We believe that the National Apprenticeship Service stakeholder group will provide a mechanism to ensure that the views of employers as well as those of their representatives and sector skills councils are taken into account in apprenticeships and that the chief executive of the NAS will be responsive to the needs of employers in the provision of high-quality apprenticeships. That said, I understand the strength of feeling on this issue. While I do not think that any of the amendments would quite work as drafted, I would like to give the matter further consideration before we come back on Report and continue the dialogue with noble Lords about how we can ensure that the Bill reflects the strong views on all sides that the requirement for consultation with employers and their representatives could be made more explicit.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09062475000205"></a>Before concluding, I shall respond to a couple of points made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, about access to apprenticeships for young offenders. They can train against apprenticeship frameworks while in custody, but they clearly will not have an entitlement under the apprenticeship scheme as they cannot be available for work within the agreement. The important point made by the noble Lord about getting young offenders prepared and ready for apprenticeship and work is vital and we concur with it.</p>

I also thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Wall and Lady Sharp, for their contributions. I am unsurprised by the Minister&#146;s response. He is of course right about the central theme of these amendments being the involvement of employers, and I am grateful to him at least for saying that he will think further about the issue. For that reason, I shall not press the amendment today. I, too, would like to think further about the whole issue but I particularly want to reserve the right to return to this matter on Report.

These amendments address the same issue that caught the eye of my noble friends on my Front Bench. We are addressing the question of the preparation of the first draft specification. Seeing the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in his seat, I am reminded of the process by which the first model of anything is produced and of the great importance of taking everyone&#146;s views before it is produced.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1611"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1611</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09062475000209"></a>When I did my National Service, I was in a regiment equipped with the Centurion tank mark 1, which had a magnificent 600-horsepower Merlin Rolls-Royce engine to power it. However, people had forgotten that the tank was not always being moved around by this massive piece of machinery. It had to stay still in one place for a long time and, when you started that piece of machinery after a long time, it produced a large puff of smoke, which told the enemy where it was. Also, while you were in that place, you had to listen on your wireless to your superior officer&#151;who, if you were extremely fortunate, was someone like the noble Lord&#151;and that took electricity. In order to charge a 12-volt battery about once every four hours, you had to start the main engine, again emitting a little puff of white smoke and telling the enemy where you were. One would not want the same process to befall those who were designing the first draft that we are discussing here. I am sure that the noble Baroness will tell us the very good reasons why the requirement to consult is specifically excluded in both the English and Welsh sections of the Bill, and I look forward with great enthusiasm to hearing those reasons. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="09062475000210"></a><b><a name="90624-0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09062475000417"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank my noble friend Lord Elton for tabling these amendments and, indeed, for his lesson in armoured tactics. The credibility of the apprenticeship qualification will hang on the rigour of the specifications. If, as we agree, great care must be taken over the preparation of the draft specification of apprenticeship standards&#151;such care that the chief executive must consult such persons as he thinks fit in preparing the draft&#151;we need the Minister&#146;s help in understanding why it needs to be set out in the legislation that he does not have to consult such persons in relation to the first draft to be prepared after the commencement of the section. In our experience, the first draft, in particular, benefits from consultation with other people. Perhaps I am missing a point here, so I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09062475000211"></a>In addition to the questions that my noble friend has posed, I should like to press the Minister a little more on how often the Government anticipate that modifications might have to be made. Of course, as the business sector changes and new skills become needed, some modifications will be required, but I hope she will agree that too many modifications will be counterproductive. Not only will constant modification impose significant costs on providers, as well as cause great difficulty for teachers in keeping up with the changes, but it will also call into question the credibility of the certification. Therefore, it is very important that the Government take care to get it right the first time, and I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to give us some assurances on that.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, is absolutely right when he says that much of the credibility of the quality apprenticeship system that we have been talking about rests on the effectiveness of the consultation concerned with this document. As the noble Lord, Lord Elton, points out, this clause is extremely important going

Perhaps I can attempt to explain why a second consultation on the document <I>Specification </I><I>of</I><I> Apprenticeship Standards for England</I> and the equivalent for Wales is not necessary.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09062475000213"></a>Clause 21(2) requires the chief executive, as noble Lords are aware, to consult fully on the draft SASE. Clause 21(4), which removes this requirement in respect of the first draft, was written to reflect the fact that this consultation would already have taken place by the time the section came into force. As noble Lords are aware, we have had a draft apprenticeships Bill and we now have this Bill, so the consultation on the <I>Specification </I><I>of</I><I> Apprenticeship Standards for England</I> has closed. The amendment would require a further consultation on the first draft of the specification. The Committee will know, as we have just discussed it, that the draft specification was out for 12 weeks&#146; consultation, which ended on 29 May. The draft specification for Wales is out for a 12-week public consultation period, which will end on 17 July.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09062475000214"></a>As noble Lords are aware, we drew both consultations to the attention of key stakeholders, a number of whom have been involved in its early development. The SASE consultation attracted many responses: 34 per cent were from training providers; 14 per cent were from FE institutions; 12 per cent were from sector skills councils and standard-setting bodies; almost 10 per cent were from employers; and 2 per cent were from trade unions. As my noble friend has just explained, we have also had meetings with national employers in the apprenticeships programme, the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils and the Association of Learning Providers. I shall not reiterate what my noble friend has just said. The SASE and its Welsh sister document will be revised to take account of the consultations and will be published on a non-statutory basis this summer. Of course, noble Lords will have an opportunity to see the document in plenty of time before Report stage. That will enable the sector skills councils to work on adapting their existing frameworks to bring them into line with the SASE and its Welsh equivalent when, subject to the passage of this Bill, they come into force in 2011.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09062475000215"></a>The Bill was drafted to reflect the fact that the consultations were already taking place and the amendment would require a further round of consultation on the same document. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked how often modification would be needed. The advice that I have received tells me that it would be needed from time to time, in response to employer feedback. My view is that this is not something that would need modification frequently. Given the amount of consultation and work involved, it is important that we get it right so that we do not have to tweak it all the time. In view of these remarks, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Elton, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Both amendments are in my name and the names of the noble Baronesses, Lady Blackstone and Lady Morris of Yardley. They relate to the contents of an apprenticeship. This is such an important matter that broad standards must surely be laid down in the Bill. We propose a new clause with five subsections.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09062475000218"></a>The first subsection concerns the requirement for a specified minimum time for off-the-job learning. This is crucial for two reasons. First, an apprentice must learn why he is doing what he is doing, not just how to do it. There must be systematic learning of the knowledge that underpins the trade that the apprentice is learning. That cannot be acquired in the hurly-burly of the workplace; it requires stepping back in the company of an instructor and other students.</p>

<a name="90624-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09062475000219"></a>Secondly, we are preparing young people for a world in which often they will not continue to work in the same trade but will change their trade. Therefore, they are required to build up general skills, not ones specific to their original trade. These include functional skills in maths and English, as well as analytical habits of mind that they can acquire through their study of underpinning knowledge.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1614"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1614</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90624-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09062475000220"></a>This is very important when we make international comparisons. At 15, our children have functional skills that are as good as those of French and German children but, by the age of 20, they are way behind. We are not paying enough attention to their development between the ages of 15 and 20. That has to change. Again, this requires a standing back from the workplace.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90624-0007.htm"/>


<a name="90624-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09062475000221"></a>The first new subsection proposed by Amendment 59 repeats the corresponding provision in the draft specification of apprenticeship standards but takes away the brackets from &#147;250 hours&#148;, as suggested in the draft specification, and adopts this number as the standard. This corresponds to the concept of day release, or its equivalent, which is already strongly associated in most people&#146;s minds with a serious apprenticeship. There is nothing new about this; it simply reaffirms what people think an apprenticeship should be. However, we have added a line and a half at the end of proposed new subsection (1), allowing some of these guided learning hours to be satisfied when a student receives new material online at his or her work station. We have included this as a concession to employers who are worried about the rigidity of the specification for the hours of off-the-job guided learning.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09062475000222"></a>Many employers are doubtful about this proposal. Individual employers do not necessarily understand that the aim of the operation is that, in return for the money that taxpayers are spending on apprenticeships, the employer accepts that the apprenticeship is providing not just specific training but general training in the interests of the apprentice and of the economy as a whole, because it adds to the flexibility of the workforce.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09062475000223"></a>It is important that the Government should stand up for what they proposed in the specification. To make sure that it survives in years to come, it should be put in the Bill. There is a great deal at stake here and without this subsection of our amendment there is no robust guarantee that apprenticeship will be a truly educational experience or that we will, at long last, have in this country the truly educated workforce that the Bill is supposed to produce. It is vital that this provision should be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09062475000224"></a>Subsection (2) has the same objective as subsection (1), but focuses on the qualification. At present, most apprenticeship frameworks have separate evaluation of the on-the-job training via the NVQ and of the off-the-job underpinning knowledge via the technical certificate. This is a well established brand and is how apprenticeship has been for most of our lifetimes: a mixture of an off-the-job technical certificate with on-the-job learning. This brand was endorsed in 2001 by the Cassels committee, of which I was a member, and we should stick to it. However, the draft specification now opens up the possibility that the NVQ and the technical certificate could be merged, although it insists that there should be distinct units of knowledge within each qualification. That is a slippery slope because the most likely purpose of the merger is to diminish the knowledge content required. If we want to sustain the analytical content of the apprenticeship, we should insist that the knowledge component normally comes via a separate qualification, the technical certificate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09062475000225"></a>Subsection (3) relates to functional skills in the level 2 apprenticeship. In the draft specification, there is a funny situation because as it stands there is no reason why most apprentices should study functional skills at all during their apprenticeship. The specification states that, to complete an apprenticeship, the person has to have at the end of it level 1 qualifications in maths and English&#151;that means a pass at any level at GCSE&#151;but most students will already have those qualifications when they enter the apprenticeship. If we are serious about wanting people to improve their literacy and numeracy during their apprenticeship, it is essential that the qualifications in functional skills required to complete it are higher than the level 1 with which most people enter. However, it is also true that level 2 is a stiff hurdle to insist that they all jump because it is equal to grades A to C at GCSE. We suggest that there should be a level halfway between as one of the required components for completing an apprenticeship.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09062475000226"></a>Subsection (4) would put in statute what is already in the draft specification. It relates to functional skills at the next level, the advanced apprenticeship. That is fine, but let us have it in the Bill. Subsection (5) is simply a statement about good practice. Good apprenticeships already include continuous mentoring, but there are apprenticeships that do not and they should have to fall into line.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09062475000227"></a>I apologise for the length of these remarks, but I think that the broad content of an apprenticeship is too important to be left to regulations. I urge the Minister to consider including our amendments in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

It helps to ensure that the apprentice obtains a firm grasp of the underpinning knowledge needed to develop the relevant technical skills, that they develop an understanding of the sector in which they work and that they have time to review progress and reflect on what they have learnt. There is no doubt that a combination of both on-the-job and off-the-job learning is desirable. As we have argued in our party&#146;s Green Paper, there is a need both for job-specific skills to be taught via training in the workplace and for broad transferable skills that can be taught in the classroom.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09062497000002"></a>In that sense, we support the premise of the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Layard, particularly on the provision of training to improve functional literacy and numeracy, as he says. However, our position is that, because there is significant and necessary variation between industry sectors in the amount of underpinning knowledge, theory and understanding that apprentices need before they are fully competent and qualified to carry out their respective jobs, we believe that specifying a minimum number of hours for each apprenticeship framework is a step too far&#151;hence our Amendment 58A, which specifies the opposite.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09062497000003"></a>The criteria laid out in Amendment 59 might prove too onerous for some employers who would otherwise desire to run an apprenticeship scheme. That view is shared by the CBI, which states unequivocally that the flexibility of the employer should not be lost in a maze  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1616"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1616</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of new rules and regulations. It may be the Government&#146;s opinion that a rigid system of apprenticeship standards will increase quality, but the reality of such restrictive regulations is a minimum amount of guided learning hours at a location other than the workplace, which could hamper employer involvement.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09062497000004"></a>Such regulation does not take into account the varied nature of apprenticeships. One industry will evidently require different levels of off-the-job training from another and an apprentice&#146;s age and individual needs must also be considered. For some sectors and businesses, notably the more traditional apprenticeship sectors such as engineering, a significant part of apprentices&#146; training will take place off the job. For others, most training will be more effectively taken on the job. A 2007 survey by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills showed wide variation in the quantity of off-the-job training required. For example, 70 per cent of engineering apprentices&#146; time is spent in off-the-job learning in comparison with 46 per cent for the construction sector and 38 per cent for the retail sector.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09062497000005"></a>Most important, employer involvement itself is the key part of any successful apprenticeship programme. As your Lordships&#146; Economic Affairs Committee highlighted, completion rates improve when the apprenticeship programme is linked to strong employer involvement, rather than when an employer is,</p>
<ul><a name="09062497000100"></a>&#147;marginalised at the end of a long chain of administration&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062497000090"></a>If the Government seek to increase the number of apprenticeship bases offered by employers, more must be done to ensure that the programme meets business needs, particularly given the current economic climate when training budgets are under pressure. One can only imagine the frustration on the part of both the employer and the apprentice in a sector where a specified minimum time exceeds the time actually needed for off-the-job training. The introduction of a minimum period of off-the-job training would, we suggest, stifle flexibility for companies to adapt training programmes to meet their business and their employees&#146; needs and mean that fewer firms would see value in becoming involved.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09062497000006"></a>Such a change would mark a significant departure from the Government&#146;s ambition to create a demand-led skills system. A statutory framework for apprenticeships could place burdens on firms that, during this time of financial uncertainty, might discourage their participation in apprenticeships. This would be an error and would compound the Government&#146;s record in working with businesses and SMEs to provide quality apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09062497000007"></a>This time last year, a submission to the Conservative Party from a business that undertakes an apprenticeship scheme identified nine areas of administrative burden involved in running an apprenticeship programme. Surely it would be wrong to further encumber businesses that provide apprenticeship places in this manner. Regulating for the same minimum amount of off-the-job learning for each of the 180 apprenticeship frameworks now in existence could seriously damage the attractiveness of the programme to many employers.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09062497000008"></a>On a different note, there is a concern that these amendments could have a negative impact on the participation in apprenticeships of people with learning

The Alliance for Inclusive Education has argued that this sort of requirement could risk precluding young people with learning difficulties from entering apprenticeship schemes. We suggest that that prescriptive approach is not justified, given the existence now of apprenticeship schemes such as the Tesco level 2 retail scheme, which currently makes no such demands and is thus open to young people with learning disabilities. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reassurances on this matter.</p>

Subsection (2) of the proposed new clause suggests that the,</p>
<ul><a name="09062497000101"></a>&#147;framework must normally specify two separate qualifications&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062497000091"></a>At the end of their training, apprentices are very proud of the qualifications that they receive, which are acknowledged by employers as involving work that includes both on-the-job and off-the-job training. That suggestion would complicate things and may even devalue one of the qualifications. I also question the wisdom of subsection (3) of the proposed new clause. Hard work has been done to get NVQs the credibility that they have. To suggest that there should be a halfway house between level 1 and level 2 would devalue both levels. Some students have a hard struggle to achieve either of those levels, but they then know the value of them. Where do we start defining what should be level 1 or level 2 and what might or might not fit? From my point of view, that would be a disastrous road to go down.</p>

I am reassured by the words of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, that he supports off-the-job training because we on these Benches are very much with the noble Lord, Lord Layard, in the notion that an apprenticeship includes not only training on the job but also an element of off-the-job training and that it is a continuing process of education. As the noble Lord rightly points out, if people move into an apprenticeship at the age of 16 and we want to increase the learning leaving age to 18, it is appropriate that there should be some continuing process of education within that. As we all know, in the current framework, quite often the off-the-job element is delivered within a college of further education. The concept of key skills has been very important within the framework. Sadly, rates of achievement in key skills have often been very low, but they have been rising considerably and a lot of emphasis is being put on this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09062497000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Layard, is probably the person whom I should ask this question.

I do not find difficulty in accepting the notion of seven hours a week, 40 weeks a year, or something equivalent, but I have difficulty in understanding what the words &#147;off the work station&#148; mean. Helpfully, the noble Lord, Lord Layard, has spelt out in his amendment what he thinks it means, but as far as I can see it could mean that you go to a company training room, rather than sitting right beside the machine that you are working with.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09062497000014"></a>Equally, there are occasions when, frankly, you need to be at your work station for training rather than away from it, such as for health and safety training. There has to be some flexibility in the way in which we consider training. Yesterday I was talking with people from the building industry, the core of whom were roofing contractors. A lot of separate skills are involved in the building industry&#151;plastering, tiling and so on&#151;and the training, particularly the tool training, of people needs to take place at the work station. I rather mirror the thoughts of the noble Baroness, Lady Wall: we are with the noble Lord, Lord Layard, in regard to the general concept of off-the-job training and off-the-work-station training, but there has to be some element of flexibility to reflect the circumstances of particular trades.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09062497000018"></a>I shall go through the five subsections of the proposed new clause but, before I do so, I wish to underline what my noble friend said. This goes to the heart of the Bill&#151;at least the apprenticeship section of it. Unless we can secure high standards and high-quality apprenticeships, all our work in this House and in  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1619"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1619</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>another place, and all the work that employers are doing, will be wasted. It is absolutely essential that apprenticeships are held in high regard by the young people who take them, by the other areas of the education system to which they might progress and by all employers. Unless we establish in the Bill that there are to be high standards and good quality, none of those things will happen. I make a plea to my noble friends the Ministers to take this seriously. Even if there are details in what is proposed that they may wish to modify or amend, I hope that they will accept the principle behind it.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09062497000019"></a>I was a little surprised by what the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, said on 250 guided learning hours. I am delighted that the Conservative Front Bench supports the principle that an apprenticeship framework should be of a higher standard, that there should be a technical element in the qualification and that basic skills are important, but there is some inconsistency in the noble Lord&#146;s commitment to those things and his suggestion that 250 hours of guided learning are not necessary. I do not understand how one can achieve that higher level of key skills in a young person, and a growth and development in their knowledge, without taking them off their particular daily tasks and teaching them in order to help them to develop in this way.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09062497000020"></a>Day release is not a particularly new concept, as my noble friend said: it goes right back to the 1918 Act. It should not be enormously revolutionary for the employers who are taking part. Perhaps I may speak with my employer&#146;s hat on for a moment. We are considering taking on some apprentices. However, I know perfectly well that wherever the apprentices go to work in the university that I run&#151;helping in an office, helping a group of people responsible for security or helping with the transport that we provide, for example&#151;they will not acquire that knowledge and those basic skills if they spend all their day in the workplace just being given some guidance. They will need that guidance, of course, but we will not achieve the quality that we want.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09062497000021"></a>Perhaps I may pick up one other point made by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. There is of course a wide variety of apprenticeships. The amendments would merely establish a basic level. There may be some more demanding areas where the time off work needs to be greater&#151;all the percentages that the Minister specified represented far more time off and away from the workplace for guided learning than the seven hours per week, 40 weeks a year that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, referred to. There is therefore room for flexibility, as there should be, but it is the basic minimum that we are trying to establish here. It is surprising that the CBI should have taken the position that it has. I often want to support what the CBI says, but I do not in this respect. Responsible employers will see this rather differently.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09062497000022"></a>The second issue is whether an element of the qualification should be concerned with knowledge and competence. I say to my noble friend Lady Wall that I have no problem if it is a single certificate; all that I am asking is that there should be a technical as well as a skills component, because otherwise we will not have the quality that I referred to earlier. That  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1620"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1620</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>must be specified in the Bill. It would be better if the young apprentice went away saying, &#147;I&#146;ve got this technical certificate which I can take to another employer and I&#146;ve got this certificate which is all about my skills&#148;.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09062497000023"></a>I think that every employer in the country would say that far too many young people and adults do not have decent basic skills&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Moser, spoke about this at Second Reading. Their skills are sometimes so low that they can barely function in any job that makes any demands on them. It is of fundamental importance that every young person should continue. As a university vice-chancellor, I can say that many young people who even get as far as university do not have basic skills at the level that they should have. I therefore believe that we owe it to young people who are going through the apprenticeship system to help them in this way. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will agree with the proposal and support it and that he will accept that we need to specify this in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09062497000024"></a>Again, I was a little surprised by what the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, said about young people with learning difficulties, arguing that this would put them off. Young people with learning difficulties in particular need to be helped with these basic skills so that they can operate effectively not just at work but in their lives. They need to be given even more help in this respect, not less, and I do not think that in any way they will be put off.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09062497000025"></a>On Second Reading, I mentioned the provision of a mentor. Many young people need a lot of help and support. They are not yet mature adults and many may not get a huge amount of help and support at home. They need someone who will provide them with encouragement, who will hold their hand when something is going wrong for them, who will give them a bit more confidence, who will praise them when praise is due, but who will also give them constructive criticism when needed. I do not believe that a mass system of apprenticeship will work unless we can put something of this sort in place. It should be a requirement that every employer does that. I do not believe that it would be difficult for employers to provide a mentor; they would want to have someone who takes responsibility for the young person on a day-to-day, week-by-week basis.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09062497000026"></a>I repeat that the new clause would put into the Bill a series of small changes that would bring about an apprenticeship system of which we could all be proud and that was of a standard and quality that is absolutely necessary and fundamental.</p>

The provision is even more important because we are dealing with a group of young people who until now have not been required to stay at school until 18. That is quite a change in their lives. I would hope for the maximum flexibility in dealing with those aged 16 to 18.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09062497000028"></a>I take the same line as the noble Baroness, Lady Wall, in that I would think it a pity if one had to lay down a certain number of guided learning hours. I

However, I am more concerned about the apprenticeship framework and the intention to move from level 1 to level 11/2, as it were. That could have problems for those with learning difficulties. I am more for encouraging people to move slowly up to this level, but one does not want to put them off.</p>

<a name="90624-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09062497000029"></a>Thirdly, a mentor is crucial because this is a new situation. You are dealing with something that the vast majority of these young people will not want to do anyhow&#151;that is, stay on at school. As we heard in Question Time, a number of young people of this age are already out of school and we have the terrifying task of trying to get them back into the educational system. I have a lot of sympathy with both points of view, but the ideas behind the amendment are important. I hope therefore that they will be taken away by the Minister and that on Report he will come back with an amendment that will be easier for us all to agree with.</p>

Where differences occur is, perhaps, in the degree of rigidity in the frameworks that should be specified; I have a great deal of sympathy with amendments from my own Front Bench asking for a certain amount of flexibility in the number of hours. It is fine to lay down a minimum number, but there should be flexibility beyond that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09062497000031"></a>I feel some considerable surprise about the second paragraph of subsection (1) of Amendment 59, which says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09062497000102"></a>&#147;periods of study ... may not include periods of private, unsupervised study&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062497000092"></a>I am particularly surprised at this coming from the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, who has so much experience in education. It is surely absolutely acceptable for apprentices to be set a specific assignment, which they will do as private, unsupervised study, provided that the assignment that is produced is of sufficient quality and is on time. It is very important that young people between 16 and 19 learn to study privately, in an unsupervised way; it is one of the skills that they will carry through life. Provided that they are doing it in a guided way, with an assignment expected&#151;</p>

Part of the number of hours that count should be the hours that pupils spend conducting their own study and direction of research or learning, as they do at university level, for people of 19 to 22,

That is a very important part of the skills that they learn. I would be very sorry if this proposal were incorporated into the Bill.</p>

<a name="09062497000034"></a><b><a name="90624-0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09062497000122"></a>Lord Elton:</b> The last two noble Baronesses said everything that I was going to say. I just wish to endorse what they have said.</p>

<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="09062497000035"></a><b><a name="90624-0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09062497000123"></a>Lord Baker of Dorking:</b> I have great sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Layard, is trying to achieve by this. When someone becomes an apprentice at 16, he should not be expected to spend his life just in the training part of it, acquiring the skills in engineering or the skills he would learn in apprenticeship in, say, the building trade. He must have a more rounded education, particularly in English and maths and, I would imagine, IT. For any young apprentice, whatever they are studying&#151;and this comes back to the point about technical skills that the noble Baroness made&#151;IT should be included.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09062497000036"></a>The dilemma that the noble Lord is trying to answer is the one at the heart of the Government&#146;s policy of extending education to 18. What do you do with 14 to 18 year-olds? That is really the dilemma. I happen to be a very strong believer in the 14 to 19 curriculum&#151;and I speak as one of the authors of the national curriculum. The Government were right to identify the 14 to 19 curriculum four or five years ago, with Sir Michael Tomlinson. It has taken a long time to get to it, but the instrument for delivering it will be the diplomas. The Government are starting out on that course this year. The problem is that a youngster who becomes an apprentice at 16 need not have any institutional framework at all; he leaves school and just becomes an apprentice. There is no institutional framework for him to go to, unless he happens to enrol himself at a local FE college or his employer says that he should.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09062497000037"></a>Therefore, to deliver the 14 to 19 curriculum and obtain to a large extent the ends sought by the noble Lord, Lord Layard, you need new institutions. You need 14 to 19 technical colleges. Before Lord Dearing died, he and I were pioneering those with the full support of the Government, I am glad to say. We got one off the ground, with a few more about to be announced, we hope. The idea is that youngsters can be recruited at 14 as young apprentices. Half the intake will be young apprentices. Because they are still at a school, the young apprentices will still do GCSEs in English, maths, science and IT, and possibly a diploma. They could do a mixture of English, maths and a diploma. The diploma counts as three GCSEs. The point is that even the young apprentices would get that rounded experience from 14 to 16.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09062497000038"></a>If they are still part of the institution, as they are expected to be at 16, they have an anchor&#151;the institution&#151;to come back to. As that institution is backed by a university or FE college, they also have its prestigious help and advice. My point is that by coming back to an institution&#151;to a university technical college&#151;they would have a framework around them to encourage them to have exactly the sort of rounded education that the noble Lord is talking about, with which we all agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09062497000039"></a>I hope that we will be able to establish more of these colleges. They are, of course, experimental, but it is the only way that 14 to 19 education can be delivered effectively. It is one of the best solutions for telling youngsters, &#147;You are going to stay on at 16&#148;. The institutions will be technical and vocational, but youngsters will also take the subjects that the noble Lord, Lord Layard, mentioned.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09062497000040"></a>I have some sympathy with what the noble Baroness, Lady Wall, said about having half standards between NVQs. I was one of the Ministers who launched NVQs a generation ago. It has taken a bit of time to get them established over the years, but they are now and I would not bring in variations of halves and all the rest of it. I am not suggesting that the Government should commit themselves totally to what I have advocated for university technical colleges, but a solution along those lines will eventually emerge in English education and they would be very popular.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09062497000041"></a>Germany has had such colleges since 1945. Rab Butler left them. They were disbanded in the 1950s because they were infra dig, greasy rags, and everybody wanted to go to the school on the hill. But I submit to the Committee that a technical college from 14 to 19, with young apprentices and apprentices working alongside students towards foundation degrees, is the long-term solution.</p>

<a name="09062497000042"></a><b><a name="90624-0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09062497000124"></a>Baroness Blackstone:</b> On the halfway point between level 1 and level 2, which was raised by my noble friend, I would not die in a ditch for this. One way of solving the problem would be to say that any young person starting an apprenticeship who had not achieved level 1 would have to be helped to achieve level 1. That might apply to some young people with learning difficulties. All those who had achieved level 1 should be asked to try to achieve level 2. But we would have to be realistic if we went down that road. Quite a lot of young people starting on this framework would find it impossible to get to level 2. In a sense, there would be a built-in element of failure. However, as long as we allowed them to proceed to the next stage in the apprenticeship system even if they had not acquired level 2 in the basic apprenticeship, I would be willing to modify the new clause in order to take into account the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, and my noble friend Lady Wall.</p>

In terms of reaching level 2, achieving an A to C grade in English or maths GCSE is quite difficult, but we are introducing a new qualification called functional skills. Nobody quite knows yet what functional skills will involve, but to take the English element, one of the things that employers constantly complain about is that employees cannot do such things as put together a short comprehensive report, or write a business letter. I would imagine that when you are talking about English functional skills, this is precisely the sort of thing that you are going to be involved with; similarly for maths, that this would include some elementary concepts of statistics and accounting. If you are an apprentice working in this sort of area, it is extremely important to have some knowledge of  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1624"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1624</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>elementary accounts. One would hope that these functional skills are going to be perhaps more approachable for the general run of students, as opposed to the more academic maths and English GCSEs.</p>

<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="09062497000044"></a><b><a name="90624-0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09062497000126"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> I hope we will not make the mistakes we made with GCSEs, in producing a curriculum at least half of which has no relevance to at least 90 per cent of the population. I have spent my life with figures, one way or another, and when I took my sons through GCSEs, I recognised that I had never used, and could not conceive of using, about half of the curriculum. I suppose they might be used in certain specialist circumstances.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09062497000045"></a>If we are going to produce a functional skills curriculum, then let us use the flexibility we have in the system to make sure that what we are asking of an apprentice is a set of mathematics and English that has a relevance to the apprenticeship that they are doing and the career they might follow. First, that produces the motivation to get it right, and secondly, it produces a real qualification at the end of it. I do not really care if my plumber can parle Shakespeare&#151;I would be delighted if he does, it will add to the quality of his life, but it should not be a requirement of an apprenticeship, even at the advanced level.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09062497000046"></a>I support my noble friend in what he says about flexibility, but I am worried about who the guardian of this flexibility is supposed to be, if we allow it into the system. If it is entirely the employers who are running this system, and who are saying how many guided learning hours should get into an individual qualification, then the pressures on the whole are going to be all in the direction of reducing the amount of guided leaning hours, until we get to the situation we have now in universities. I would be hard put to identify more than about 10 that my daughter received in an entire three years education&#151;she was either being lectured at or reading by herself. Actual contact with academics, even at quite decent universities, has been reduced to extremely low levels. You can get lectures off a computer and you can read from a computer. The equivalent is staying at your workstation and absorbing some computer-generated learning, all of which is becoming much better designed and is working much better. That surely must be the pressure that employers will be under as apprenticeships evolve.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09062497000047"></a>If we want something other than that, what mechanism are we putting in place to make sure that there is pressure in that direction? Otherwise we get into the same problems we had with examination quality, where the pressure is all in one direction&#151;to make them gradually easier. That is why we have Ofqual in the Bill. I would like at this stage to avoid that problem by making sure that we design in pressures in the right direction. However, I do not see what the pressures are to keep the independence and quality of learning up, rather than letting it all be absorbed in direct learning at the workplace, which is, as I say, getting better and easier.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09062497000048"></a>I like the idea in subsection (2) in Amendment 59 of the two separate qualifications. This has worked extremely well for music examinations. If you get level 5 in flute, there are two level 5s&#151;level 5 practical and level 5 theory, and you can go through the whole system  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1625"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1625</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>without touching theory. One of the finalists in the BBC&#146;s conducting competition was a man who had made his career in music without being able to read it. It was a challenge to him to come up against something where he was required to learn to read music. I think he did it extremely well. There are a lot of careers for which the practical knowledge is an amplification, and is necessary to some elements of it, but is not tied in to the ability to perform it to a very high level. So I think that the separation of the two&#151;again, if done flexibly; if it is right for that particular qualification&#151;seems to have attractions and to let through particularly people with learning difficulties of all sorts of varieties who find, for one reason or another, the theoretical side hard.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09062497000049"></a>I do not know whether we still do it, but there was a moment when we suddenly insisted that you could not be a teacher of dance in a school unless you had GCSE mathematics. I have always thought that that was totally ridiculous. You just do not need maths to teach dance. It is an enhancement to your life, but it should not be a qualification. We should not, particularly when dealing with practical qualifications, build in obstacles that are irrelevant to people's eventual performance in the workplace. Yes, the economic side is an enhancement, it may enable people to reach higher. It should always be there as part of the offering and encouraged, but it should not be put in people's way in terms of getting a qualification.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09062497000050"></a>I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, on subsection (5) of the new clause. I think that it is a great help to a young person to have an individual mentor. You may end up with a nightmare of a mentor but most people adapt to this extremely well, particularly with a little training. Mentoring schemes run very well in many good schools where the older pupils mentor the younger ones. Most people are capable of it. As I say, with a little support and training in how to be a good mentor, it is something that is enormously supportive. I think that it should be built into the requirements.</p>

I shall endeavour to address all the contributions. I do so with trepidation as two former education Ministers have entered the debate in addition to my noble friend Lord Layard. I used to wake up worrying about these kinds of scenarios.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09062497000052"></a>My noble friends&#146; amendment sets out five specific requirements for the SASE. I wholeheartedly support the intention behind their amendment, which I believe seeks to establish what we all want. I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, has come back and embraced quality again, because that is what we all want. We want to protect the integrity of the brand. We want to ensure that young people are provided with relevant valuable training which not only forms the basis for the job they may currently be doing, although that  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1626"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1626</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may satisfy one group of them, but will produce a productive and successful future career. That is a common goal in what we want from apprenticeships. It really is a joy to behold when you see it working well&#151;when you see the development of young people, and some not so young people, and find them going back into learning again. There is then no holding them back. There is a real shared consensus on the objectives. I suspect that the problem will be how we get there.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09062497000053"></a>One of the difficulties is that we talk about apprenticeships as if there were just one version of an apprenticeship. There is not. My noble friend Lord Layard, whom I esteem highly, referred to serious apprenticeships, but they are all serious apprenticeships. It does not matter whether they take place in Tesco or McDonalds or at the high end of British Aerospace, they are all serious apprenticeships. They are just addressing different workplace environments. We have to remember that.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09062497000054"></a>In my remarks I want to address the genuine objectives described by my noble friends Lord Layard and Lady Blackstone and other noble Lords and pick up some of the points made. First, my noble friend Lord Layard described merged qualifications as the slippery slope. We hope that it will not be a slippery slope. Although there will be merged qualifications, I assure him and others who expressed a concern that the competence component and the knowledge component of the merged qualifications will be a separate assessment. We understand the importance of ensuring that we address both aspects of that.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09062497000055"></a>My noble friend also made a reference to functional level 1, saying that everyone has achieved it. Actually, I wish that that were the case. I was at an academy recently, and there was a stall for young people who were interested in electrical apprenticeships. I spoke to the person who was supervising it and explaining to young people what it entailed. His comment to me, out of their earshot, was that it was unfortunate that many of the young people interested in the apprenticeship had not yet met the basic standards of functional literacy and numeracy. So we are making strides, but we must not underestimate that. Many young people will need help before they can embark upon an apprenticeship, which we aim to give them. I will come back to some of the other points.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09062497000056"></a>The provisions in Part 1 are the key building blocks that will deliver an outcome of quality and relevant valuable training. But these structures need to be flexible to allow for the apprenticeship programme to develop over time. That is why, rather than dealing in the Bill with the matters referred to in the amendment, our firm intention is to deal with them through the specification of apprenticeship standards in England, or SASE.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09062497000057"></a>During the consultation on the SASE, one of the areas that attracted the most attention was the issue of guided learning hours. We have been throwing terms around rather indiscriminately in this debate. We have a requirement of 280 guided learning hours from the previous Act, when we raised the participation rate, but that merely said &#147;guided learning hours&#148; and made no reference to whether they should take place  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1627"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1627</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>either on or off the job; whereas, of course, my noble friend Lord Layard proposes a minimum of 250 guided learning hours off the workstation.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09062497000058"></a>I assure my noble friends that we are absolutely committed to ensuring that all apprenticeship frameworks contain a minimum specified number of guided learning hours. There remains debate to be had about the definition of guided learning hours and how many guided learning hours apprentices should be expected to undertake overall and away from the workstation. I commend my noble friend Lord Layard in that he was trying to be helpful in talking about, for instance, apprentices receiving new material online at their regular computer. I saw that as a helpful acknowledgement, addressing a real situation. We are currently working through the responses to the consultation on these questions, and I will certainly take careful account of the views expressed through their amendment by my noble friends in that context.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09062497000059"></a>I do not accept the inference of Amendment 58A tabled by the Conservative Front Bench that it would impose an unreasonable and inflexible burden on employers to include in the SASE a minimum requirement for off-the-job training. It would depend on the minimum. It should be a core part of any apprenticeship, and it is the minimum that anyone embarking on an apprenticeship should have a right to expect.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09062497000060"></a>I shared the noble Lord&#146;s concern about the question of too much rigidity and the important point he made when he said that we must be careful that we do not end up constructing apprenticeships where employers say, &#147;Quite frankly, it&#146;s not worth the trouble; I don&#146;t want to do it&#148;. I am as conscious of that as he is. That is why I recently met both representatives of the CBI and a wide range&#151;and I mean a wide range&#151;of employers. During that discussion, it became evident that there was no clear understanding about what we meant by &#147;off the job&#148;. When we started to explore it, there was much more receptiveness to the idea that they probably could meet a basic minimum; notice that I have not said what that should be, because we are talking through that.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09062497000061"></a>There is a balance to be struck here, and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said that he sort of hovers between the two. He feels that there is currently no requirement on employers. The vast majority of employers take this seriously. We have very few examples of employers taking on apprentices and then not honouring their obligations. Nevertheless, we have to take into account what we feel should be a reasonable set of minimum standards that could be relevant across a wide range of apprenticeships. Most of the more traditional apprenticeships that we talk about will easily meet those requirements by a mixture of day release, weekly release or online learning. I am still concerned to ensure that we do not imagine that all apprenticeships are of one kind. I stress how important this consultation is. We were there to hear their views on several issues in the consultation, but specifically on the proposals on guided learning hours. As a result of those discussions, I am confident that we will be able to reach a compromise that addresses the points raised by the contrasting amendments that we have debated today. Just as an aside, we also discussed whether ICT should form a  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1628"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1628</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>part of basic skills and there is a possibility that we might even reach an agreement on that, provided we set the right levels.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09062497000062"></a>On the second limb of my noble friends&#146; amendment, I am happy to confirm that the SASE will make it clear that all apprenticeship frameworks must contain a competence-based and a knowledge-based element. In the vast majority of instances these will be undertaken as two separate qualifications. However, it is worth noting that with the creation of the qualifications and credit framework, there will be an opportunity to simplify the existing qualifications system by including both elements in one qualification to make the system more flexible and responsive to employer need, while maintaining quality through separate assessment. The framework has been applauded by employers for giving them the kind of modular qualifications that they want. It also embraces NVQs, for which I share the enthusiasm of the noble Lord, Lord Baker. We took a long time to establish NVQs but we need to retain them.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09062497000063"></a>I am also happy to endorse the principle that apprentices should be encouraged to improve their skills in English and mathematics. Every sector requires a varying level of competence in English and maths. In many cases an apprentice&#146;s skills in these areas will develop as a natural consequence of being in the workplace on a daily basis. In other areas, more formal instruction and qualifications in English and mathematics may be more appropriate. We prefer not to be overly prescriptive. Some apprenticeships, including all at level 3, will require level 2 English and maths, for example. Requiring apprentices to pass particular exams could have the unintended effect of discouraging young people from taking up the valuable opportunities provided by apprenticeships, particularly those for whom the main attraction is to focus on gaining the sector-specific knowledge and competences that apprenticeships provide. It is about getting the balance right. It is better for the employer and the individual to decide upon the precise nature and level of English and mathematics knowledge included in the apprenticeship. Such flexibility creates opportunities for learners with learning difficulties or disabilities.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09062497000064"></a>On the fourth limb of their amendment, I can also reassure my noble friends that functional skills in English and maths at level 2 will form part of an advanced apprenticeship if the individual has not already reached that standard. I can reassure my noble friends that every apprentice should have a mentor. We propose that the prescribed terms of the apprenticeship agreement would require that the level of mentoring support is set out as part of that agreement. I can speak only from my own experience as an apprentice. Sometimes you had more than one mentor as you progressed through various parts of the business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09062497000065"></a>I want now to pick up some of the other points that were made. I have already made some reference to the question of those learners with learning difficulties and the requirement for literacy and numeracy qualifications. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, was worried that the requirement might put off some people in those circumstances. Our view is that all apprentices should be encouraged to improve functional

We are considering, with the Special Educational Consortium, the RNIB and others how frameworks can be made more accessible and meet an accessibility benchmark. We are working hard on that area.</p>

<a name="90624-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09062497000066"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, was concerned about how you would deliver targets if you do not ensure that there is sufficient flexibility for employers. There is flexibility for sector skills councils to set framework requirements in line with their employer needs, subject to meeting the specifications and standards framework, obviously. We are looking at how much flexibility can be given on guided learning. We certainly do not think that we are dumbing down progression by having only a level 1 requirement for functional skills. Level 1 is the minimum, but employers and sector skills councils have flexibility to raise that level where they deem it appropriate, depending on the demands of the framework. I have dealt with the question of merging qualifications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09062497000067"></a>This has been a very important debate. I should stress that there are two sides to the question. There are those who say beware of too much rigidity as that will have unintended consequences by deterring employers, and then there is the passionate plea from my noble friend Lord Layard, supported by others, that we must have standards that encourage people to develop so that they really will progress as a result of their apprenticeship. We are still in that consultative mode and will come back, for example, to the question of guided learning hours off the workstation. That is a genuine commitment and we have picked up the importance felt about mentoring. With those assurances, I hope that my noble friend will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09062497000069"></a>I am extremely grateful to everyone who has participated. It has been a deep debate. We have not avoided the issues; we have really gone for them, which I am sure will continue. The Minister went through all the items, and I want to comment on three of them. First, on the minimum hour item that we debated at such length, it is important to think about whether it is an arduous requirement. The old apprenticeships lasted much longer in terms of years and normally required day release and one or two evenings at night school. This is not an arduous requirement; it is an attempt to set some flaw against the total erosion of the intellectual content of the apprenticeship. It should not be thought of as hugely demanding; it is more like a flaw. It should be thought of as part of the reform of our educational system. It is a major part of the educational system for people who are not going to university, and we should be willing to stand up for the idea of a minimum. I would add that the minimum should written into the Bill. I was worried by the Minister&#146;s remarks about having it only in the standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09062497000070"></a>On the merging of qualifications, I would say that if there is one that will be separate, why merge them? That is a pretty obvious point, but if they are kept separate, they will remain brands that we know. If they are merged, we will have to relearn the system yet again and try to extract from it something that we could identify more easily otherwise. My noble friend&#146;s remarks on functional skills at level 2 apprenticeship level worried me the most. I was not quite sure whether we really are committed to ensuring that there is a serious attempt to raise the functional skills of everybody who comes in.</p>

My main reservation, which I think will probably be shared by my fellow proposers, is the idea that this will not be in the Bill. That is a very serious aspect of the Minister&#146;s reply and I think that we will have to come back to it on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

As I said, I place on the record my recognition of and appreciation for the indefatigable nature of the noble Lord&#146;s crusade to make our legislation more accessible. It is an objective that we share. At the same time, I am sure he agrees with me that there is a virtue in brevity, where we can achieve it with clarity. The Secretary of State is already granted the power to prescribe by order the form of the apprenticeship agreement under Clause 30(2)(b). As such, the amendment would introduce unnecessary duplication.</p>

I would humbly submit that, while it may be laborious to have to root through the Bill to find a particular definition&#151;we recognise that&#151;so it would be tedious for the reader to have to read time and again in the legislation that that was the case. The legislation is trying to set the general rule once, and then explain only the exceptions to that general rule in the body of the text. We believe that &#147;prescribed&#148; is defined clearly in Clause 256(1) and that that is the best way to do it.

It concerns careers guidance, an extraordinarily important issue, which many Members of the Committee raised at Second Reading. It would help to set this in the wider context. From 2013, we will have compulsory participation in education or training up to 17 and up to 18 from 2015. That is a huge task. For that compulsion to work, it is essential that students receive good information and guidance so that they make choices which work for them, otherwise we will have a very bad situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09062497000080"></a>There is the danger that schools will try to keep the maximum number of young people in school. I have heard of one school&#151;other noble Lords may have heard of others&#151;that has already told parents that the law will say that children have to stay at school until they are 18. That would be the worst possible outcome&#151;to have too many children staying on in school and then dropping out without having made sensible choices.</p>

<a name="90624-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09062497000081"></a>We are all agreed that apprenticeship must be presented to all children as a real option to be considered. However, Clause 35 does not do that. I will remind noble Lords how it sounds. The clause states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09062497000099"></a>&#147;Any consideration for the purposes of subsection (2B) of what advice would promote the best interests of the pupils concerned must include consideration of whether it would be in their best interests, or in the best interests of any of them, to receive advice which relates to apprenticeships&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062497000094"></a>The intention cannot have been to make it sound the way that I have made it sound&#151;but if noble Lords read it, they will see that it does sound like that. I understand from the Bill team that the intention was totally different from the impression given. Existing laws establish the requirement for information to be given about all routes, and this clause is meant to reinforce the requirement to give advice about apprenticeships. However, that is not the impression that is given; the impression given is that advice about apprenticeships is required only if it is in the child&#146;s best interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09062497000082"></a>I will give an example of what that can lead to. It is another extraordinary story that I heard the other day, which relates to the huge hostility in many schools towards apprenticeship. A careers service was producing documents called young person&#146;s action plans, which included a description of available options from which the young person could make their plan. Two versions of the same document were produced by the careers service. One, which was given to the young person, mentioned apprenticeship. The other, which was given to the school, did not, because the careers service was so frightened that if it was seen by the school to mention apprenticeship, the school would physically not let the service into the building to meet the young people. That is the problem that we are up against. It is no good saying that the guidance is very clear if we then put into law a clause that gives such an unsatisfactory impression.</p>

<a name="90624-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09062497000083"></a>I think that the department understands that this is not satisfactory, so I will not go on about it. However, if there is to be such a clause in the Bill, it should be self-standing; it cannot have a perhaps benevolent meaning that can be understood only by going back to something else. It must state that there should be a level playing field with regard to advice about all the possible avenues that a young person can take. I hope that the Minister will be willing to reconsider the existing clause. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90624-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09062497000085"></a>The amendments very much reflect the feeling of the House at Second Reading, when there was widespread surprise that the apprenticeships that were supposed to be so strongly supported by the Bill were effectively being written off. As the noble Lord explained, that was apparently not the intention of the Bill team&#151;but we all read the clause as suggesting that apprenticeships were not worthy of being pressed on all young people. We hope that pupils will be informed not only of the qualifications, which is the way that the noble Lord&#146;s amendment reads, but of the range of opportunities to which those qualifications lead. In some other amendments in this group, that sense is there. It is not the qualifications per se, but the opportunities that lead from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09062497000086"></a>Our amendments stress that careers information, advice and guidance would be entirely impartial and given by people who are experts on it. They would have no temptation to lean towards the sorts of qualifications that might be most readily available in the schools and colleges or&#151;perish the thought&#151;look best in league tables.

This failure is further compounded by the failure of government to provide a service that offers basic information on local labour markets, earnings, career prospects and training opportunities. A number of our witnesses expressed concern at the lack of suitable careers guidance and information for young people&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062497000095"></a>Our feeling, which I think is widespread in this Committee, is that the Bill should provide an opportunity to put that situation right.</p>

<a name="90624-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09062497000088"></a>We also suggest that careers guidance should extend beyond school leavers to well into adult life. We heard from experts from the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education. For instance, Professor Alan Tuckett, who has great authority in respect of adult education, described the Bill as a missed opportunity because it will feed through to adult learners for follow-up in careers advice and guidance. The Bill could put in place an independent, all-age career service that would work with Connexions, be accessible in schools and colleges and play a key part in promoting the value of apprenticeships by setting out the variety and rewards of skills-based employment. They are the very skills that the nation needs to be building in a competitive global society and will be in the best interests of each pupil as well as of the nation as a whole.</p>

It is a model description of what good careers education should be, with provision in every school. Clause 35 amends the 1997 Act. I am sure the Minister will say that the section in the 1997 Act that is being amended already requires information about apprenticeships to be given to all young people and that the words in the Bill are only an addition to the requirement.</p>

<a name="90624-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="090624103000002"></a>However, I point out to her that 11 noble Lords have put their names to amendments that in one way or another ask that Clause 35 repeat the requirement that information about apprenticeships should be given to all young people, not only those for whom it is in their best interests. With due respect, if 11 of us, who are used to reading the rather arcane language of parliamentary Bills have all felt the need to add this, I feel it would be important for others who will read the Bill when it becomes an Act, if it does, to understand that the requirement relates to all young people.</p>

<a name="90624-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="090624103000003"></a>Is the Minister prepared to take away the provision with the requests of several members of the Committee, including myself, to make sure that people do not have to go back to the 1997 Act to find out what is being required, but that instead the Bill will contain a clear requirement for all young people to be given information about apprenticeships? As has been said powerfully by others, if it is left to the schools, many will not mention apprenticeships, particularly to the brighter children. They will tell only those whom they feel are going to fail academically. That is not the kind of apprenticeship information that we want provided.</p>

In his subjects he hints at GCSEs and A-levels, at sixth-form colleges or sixth forms, diplomas to FE colleges or possibly sixth forms, apprentices to businesses and individual students. There should be good career guidance, as the noble Baroness, Lady Garden, said, but&#151;here I am repeating my plea for the colleges&#151;if there was a network of practical and vocational colleges for students between 14 to 19&#151;the Government support that, because I am promoting them and we are slowly getting them started&#151;that takes the trick of practical and vocational education in our society and we will support entirely the extension of the school-leaving age to 18. We should have colleges with 600 to 800 pupils taking two courses of entry, young apprentices at 14 and students, sponsored by a university where they will study the diplomas, which I strongly support. The only way in which the diplomas will effectively be delivered will be in an institution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="090624103000005"></a>If at 16 those youngsters have a sense of belonging to that institution, they will not just leave their school; it will continue. They may become an apprentice, but they will go back to their alma mater, as it were. That is not quite the right term, but the Committee will know what I mean. Practical and vocational education will be in their bloodstream and their lifestream. They will automatically know all the different routes available to them post-16. I hope that if I keep on saying this in various debates during the passage of the Bill, one Minister will say that this is a good idea and should be extended more widely, because it is the answer to most of their problems. I am happy to pioneer it by persuading universities to set up the colleges, but I am really being used by the Government as one of those people who went out in front of Roman armies to stir things up. Many of the answers to these debates will be solved by having technical vocational colleges for 14 to 19 year-olds, sponsored by universities.</p>

Noble Lords have already said why it is important, but I should like to add my voice. The Bill does not make sense in terms of consideration, and the notion that anyone should have the legal power to consider whether someone should receive factual information is not realistic in an internet world, let alone a civilised society. If we consider the opposite of that situation, with someone deciding that an individual was not entitled to receive factual information, it shows that the Bill gives an inaccurate impression.</p>

What makes sense is that we have a school system that goes from ages five to 14 and 14 to 18. I would not want it to be five to 11, 11 to 14 and 14 to 18. The Government missed a trick in abolishing key stage 3 assessment tests. They should have abolished key stage 2 and boosted key stage 3; then we could have had a strong 14 to 19 system, part of which was vocational technical colleges.

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="090624103000009"></a>We try to put into legislation factual information which children need to receive. In this debate, we have spoken a lot about the importance of the careers education service being the outside body which does not have a vested interest in children taking any one pathway and in giving them information. I support that wholeheartedly. That is the importance of the Careers Service. I am supportive of some of these amendments, although not all of them are in great detail other than the one to which I have put my name. I worry that they are not sufficient.</p>

<a name="90624-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="090624103000010"></a>There are two parts to the process of what ends up with the child; namely, the young person who receives the information and the young person who makes a decision. Receiving information is not the same as making a decision. On sex education, obesity, health and safety or whatever it may be, you can hear members of the public say, &#147;Haven&#146;t they been told about that at school?&#148;. Of course children have been told, but they have not absorbed it and it has not led them to make the decision we would wish them to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="090624103000011"></a>On the whole of this agenda, including children and young people making decisions about their future, I would like some acknowledgement that, as important as these amendments are, children and young people have a right to impartial information. The real thing that we do not do effectively is enable them to make a decision. The Careers Service essentially is one careers officer going into a school now and again to give information and then often leaving the school. Other people are left with the children and young people while they make their decisions. Schools have a vested interest in making them stay on, although we should not give inaccurate pictures of the behaviour of teachers. Most head teachers act in the interests of young people. There are parents who do not know about apprenticeships or other options and some of them do not have aspirations for their children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="090624103000012"></a>The amendment is right because it makes sense and removes the bit of Clause 35 that does not make sense. But no matter what these amendments say, we still have a job to do in moving on to the next stage of careers advice, which is, having given the factual information, how we support a child in making a decision that is in their best interest. That decision is theirs and theirs alone, and not that of the careers officer. That opens up the whole debate on aspiration, opportunity and work experience, and who will guide and mentor those children and young people. Certainly, I give my wholehearted support to the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Layard.</p>

It is not sensible to rely on two earlier pieces of legislation&#151;the 1997 Act and the 2008 Act&#151;when here we have new legislation which is specifically about apprenticeships. It needs to make it clear to those out there who are operating the system that there is a requirement to be completely impartial. I think that that is what the Government want to achieve. I do not think that there is any difference between us in terms of objectives, but the route that they are taking to get to that objective is wrong. It will not work if it is left as it is. I hate to say this, but there is an element of naivety on the part of the Government in imagining that, if this clause is left as it is, everyone who teaches in our secondary schools will be impartial. They do not have to be because they are not required to be.</p>

We think it wrong that there is a risk that the advice you receive &#147;in your best interests&#148; may depend on how ambitious your school is or on how much emphasis it places on the importance of vocational careers. All of these amendments seem to recognise this and search for a way to ensure that pupils are given the maximum amount of advice which will then allow them to make an informed choice&#151;several noble Lords have mentioned this&#151;rather than leaving them dependent on whether their careers adviser has faith in apprenticeships or, indeed, faith in the pupil being suited to the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="090624103000019"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Garden, rightly quoted from the report by your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on Economic Affairs entitled, <I>Apprenticeship: a </I><I>k</I><I>ey </I><I>r</I><I>oute to skill</I>. In 2008, a study by YouGov found that only 24 per cent of teachers agreed that apprenticeships were a good alternative to A-levels; by comparison, 55 per cent of employers and 52 per cent of young people thought so. The recipients of education and the people from whom they will need jobs once their education is finished seem to have got the idea, yet the educational profession still seems to lag behind. We need to ensure that advice about apprenticeships is given to all and that it is set in the context of a programme of training leading to a professional occupation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="090624103000021"></a>What concerns me is how to ensure that these young people get a wide enough range of information to make an informed decision. For most of this morning in the Select Committee on Communications we were taking evidence on film and television training, apprenticeships and skills and so on, and one of the things that came out clearly was how few girls are attracted to apprenticeships. Yet when we visited Pinewood, we found marvellous opportunities. Not only is it signed up to the apprenticeship schemes that are being planned on the building trades side but also there are much better opportunities for the film-makers and studios to become involved in them. That needs still to be fully worked through, because I do not think that the particular studio skills and the technical side, as well as how the acting and filming are done, would be particularly attractive to girls.</p>

I am concerned that there should be opportunities to gain a little work experience&#151;perhaps an internship.

The Government continually refer in their statutory guidance to impartial careers education as the solution to the current lack of impartiality in schools and the information that they receive. Many noble Lords have already spoken about this today, but the strength of argument needs to be reinforced.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1639"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1639</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90624-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="090624103000024"></a>Under the Education and Skills Act 2008, schools are required to provide impartial advice which promotes the best interests of pupils and to do so with regard to the guidance issued by the Secretary of State. The guidance is now out for consultation, as we heard at Second Reading. In the proposed statutory guidance there are eight principles of impartial careers guidance: being comprehensive; challenging stereotypes; helping young people to progress; being responsive to the needs of the learner; being integrated into all parts of the school curriculum; empowering the young person; raising aspirations; and encouraging young people to use external, independent sources. Apprenticeships are mentioned under the principles, &#147;comprehensive&#148;, &#147;use of external sources&#148;, including national apprenticeship vacancies and matching services, and &#147;raising aspirations&#148;. Young people should understand the benefits of FE, including apprenticeships, and all the other areas that my noble friends have spoken about today.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="090624103000025"></a>I was pleased to read the Government&#146;s careers education fact sheet and did not feel, unlike my noble friend, that it was intended to change my mind. In fact, I gave it the credence that I thought it deserved by taking each part and looking at what the Government were saying. The fact that the Government acknowledge that it has created a lot of interest underpins the concerns that many people and organisations feel and shows that it was right to raise them. The Bill does not make things clear and people are not comfortable&#151;that is probably an understatement given some of the contributions prior to my speaking.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="090624103000026"></a>The Government say that they cannot make legislation stronger because that would mean promoting apprenticeships over other options. I do not accept that. Indeed, the new apprenticeships subsection in Section 43 of the Education Act, added by this Bill, makes apprenticeship information look weaker. The Act previously stated that a school must give information that is in the best interests of the student, not of the school or of anyone else. It will now say also that, in thinking about the student&#146;s best interests, a school must consider whether they need to know about apprenticeships. That is so subjective, so unhelpful and so unequal in every way. The provision disappoints me and we should represent the weakness of it in our discussion this evening. However, it means that schools will have to think twice about what &#147;best interests&#148; means. I prefer the clear and more emphatic earlier version. The Education Act is really clear about what is in the best interests of students and that must be the driving element.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="090624103000027"></a>A worry I have is about how we ensure that the person making the decision about what is in the pupil&#146;s best interests is qualified to do so. Can we be confident about their judgment in all these areas? I accept that the fact sheet is right to say that they must be credible with students, who want advice from teachers who know them well and may know exactly what the best choice is for them. But without the regulation being more explicit in terms of factual information, will these teachers really engage with the alternatives to the academic route, especially as they are unlikely to have experienced that themselves? Not many teachers have also been apprentices.</p>

I shall therefore wind up by saying that I am sure the intention in the Bill is very different from the way in which it reads. Many people have said that. I wish that I could speak as eloquently as my noble friend Lady Morris, who said that it is not really about the information but about what schools do with it. It is about how they are supported to use it. Somehow we have to get that into the spirit of the Bill, if nothing else.</p>

It is certainly 12 and it may be a great deal more. I welcome the idea of putting the requirement for good careers advice in the Bill. I ask that in so doing all references to careers advice be deleted from other legislation so that all legislation about careers advice can be found in one place. That would not be difficult because such references do not appear in many other places in legislation. That would make life easier, generally speaking.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="090624103000030"></a>I strongly support the thinking behind these amendments, in particular those tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, to Clauses 66 and 71. However, I have a reservation. I am not at all sure that we have thought enough about the person giving the advice. The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, has pointed out that among academics a high percentage wish to retain the cream of the material in their hands for preferment through their own institution, harvesting glory for it. I suspect that from time to time the noble Baroness has herself veered a little in that direction.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="090624103000031"></a>Secondly, the way in which pupils receive the information is very important, as is their estimation of the person giving it. Being a teacher is a very risky job, because a percentage of the pupils of most teachers do not think very much of them&#151;often for not very adequate reasons and sometimes for very adequate reasons indeed. So there is a risk there. Furthermore, the careers adviser, as in the amendment tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Garden, is embedded in the school and has to be a teacher. Teachers have to be timetabled, but what these teachers will have to do will be in competition with their academic subject when the timetable is drawn up for the following academic year. If they are to do the job adequately, they must not only have time to talk to children and read the incoming flood of information about their subjects, but must have time to be in touch with their subject. That means getting outside the school altogether. I wonder whether we have taken sufficient account of the way in which outside school seems to children inside school bigger, more attractive and more grown up, and whether the professional person coming in from outside the school will have a degree of authority with the children that will enhance their value to the school.</p>

There is of course also the effect of being employed by a school, which will have some bearing. I have not come to a conclusion on this, but I hope that your Lordships will think carefully about this aspect&#151;the weight that the children will give to the person giving the advice, the knowledge that the person has about the world outside, into which, through differing channels, they will eventually go, and their skill in divining what the young people whom they are talking to think that they are saying and how it affects them. It is a highly complex and exceedingly important job.

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="090624103000036"></a>I hope that we will take the opinions expressed by your Lordships seriously. It is clear that it should not be at someone&#146;s whim whether apprenticeships are mentioned in discussions. We are aiming high with apprenticeships; we want people of excellent ability to take them. Practical ability is not confined to those people who find academic studies difficult; there are some very great practical people who get on well in academic studies. Many schools today, particularly given the way in which exams have gone, are becoming less and less practical and pupils are not exposed to that aspect as they ought to be in school, although they would be much happier and probably much more effective people later in life if they were offered the opportunity to take a practical route rather than a purely academic one. We should not confine this to the prejudices of teachers who are largely brought up in the academic route. You see that all through the education system&#151;teachers always want to be more academic rather than more practical. It is often the brighter children who attract their attention rather than those who are ordinary and whose talents perhaps lie elsewhere. We must insist on that breadth.</p>

It leads me to ask one question that may have been asked already; I apologise if it has been. It was raised by the Skills Commission and relates to the fact that so few school teachers and Connexions advisers have been out to witness apprenticeships in action. How is that being remedied? What rough percentage of school staff have gone out and witnessed what happens in apprenticeships? Perhaps the Minister would like to write to me rather than give me a response now. What aim do the Government have to improve that? What resources will be dedicated to ensuring that school staff and Connexions advisers get out to witness apprenticeship programmes at work?</p>

I have listened very carefully to all that noble Lords have said in this debate and am cognisant of the pain in disappointing my noble friends, particularly my noble friend Lady Wall when she talked about Clause 35. I very much take on board the concerns raised by noble Lords and, as they suggest, I will take this away and give it some careful consideration. I cannot emphasise too much that the concerns raised this evening are completely opposite to what we are trying to achieve. We really must do an awful lot better than we have done already.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="090624103000040"></a>I will take a few minutes to explain the Government&#146;s thinking behind the work that we have done and will specifically speak to Amendments 65, 67, 68 69 and 70A. Their intention is to ensure that schools provide information about apprenticeships and apprenticeship sectors to all pupils, alongside other post-16 options. I reassure noble Lords that existing legislation in the Education Act 1997 and the Education and Skills Act 2008, to which many noble Lords have referred, already does that. But these are new expectations being placed on schools, so their benefit will take time to come through. I understand noble Lords&#146; frustration about that. However, the expectation is that schools will provide every pupil with information about every post-16 option, and that must include apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="090624103000041"></a>I really do understand why that might not be clear from just reading the Bill, so I will explain how we got to this point, how this clause fits with existing duties around careers education and how it follows on naturally from the steps that we all took when we agreed the 2008 Act to ensure that the pupil&#146;s interests come first.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="090624103000042"></a>Section 43 of the Education Act 1997 obliged all schools to provide a programme of careers education to all pupils in years seven to 11, access to guidance and a range of up-to-date materials on careers options. But, as many noble Lords have pointed out, there was nothing to make sure that they got access to advice about all routes. There was also evidence&#151;as noble  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1643"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1643</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lords have stressed&#151;to suggest that some schools were putting their interests above those of their pupils and promoting their own learning provision.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="090624103000043"></a>The provisions in the Education and Skills Act 2008 were a direct response to that. I am glad that noble Lords still feel positive about the steps that we took in that Act. In Section 43(2)(b) of that Act, which will be very familiar to noble Lords, we imposed a duty to ensure that all information is provided impartially and that advice is given that promotes the best interests of the pupils. In fact, we even made amendments which expressly forbid schools from promoting their own interests. That was an additional step.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="090624103000044"></a>We also took powers in the Education and Skills Act 2008 to issue statutory guidance&#151;to which my noble friend Lady Wall referred&#151;on careers education, which is currently out for formal, public consultation and will be published this autumn. I will ensure that noble Lords who have not yet seen that will be able to see it by putting a copy in the Library. It sets out the core information that all young people should receive on post-16 learning options. It contains extensive information on apprenticeships, including the benefits of taking an apprenticeship, wage returns, apprenticeship sectors, progression to higher education from apprenticeship and employment opportunities available locally. This is important guidance and we hope that it will ensure that all young people get the information and advice that they need to inform their decision-making.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="090624103000045"></a>However, this is not just about the provision of information, as others have said. It is also about making sure that teachers and careers advisers are properly trained and supported to do a good job for those whom they serve. Nothing that we are doing in this Bill alters the underlying legislative position. All that we are aiming to do is to ensure that, when a school is talking to a pupil and giving them tailored advice about which option might be in their best interest, the school must have properly considered an apprenticeship as an option. That is our intention, but it is obviously not what is reading through and reaching the many more than 11 noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. The advice still has to be impartial and schools still cannot promote their own interests&#151;that is specifically prohibited under Section 43(2)(b) of the Education and Skills Act 2008. Every pupil will also be given information about what an apprenticeship is and what it can offer. We are not changing that.</p>

<a name="90624-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="090624103000046"></a>Why are we doing this? As the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families pointed out in another place, too many schools over previous years have undervalued apprenticeships. This Bill&#151;alongside the 2008 legislation&#151;should send a clear message to schools that an apprenticeship is a good route for many and cannot just be discounted when schools are considering which route might be best for pupils. Of course legislation is only part of the solution; I have heard that message and agree totally. That is why this will be underpinned by a range of other measures to secure the improvements that we seek in information and advice on all post-16 learning pathways, including apprenticeships.</p>

Our Amendment 72 would require the Secretary of State to commission a report on the quality of current careers advice, with further consideration of the appropriateness of establishing an all-age careers service in England similar to those  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1645"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1645</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We currently seem to be struggling to provide our young people with the sort of careers advice that they deserve. While the Government may legislate for a statutory right to an apprenticeship or improvements to examination standards, as we discussed before dinner, this can be undermined by a lack of effective careers advice which would direct our young people to where they would be most suited, to where their potential can be best harnessed.</p>

<a name="90624-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="090624114000002"></a>In schools in England currently around two-thirds of careers advice is delivered by teachers with no formal qualifications in this field. The noble Baroness, Lady Wall, referred to that when she spoke to the previous group of amendments. Outside schools, much of careers advice is provided by Connexions, the external agency which was set up in 2001. While we recognise the valuable service that Connexions offers in giving advice about all manner of problems, ranging from housing to careers to sexual health, we feel that that holistic range of advice may detract from a focus on careers and that the service may therefore be poorer for it. A study by the Skills Commission found that,</p>
<ul><a name="090624114000108"></a>&#147;there has been a decline in the quality of careers guidance since Connexions replaced the Careers Service&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090624114000091"></a>Given that the Government declare that their intentions are to help young people achieve their potential, does the Minister not agree that this would be a good time to institute a review of the careers advice that is on offer?</p>

<a name="90624-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="090624114000003"></a>As Keiran Gordon of Merseyside Connexions said before the committee in another place, the Bill does not go far enough to ensure that,</p>
<ul><a name="090624114000109"></a>&#147;high quality independent advice can be offered to young people&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090624114000092"></a>With that in mind, I hope the Minister will see fit to give due consideration to the second half of our amendment, which asks for an assessment of the appropriateness of adopting an all-age service as indeed already operates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90624-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="090624114000004"></a>Does the Minister agree that particularly in this time of economic crisis, it seems appropriate to have a career service that would allow truly effective and professional advice to be given to people of any age, be they starting work, unemployed, already in work or even while moving towards retirement age? This service would allow people to make truly informed choices. A universally recognised and community-based source of advice would provide reassurance both to those looking for work and those needing employees that they were getting the best service.</p>

<a name="90624-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="090624114000005"></a>We would argue that this professionalised, all-age career service should also link up to the way that advice is given within schools. While we agree with the premise of this part of the Bill which advocates that advice should be given within schools, there is a strong argument that this should not be left up to the discretion of teachers. We spoke about that before the break.</p>

<a name="90624-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="090624114000006"></a>Careers advice can have an enormous impact on the path that a student may take from school and indeed much further into life. We on these Benches would therefore argue that these students should receive the benefit of advice from an independent, dedicated,

My noble friend Lord Elton spoke about the quality of the adviser as well as the advice when he spoke to the previous group of amendments. We do not want to put the onus of the choices that these young people make on to their teachers who, without training in this specific and important field, may push people towards an apprenticeship or towards further academic study based on criteria that are in the best interests not of the pupil but of the school. So I hope very much that the Minister will give serious consideration to these proposals. I beg to move.</p>

There have been so many changes in the provision of careers services in recent years that it is difficult to keep up with them. My conversations with people in schools indicate that they have the same problem&#151;they are not quite sure where the services are coming from. There is a clear distinction between careers education and careers advice. Both need to be of high quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="090624114000009"></a>The Connexions service has had its limitations because it was set up very much with the emphasis on the less high achieving young person. It was limited in its capacity. Consequently, a great deal of careers advice was thrown back onto the schools and the careers teachers, many of whom took it on as an act of goodwill, or because the head had caught them at a weak moment&#151;or perhaps because they had no choice, with a rather bossy head. They were unprepared for what they had to do.</p>

<a name="90624-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="090624114000010"></a>It is important to stand back a little and have a look, as this amendment suggests, now that there is a new body in place that is just beginning to come to terms with its duties, at exactly how careers advice operates and what quality is on offer. I should like even to extend it a little and have a look at what has grown up in the mean time: this rather ad hoc provision of careers education in schools, which has had to overlap, so to speak, and become not only careers education but also careers advice for many young people. I very much support what the amendment is trying to do.</p>

Before responding to the amendment, I want to say a couple of things about the Connexions service, because the noble Lord praised its work to begin with.

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="090624114000014"></a>The Connexions service does an important and good job. We have heard the views of young people and other stakeholders in past surveys, and they have been positive. We have had 28 Ofsted inspections of Connexions partnerships, of which 89 per cent were rated as satisfactory or better, which is encouraging. The 2008 Connexions Direct user survey found that 92 per cent of users reported that they were &#147;satisfied&#148; or &#147;very satisfied&#148; with the service, a slight increase from 89 per cent in 2006; it is clearly going in the direction of further improvement. There were particularly high ratings for ease of use of the internet services, about which the noble Lord was concerned when we discussed this in our previous debate. There were high ratings for the website and the user-friendliness of the advisers. Ninety per cent of those surveyed are likely to use Connexions Direct again. I wanted to inject that into our deliberations now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="090624114000015"></a>Amendment 72 calls for an independent review of the quality of careers advice and guidance provision and of the appropriateness of introducing an all-age careers service in England. As noble Lords are aware, we are already putting in place an ambitious set of policies to ensure that young people are provided with information, advice and guidance, and that they develop the skills they need to plan and manage their careers. This is important from the beginning of PSHE careers education, which we all know will be statutory. These policies have been informed by good practice, identified by such key delivery partners as the National College for School Leadership, the Training and Development Agency for Schools and the Learning and Skills Improvement Service. They seek to address what noble Lords have in the past described, perhaps rightly, as the patchiness of current provision, which ranges from excellent to unsatisfactory.</p>

These are key in driving up standards. These further developments will be set out in our forthcoming information, advice and guidance strategy, which will be published later this summer. Since we effectively have a break between Committee and Report, I hope that the noble Lords opposite will be able to have a good look at the strategy. No doubt we will discuss this further. The strategy has been developed in close collaboration with a wide variety of stakeholders. The new Adult Advancement and Careers Service will provide a seamless service, drawing together a full range of advice and support on such issues as jobs, skills, childcare, housing, and financial and personal

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="090624114000017"></a>It is very important that young people are provided with the help that they need to move from services aimed at young people to those for adults. There is no question about that; it is extremely important. We want to ensure that vulnerable young people are protected as they grow older and start to receive support from adult-orientated services. There are strong advantages to that. This calls for strong cross-organisational working between providers of IAG for young people and adults, which puts the individual at the centre of delivery and ensures that the quality of support is maintained as individuals progress from one delivery organisation to another. My department is therefore working closely with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions to provide closely co-ordinated services for young people and adults that provide individuals with the support that they need through an effective all-age strategy. This will be published in the summer. It will ensure that data-sharing and other arrangements are improved, securing smooth transitions. I hope that will meet some of the noble Lord&#146;s concerns. For example, from autumn 2010, all 19 year-olds will have the choice of using either Connexions services or the Adult Advancement and Careers Service, so there will not be that cliff edge, which I am sure the noble Lord would be concerned about.</p>

In considering the development of our strategy, I said, perhaps not quite as eloquently as I should like, that we are thinking carefully about how to ensure the delivery of a seamless service to people as they go from using a service targeted at young people to one for older people. The effect of that will be to experience the service as if it were an all-age service.</p>

I have listened to what she has said and I should like to give it more thought. In the circumstances, for this evening I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, referred to it right at the beginning of our proceedings and I, for one, am going to read what she said with great care because it seemed to me the best description so far of the way that the first part of the Bill might work.</p>

<a name="90624-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="090624114000034"></a>This clause is another example of control by the Secretary of State&#151;something that has also been mentioned today. It seems to me that the first part of the clause is unexceptional. It simply says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="090624114000102"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State must by order specify sectors of skill, trade or occupation for the purposes of this Chapter&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090624114000093"></a>For that, he will, as the Minister has told us, rely very much on the sector skills council.</p>

<a name="90624-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="090624114000035"></a>We have had some debate about the number of frameworks that will arise from the system, and I certainly would not want to prolong any kind of discussion as to whether Australia, or indeed Germany, have a better approach than the United Kingdom, although in my own chosen career of engineering the Germans have certainly been much stronger than us. Nevertheless, it behoves the Government, in consultation with the sector skills council, to know something about how many frameworks they expect to arrive at at some point in this process.</p>

<a name="90624-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="090624114000036"></a>The Minister has assured us about employers and has several times used the expression &#147;demand-led&#148;, and I think that that comes through. That is, of course, a very important part of what we are discussing, but I think that we should also remember that, to some extent, we are supply-driven in what we are doing. In quite a number of trades, quite frankly, there will not be enough apprenticeships, although the skills will be needed. One reason for that is the rise of the self-employed, although I do not think that that has been discussed so far in our proceedings. If, for example, you call on a builder to do quite complicated work, you may well find that the majority of the labour force who turn up are not employed by that builder but are

In all this, we need to ensure that we do not forget that the variables are extraordinary.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="090624114000037"></a>I was very struck by the amendments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Layard, who, not surprisingly, is not in his place at this late hour. It seemed to me that there would be circumstances in which his prescription for the mix between on-the-job and off-the-job learning was exactly right. Unfortunately, there would be many other circumstances when his prescription would not be right because of the variables. What continues to concern me is that the Government will inevitably have a tendency to think that they are the masters of the variables. Throughout the proceedings on this Bill I want to keep on trying to remind myself, and them, that that will not work. They will never be able to master the variables. The range and the diversity are too great. Any decision that a particular framework should fall into a particular sector is likely to be controversial. There are borderlines between one sector and another and as you get more and more frameworks there will be more and more borderline disputes. It is extremely difficult to get it right.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="090624114000038"></a>We then come to the subsection (2), which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="090624114000103"></a>&#147;The sectors specified ... must in the opinion of the Secretary of State encompass the full range of skills, trades and occupations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090624114000094"></a>In no circumstances will any Secretary of State of any party ever know the full range of skills, trades and occupations. It would be completely misleading to make it a duty of a Secretary of State to know that. In fact, I would say it was silly because it is an impossible task in today&#146;s multi-faceted world, in a global economy and with the march of technology.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="090624114000039"></a>I want to give one or two rather naive examples. First, there is cheese. Noble Lords will remember that in the years after the war, French cheeses had complete dominance, particularly any soft cheese. We were quite good at hard cheeses&#151;we had Cheddar, Stilton, Wensleydale, Lancashire and a few others&#151;but we were not very good at soft cheeses. I also remember that de Gaulle said that it was impossible to govern a country which makes 96 types of cheese.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="090624114000040"></a>In subsequent years, what has happened? I do not know whether noble Lords eat Somerset goats cheese, but I thoroughly recommend it. I do not know whether they have come across Mrs Bells of Thirsk who makes a soft blue cheese which is sold in Sainsbury&#146;s. That development of cheeses, which has gone on apace, very satisfactorily, is subject to a good deal of secrecy. The formulae are not known by everyone. The commercial considerations under which you brand a cheese&#151;and in the case of Sainsbury&#146;s, accept that Mrs Bells can brand a cheese&#151;are quite complicated. The idea that the Secretary of State would ever know the full range of the needs of cheese apprenticeships is for the birds; it is not something that he could know or even want to know if he were conscious of his position.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="090624114000041"></a>That does not take us to matters digital, but if noble Lords think for a bit about the way in which matters digital develop and what that might mean for the needs of training and apprenticeships, they will see that it is just not sensible to give the Secretary of State  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1652"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1652</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that responsibility. What will happen if we do? He will have to work on the convoy principle: he will have to come down to the speed of the slowest. He would be well advised by his civil servants that that is the only way in which he would be able to cope with that responsibility, so he would stifle innovation. Clause 37(2) should be deleted. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="090624114000042"></a><b><a name="90624-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090624114000136"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> Like my noble friend Viscount Eccles, we would all be very interested to hear from the Minister what the Government consider to be a full range of skills, trades and occupations.</p>

My cheese-related concern is that the legislation does not resemble Gruyre in being full of holes. I am reliably informed that the Wensleydale factory had some apprenticeships when it was checked by my noble friend Lady Thornton. That is enough cheese for this evening. I reassure the noble Viscount that the self-employed can undertake apprenticeships.</p>

Carillion ran an interesting scheme in which the apprentices went out to very small firms&#151;I think that some of them were self-employed tradesmen. There are circumstances where this happens, usually involving group training associations and the like. I agree absolutely with the noble Viscount on the subject of government mastery of all the variables. If we tried to do that, we would inevitably fail. I will come back to that point.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="090624114000046"></a>The amendment would allow the Secretary of State to specify, by order under Clause 37(1), sectors for the purposes of Chapter 1, but he would not be required to cover the full range of skills, trades and occupations, as Clause 37(2) provides. It is important that the apprenticeship provisions of the Bill apply to sectors covering the full range of skills, trades and occupations. This will ensure the broadest range of opportunities for our potential apprentices and for employers, as well as a level of consistency in the provision of apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="090624114000047"></a>This clause requires the Secretary of State to specify apprenticeship sectors. This is necessary for the effective functioning of the apprenticeship scheme in the Bill. Clause 90 requires those meeting the eligibility conditions of the apprenticeship scheme to choose two available sectors when they elect to join the scheme. The commissioning of apprenticeship places by the local authorities, and the contracting of these places by the Skills Funding Agency, will be on the basis of apprenticeship sectors. As we explained in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill, the sectors will follow the footprint of the sector skills councils.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="090624114000048"></a>The noble Viscount raises an interesting question about how the Secretary of State could ever hope to fulfil this commitment and I am grateful for his concern.  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1653"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 1653</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The 25 sector skills councils, covering 85 per cent of the UK workforce, will be responsible for delivering a coherent range of apprenticeship frameworks across their sectors. For skills, trades or occupations that are outside their footprint, the sector skills councils have established strategic partnerships, and some less formal arrangements, with relevant bodies to ensure apprenticeship coverage across the full range of skills, trades and occupations. I prefer to aim wide in terms of coverage, rather than risk narrowing the breadth of opportunities for our young people.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="090624114000049"></a>I return to the concern of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, that the Secretary of State will be personally responsible for identifying the full range of apprenticeships needed. That will not be the case. I return to the point that we agree on: this is a demand-led system and, if employers tell us that there is a need for apprenticeships, those apprenticeships will emerge. Employers will be in discussion with the sector skills councils, which have only one job&#151;to make sure that those apprenticeships live up to the criteria defined in the specification and standards. We have not yet convinced people that this is a demand-led system, rather than the Secretary of State having to accurately determine what skills and apprenticeships are needed. These will emerge from what employers tell us is required. We feel that we have got the framing of the clause right. We need to have the widest possible range of apprenticeships available for the reasons that I have previously explained. I thank the noble Viscount for raising this issue because it gave us an opportunity to discuss it, but I hope that, on the basis of what I have explained, he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

In answer to the question about how new sectors get recognised, the Minister pointed to the UKCES as the body that will recognise new things.

The Alliance of Sector Skills Councils represents the group as a whole, so if it emerged that there was a new area that required a sector skills council, it would be participating in the discussion about an additional sector skills council. The sector skills councils evolve and change over time, but we have no plans to abolish the UKCES. To be helpful in this matter, I will examine that procedure in relation to the establishment of a new sector skills council and write to the noble Baroness and possibly clarify the situation.</p>

When we look at the bodies that the Bill will change across the whole front of government policy and at the huge range of apparently rock-like organisations that have been swept away and replaced by others, rather less rock-like and sometimes not so efficient, we feel that there is a need for assurance about the durability of these organisations. That is why there is some desire to see them on the face of statute, so that they cannot be eroded administratively but must be removed, if they are to be removed, with the sanction of Parliament.</p>

There has been a variation on that theme in relation to how a new sector skills council would originate for a new area of skills. We should address both those questions. Our view is that they are the bedrock of the apprenticeship scheme and without them we would have no means of being able to say that this is a demand-led scenario. We have said that we will write to noble Lords on the matter and give further consideration to sector skills councils.

The pace of change is such that, if he or she is obliged to keep up to date with the full range, he or she will have to submit an order at regular intervals as a result of the advice and deliberations of the sector skills councils and the employers.</p>

<a name="090624114000063"></a><b><a name="90624-0012.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="090624114000153"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> Amendment 74 stands in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford. I shall speak also to Amendment 175 which, again, stands in both our names. I remind the Committee that in the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper in 2007 one of the facts highlighted was that 30 per cent of care leavers are not in employment, education or training. It is a large percentage of care leavers. I hope that the Bill will go a long way to addressing that point, but I hope also that we may be able to go further, which is what my amendments strive to do.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="090624114000064"></a>The Minister spoke of the long summer break that we will be having. I hope that in the course of the summer break the Government might look carefully at the Bill and see whether any measures might be introduced into it specifically for care leavers and looked-after children and what more might be done in enabling more of those young people to have access to apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="090624114000065"></a>Amendment 74 would oblige local authorities and government departments, wherever possible, to prioritise care leavers when those organisations have apprenticeship agreements. My amendment would assist Her Majesty&#146;s Government in their aspiration for improving outcomes for care leavers. The <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper highlighted the way in which many young people in care do not receive the support that they need in order to be successful in life. To remedy that failure on our part, the Government have introduced a raft of measures, including priority for looked-after children in school admissions. They have the first admission priority. These amendments follow the Government&#146;s precedent in those other areas. My intention at this stage is simply to probe the Government, but I hope that the Minister will at least accept the principle behind the amendments. We have special duties to these children and I hope that the Minister will agree that we should take every opportunity to discharge them.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="090624114000066"></a>My amendment gives a priority to care leavers wherever possible. It is not my intention that care leavers should be shoe-horned into apprenticeships where they are likely not to do well. As your Lordships will be aware, many care leavers have experienced lack of stability in care and a disruptive education. They often still leave at the age of 16 and often find themselves placed in inappropriate accommodation. It seems wholly sensible therefore to extend this duty to the age of 25, which would allow them the extra time that they need to find their feet and to access employment and training.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="090624114000067"></a>By prioritising care leavers in this way, we are also protecting ourselves against the cost and harm of allowing these young people to fail. Care leavers are heavily over-represented in the criminal justice system. However, an apprenticeship may divert many care leavers from this route. The young offender programme developed by National Grid has reduced reoffending rates from 70 per cent to below 7 per cent by getting offenders into work. I declare my interest as having accepted hospitality from National Grid in the past. This amendment or something similar might prevent some care leavers from entering this vicious circle downwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="090624114000068"></a>Amendment 175 would allow the chief executive of skills funding to secure provision of facilities for suitable apprenticeship training for care leavers from the age of 16 to 25. It would give care leavers an extra window of several years. As I have said, many care leavers have experienced disruption in their family lives and education, and may come to maturity late. Often, they are given responsibilities too early and far beyond their capacities. This amendment would give them an extra chance to benefit from the Bill. Many care leavers will seize this chance once they have recovered from the early disruption I have described. This amendment reflects the precedent set in the Children (Leaving Care) Act, which gave local authorities responsibility to support care leavers in educational training to the age of 25. I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on how these amendments interact with the Children (Leaving Care) Act. My wording may be faulty, but I hope that the Minister can accept the spirit of these amendments. I look forward to his response. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_214"></a>
<a name="090624114000069"></a><b><a name="90624-0012.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="090624114000154"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b><b></b>I gladly attached my name to this amendment when the noble Earl asked me whether I would be prepared to back it, because this is a very important issue. We know that the Government are putting a lot of pressure on public authorities to take apprentices. I believe that quite a number of them are now beginning to respond. Earlier today the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, pointed out that the University of Greenwich is thinking of taking on apprentices. I was delighted to hear that.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="090624114000070"></a>As the noble Earl has said, those who are leaving care are disproportionately not represented among apprentices at the moment. Many of them are found in the category of NEET; that is, neither in education, employment nor training. Last year, we put through this House the Children and Young Persons Bill. The noble Earl mentioned that a lot of priority was given to these young people in different ways. We discussed the lack of job opportunities for them and the need to provide more.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="090624114000071"></a>On looking at the wording, the thought that 10 per cent of these apprenticeships might go to young care leavers is perhaps a bit over the top. However, it is important to make the point that many of these young people come from chaotic backgrounds, as the noble Earl indicated. These are the kinds of young people that Rathbone and Barnardo&#146;s are picking up and helping, but they need apprenticeships to go into. The types of training that Rathbone and Barnardo&#146;s give to them are, in some respects, pre-apprenticeship training and, unless there are opportunities for them to go on to an apprenticeship, that will mean nothing very much. Going on from the pre-apprenticeship training given by Rathbone and Barnardo&#146;s to a good apprenticeship in the public sector, where they are paid a guaranteed salary, would be a thoroughly good thing.</p>

<a name="90624-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="090624114000072"></a>Therefore, in the spirit of the amendment, I hope the Minister will be able to give us some indication that pressure will be put on public authorities to make good on this, not only in terms of endeavours but in terms of being required to look at, measure and quantify how many apprenticeships should go to former care leavers.</p>

The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, rightly brings to our attention the circumstances of young people in care and their transition from foster homes to further education and the workplace. At a time when we are discussing provision of education to a number of different groups, it is right that we should consider the inherent disadvantages faced by those in care and search for ways to address this imbalance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="090624114000074"></a>Amendment 74 lists public authorities in paragraphs (a) to (k) and we agree that these authorities should be strongly urged to have regard to the situation of those leaving care and the positive effect that an apprenticeship agreement could have upon their lives. However, we have some concerns about the amendment. While we agree with the sentiment behind it, we feel&#151;indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, recognised this&#151;that it is perhaps too restrictive to insist upon public authorities having to ensure that at least 10 per cent of all their apprenticeship agreements are made with care leavers between the ages of 16 and 25. This could have perverse, unforeseen and detrimental consequences for other groups which may be equally deserving of an apprenticeship agreement. We would be wary of supporting an amendment which might encourage discrimination against other groups.</p>

<a name="90624-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="090624114000075"></a>Nevertheless, the idea behind the noble Earl&#146;s amendment seems both sensible and well intentioned and perhaps a middle way can be found.</p>

Again, it carries through the intention of the Children and Young Persons Act in which, as noble Lords will remember, a duty was laid on schools to pay particular attention to the needs of these young people and not to move them too often&#151; as we know, local authorities had tended in the past to move them from place to place&#151;particularly when they are coming up to any kind of exam taking.</p>

<a name="90624-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="090624114000077"></a>The amendment would be an extremely important extra nudge to all the local authorities and other organisations listed here. I would like to think that an even wider selection might be encouraged to do this automatically, including a number of companies. I would like to see an even wider age range because young people who have been in these kinds of situations tend to grow up even later than 25, but, being realistic, we have to consider only these ages at the moment.</p>

<a name="90624-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="090624114000078"></a>I understand what other noble Lords have said about the 10 per cent and it may be that it is too large a specific sum. However, if the Minister who is going to reply could take aboard the intentions behind it, it might be possible to work out something appropriate which will meet the needs of everyone who has spoken.</p>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, we spent a long time during the passage of the Children and Young Persons Bill asking local authorities to be that pushy parent that children need in schools. If we are going to utilise the talents of all our young people, it is important that public authorities look to what young people may do in apprenticeships and be that pushy parent that we want them to be.</p>

I have reservations about subsection (1) of the proposed new clause, which my noble friend on the Front Bench has made clear. It may be possible to tweak that, or to find another way. However, the aim of getting substantial numbers of and, if possible, all care leavers into apprenticeships is laudable, particularly as we spent a lot of this afternoon talking about foundation skills, which is exactly what care leavers normally lack. Therefore, since they tend to be overrepresented in the criminal institutions, it will pay the Government and society, as well as those children, to get them into training that can equip them with foundation skills. Those skills will be useful not just for the jobs that they go to but also for managing their lives.</p>

The amendment would require, wherever possible, specified public bodies in England to ensure that a minimum of 10 per cent of their apprentices were care leavers between the ages of 16 and 25.</p>

<a name="90624-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="090624114000082"></a>I assure the Committee that the Government are totally committed to ensuring that apprenticeship opportunities in both the public and private sectors&#151;we should not ignore the private sector&#151;are open to care leavers. We know that some young people in care have a complex set of problems that may mean that they take a bit longer to adjust to the demands of the workplace and so may not be ready by 18 to take up an apprenticeship place. That is why we have already made an amendment to the Bill in another place to extend the apprenticeship scheme to suitably qualified care leavers aged 18 to 21. That will extend to the age of 24 once an amendment made by the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 to Section 23CA of the Children Act 1989 is commenced.</p>

<a name="90624-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="090624114000083"></a>I understand the intention behind Amendment 74, but we consider that its operation would be flawed. The 10 per cent target, as a number of noble Lords have commented, is unrealistic given the number of care leavers in relation to the number of public sector apprenticeships. I recognise that the public sector has an important part to play in ensuring that opportunities are available for care leavers, as for other young disadvantaged people. I also agree that the public sector does not yet provide enough apprenticeships. Currently, the public sector employs about 20 per cent of the national workforce but has less than 10 per cent of its apprentices. We are keen to address this imbalance, which is why we are looking for the public sector to provide at least 21,000 additional apprenticeship places in 2009-10.</p>

<p><a name="090624114000095"></a>Among other things, this initiative aims to develop a national career support model for young people leaving care, including a national network and register of private, public and third sector employers who will sign up to a commitment to develop employment support initiatives for young people in and from care. I share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that we need not just pushy parents but pushy authorities and corporates.</p>

<a name="90624-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="090624114000086"></a>We have not yet modelled the apprenticeship demand for those young people entitled to care-leaving support under age 18. However, we estimate that there are around 500 care leavers a year aged 18 to 24 who would want and have the ability to undertake an apprenticeship. Many of them would be employed in the private sector. As your Lordships can see, there is a disparity in the relative numbers and it will be impossible for most public authorities to reach the 10 per cent target. I will certainly commit to draw it to the attention of public sector employers and the departmental ministerial apprenticeship champions that care leavers up to the age of 25 are eligible for a place under the entitlement and ensure that prospective care leavers have access to information about apprenticeship opportunities in both the public and private sectors.</p>

<a name="90624-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="090624114000087"></a>In conclusion, we share the concern not just of the noble Earl but of all those who have contributed to this debate. It is in the interests of all of us&#151;in society&#146;s interests&#151;to ensure that these care leavers do not become part of the NEET population, and that we make every effort to ensure that they get their share of apprenticeships. We encourage all local government departments to play their part in achieving this. I hope that in the light of those comments the noble Earl will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="090624114000090"></a>My noble friend Lady Howe spoke about going perhaps beyond the age of 25.

Nowadays, the average age of a young person leaving home is 24, so there is a lot to be said for going even further than the Minister has gone. However, what he said is extremely encouraging

<p><a name="09062491000003"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09062491000160"></a>Lord Brett:</b> If I may, I propose to provide your Lordships with a detailed explanation of the largely technical amendments which this order seeks to achieve.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000004"></a>I do not think that any speech of mine has ever been described as riveting, but I am certainly clear that not many speeches on pensions made by anyone in this world have been described as riveting, unless perhaps delivered to the Institute of Actuaries. Accordingly, I apologise in advance for the thousand or so words that I am going to deliver, and I hope only that I can deliver them all in the order in which they are on the paper and resist my normal temptation, which is to speak too quickly.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000005"></a>The order is made under Section 104 of the Scotland Act 1998, which allows for necessary or expedient changes to UK legislation in consequence of an Act of the Scottish Parliament. It is made in consequence of the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009, which sets out updated arrangements for paying the pensions of Members of the Scottish Parliament and related officeholders. Those officeholders are the Presiding Officer and Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Ministers, including the First Minister and junior Scottish Ministers.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000006"></a>The purpose of the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009 is to place the arrangements for paying the pensions of MSPs and related officeholders on to a  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC454"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more permanent statutory footing, largely replacing transitional arrangements made at the time of devolution. The Act sets out new rules for the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme that largely take account of developments in UK pensions, tax and equalities legislation.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000007"></a>The order makes minor amendments to ensure that from 1 September 2009, when the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009 comes into full force, aspects  of reserved pensions legislation continue to apply appropriately to the existing pension schemes for MSPs and related officeholders, further to changes brought about by the Act once this is fully commenced from 1 September this year.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000008"></a>Prior to the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009, the pension schemes for MSPs and related officeholders were the subject of a transitional order&#151;the Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions) (Scottish Parliamentary Pension Scheme) Order&#151;made under the Scotland Act 1998. It was always intended that the Scottish Parliament would legislate to put the pension schemes of MSPs and related officeholders on to a more permanent statutory footing. Section 81(3) of the Scotland Act 1998 envisages the Scottish Parliament legislating to replace the transitional arrangements made at the time of devolution. In addition, there have been a number of changes to UK legislation in the reserved areas of the regulation of occupational pensions, tax and equalities which necessitated amendment to the transitional order.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000009"></a>Although Section 81 of the Scotland Act 1998 permits the Scottish Parliament to make provision for the pensions of MSPs and related officeholders by resolution, an Act of the Scottish Parliament was needed in this case to bring about the necessary changes to the transitional order. The Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009 continues the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme, subject to new rules set out in Schedule 1 to that Act. These new rules contain provisions for both MSPs and officeholders. The separate unfunded scheme for First Ministers and Presiding Officers set out in the transitional order is continued but is closed to new members, who will be covered by the new rules of the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000010"></a>The two amendments in the Section 104 order are of a technical nature. They are required to ensure that certain reserved regulatory controls continue to apply appropriately to the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme and the existing First Minister and Presiding Officer pension scheme, once the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009 is fully in place. The first amendment is to Section 11(7) of the Pensions Act 1995 and ensures that the Pensions Regulator continues, in limited circumstances, to have the power to adapt, amend or repeal the legislation that contains the rules of the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme and the First Minister and the Presiding Officer pension scheme.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000011"></a>The second amendment is to Section 249A(3) of the Pensions Act 2004, which requires the trustees or managers of occupational pension schemes to establish and operate internal controls. Section 249A(3) sets out various types of schemes that are exempt from that obligation. That includes schemes which are established under an enactment and are guaranteed by a public authority, and the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme,  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC455"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC455</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as currently constituted, falls within this exemption. Further to the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009, the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme will not be covered by that exemption as it will not be a scheme guaranteed by a public authority. Therefore an amendment adding the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme into the list of exempt schemes at Section 249A(3) is required. The First Minister and Presiding Officer pension scheme does not require an equivalent amendment, as it is a pay-as-you-go scheme and as such is already exempt under Section 249A(3)(b).</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000012"></a>Noble Lords may also wish to note that, in addition to this order, it is proposed that two sets of regulations will be made by UK Ministers, further to the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009. The Department for Work and Pensions is currently consulting on drafts of these regulations and will take forward the Occupational Pension Scheme (Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009) Regulations and the Occupational Pension Scheme (Public Service Pension Schemes) Regulations. The latter of these two sets of regulations will be made jointly by the Department for Work and Pensions and HM Treasury.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000013"></a>The Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009 was the product of a committee Bill brought forward by the Scottish Parliament. It is intended that the newly appointed fund trustees of the Scottish parliamentary contributory pension fund will issue guidance to the members of the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme on the new scheme rules, which are effective from 1 September 2009.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000014"></a>This order demonstrates the Government&#146;s commitment to working with the Scottish Parliament to make the devolution settlement work. I hope noble Lords will agree that this order is a sensible use of the powers in the Scotland Act and that the practical result is something to be welcomed. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000015"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09062491000161"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> I thank the Minister for doing such an exemplary job of taking us through the inner workings of the modification of this order. The routine being followed is an example of proper forethought by the parliamentary draftsmen of the Scotland Act in foreseeing areas where a split responsibility might cause problems. That is one reason why we have gone through this amazing jungle of sections that apply.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000016"></a>Did I understand the Minister to say that the present scheme under which the Presiding Officer and the First Minister receive their pensions is somehow being brought to a close, and that they will then be incorporated under the provisions that will be in place when this order is brought in? If that scheme is brought to a close, do we have any idea what the current liability is under it, or is it a continuing liability that will simply be built on by the new scheme when it comes in?</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000017"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for giving us at least the title for the further two sets of proposed regulations. I do not know if anything more can be said to explain what they might contain&#151;I took it from what he said that perhaps the Department for Work and Pensions is not quite sure what they will contain at the moment&#151;but any indication about that might be useful, as well as  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC456"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC456</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about which procedure this is intended to follow. Schedule 7 to the Scotland Act has a wonderful array of procedures that can be followed when bringing in different parts of legislation under the devolution Act. Section 12(1) says that some can be passed under the authority of an Order in Council or on the authority of a Minister of the Crown. Is either of those options a path that the Government will be following on this measure?</p>

<p><a name="09062491000018"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09062491000162"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> These Benches also thank the Minister for introducing the order. I think it is the first time, either in Committee or in the House, that I have seen a bench of officials that is entirely female, which is very nice. I look forward to the day when we have not only a bench of officials that is entirely female but a female Minister as well.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000019"></a>We broadly support this measure. However, I heard the noble Lord say that there is a separate unfunded pension scheme for Scottish Ministers, which is indeed the case here down south in the United Kingdom. I am not as familiar as I should be with the scheme for MSPs. Is there a separate funded scheme and, if so, what is the contribution that their employers&#151;the Scottish taxpayer&#151;make to the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme as a percentage of Members&#146; salaries?</p>

<p><a name="09062491000020"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09062491000163"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I thank noble Lords for their contributions. The only question I will not attempt to answer&#151;it may have been an observation from the noble Lord&#151;concerns the officials behind me. I think it comes fairly close to being sexist as a remark and is not one that I know my partner would appreciate, were it said about her. Comments about a Minister are matters of judgment and I am sure that in that sense he is perfectly correct.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000021"></a>I shall attempt to deal with the questions in the order that they were asked. Why is the existing First Minister pension scheme now being closed? The Scottish parliamentary pension scheme committee concluded that the existing First Minister and Presiding Officer pension schemes should be closed to future members and that future holders of these offices should be subject to the same pension arrangements as those applicable to Scottish Ministers. This is consistent with the pension arrangements for similar officeholders in the Welsh Assembly and recommendations by the SSRB in its triennial review of parliamentary pay and pensions published in January 2008. Under the 2009 Act, the new rules of the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme make specific provision for a category of officeholder members of the scheme. These officeholders include persons who in future will hold the offices of Presiding Officer, Deputy Presiding Officer, Scottish Minister and junior Scottish Minister.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000022"></a>Reference was made to the cost implications of the changes brought about by the Act. The Government Actuary&#146;s Department has costed the revised parliamentary scheme in Scotland against the existing scheme. This review showed that the expected cost of the scheme under the new rules will not be materially different from that under the existing rules. The precise point of the question concerned the closure of the existing First Minister and Presiding Officer schemes to future officeholders. It is expected that this will  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC457"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC457</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>result in a net saving in relation to the pension arrangements for these offices of about &#163;850,000 every four years.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000023"></a>As regards what is meant by unfunded schemes, the existing scheme is non-contributory. Pension payments under that scheme are paid from the Scottish Consolidated Fund on a pay-as-you-go basis. That scheme will be closed to new entrants from 1 September, leaving only those pensions in payment, or those due to existing officeholders, to be met under the scheme. There is provision in the new pension scheme rules for the Scottish parliamentary pension scheme for future holders of the offices to be officeholder members in the scheme. As such, they will make contributions under the new scheme rules.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000024"></a>Reference was also made to taking forward the regulations. I suggest that will be done by the Department for Work and Pensions, although I cannot be precise about that. The point of the consultation is to find out the best way forward. Of the two sets one will be taken forward by the DWP and the other by the Treasury. They will make a number of consequential amendments to secondary legislation to ensure that the existing Scottish parliamentary pension scheme and First Minister and Presiding Officer pension schemes continue to be treated as public service pension schemes further to the changes to them brought about by the 2009 Act. It will be when those regulations are drawn up that the question of the parliamentary procedure to be adopted will be determined.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000025"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09062491000164"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> If the noble Lord seriously thinks that what I said was sexist, frankly that is just political correctness gone mad. It was a positive encouragement. I am bound to say, since he takes that ridiculous attitude, that the flow of paper coming from his officials showed quite clearly that they knew far more about what was going on than he did. Perhaps I am being unfair, but that is a ridiculous reaction and I hope that, on reflection, he withdraws it.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000026"></a>I do not expect the noble Lord necessarily to know now, but I ask him to undertake to write to me about what the employer&#151;that is, the Scottish taxpayer&#151;contribution is expected to be when the new scheme comes in. The cost of public sector pensions is a matter of great public interest and I hope that he will take his responses a bit more seriously and undertake to write to me with that information.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000027"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09062491000165"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I thank the noble Lord. I am more than happy to withdraw any imputation in the light of his comments. The question of whether one is being polite across this or any other Chamber is in the eyes and ears of the beholder and observer. I will certainly take his point on board and will write to him in due course.</p>

<p>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the European Organization for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere (Immunities and Privileges) Order 2009.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000030"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09062491000169"></a>Lord Brett:</b> The order was laid before the House on 1 June 2009, together with an Explanatory Memorandum, as required for all affirmative statutory instruments. The draft order will confer the legal capacities of a body corporate and privileges and immunities upon the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, also known as the European Southern Observatory. The order also confers privileges and immunities on representatives of the states parties, the director-general and officials of the organisation.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000031"></a>These privileges and immunities are conferred in accordance with the agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the European Southern Observatory concerning the accession to the convention establishing a European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere and related terms and conditions, which was signed on behalf of the United Kingdom on 21 May 2002. The ESO convention obliges the United Kingdom to abide by the terms of the instruments of the ESO, including its multilateral protocol on privileges and immunities. The order implements those obligations in UK law.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000032"></a>The ESO was created in 1962 and currently has 14 member states, the UK becoming a member in 2002. It is the pre-eminent intergovernmental science and technology organisation in ground-based astronomy. It carries out an ambitious programme focused on the design, construction and operation of powerful ground-based observing facilities for astronomy, to enable important scientific discoveries. The ESO employs about 700 staff members across the world. Its headquarters, comprising scientific, technical and admin divisions, are located in Garching, which is near Munich, in Germany; however, its observatories are located in Chile. The ESO operates three world-class observing sites in the Atacama desert region of Chile: La Silla, Paranal and Chajantor.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000033"></a>Through the ESO, the UK is playing a critical role. The UK&#146;s industry and research community is delivering key elements of the global project through provision of novel construction materials and the construction and testing of receivers and support systems. The UK is playing a significant role in the ESO&#146;s development of the European extremely large telescope&#151;E-ELT&#151;a proposed 42-metre-diameter facility planned to be

UK companies have worked on the design of the dome for this and the polishing of the mirror segments, while universities and research institutions are intimately involved in the design of potential instruments.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000034"></a>The ESO is funded through the contributions of member states&#151;approximately &#8364;130 million, with the UK's contribution in 2008 about &#8364;24 million. In addition to access to the most advanced ground- based optical observatory in the world, UK membership of the ESO brings to the UK an industrial return which will form the basis for training a new generation of technologists in a wide range of disciplines contributing to the strength of the UK's research base. The industrial return amounted to &#8364;14 million in 2008, 25 per cent of all the contracts and second in scale only to Germany.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000035"></a>The order, and a similar order to be passed by the Scottish Parliament covering devolved issues, will allow the United Kingdom Government to comply with their international obligations in giving full effect to the protocol on privileges and immunities for the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000036"></a>I am satisfied that the order is compatible with the European Convention of Human Rights. It is important and, I trust, non-controversial. I hope that it will receive the full support of the House.</p>

It puts into effect in this country an existing multilateral protocol on privileges and immunities agreed by the original parties to the European Organisation for Astronomical Research and signed in Paris in 1974. When the United Kingdom joined the organisation in 2002, it also became a signatory to that multilateral agreement, and this instrument is designed to give legal force to those obligations. The European Southern Observatory facility in the Atacama Desert in Chile has, for instance, a new technology telescope that, using active optics, can compensate for atmospheric conditions. It also has a very large telescope&#151;VLT&#151;array consisting of four eight-metre telescopes. There are also plans to build a European extremely large telescope.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000038"></a>Those projects have pushed back the limit of observable space and have made notable discoveries, which include Gliese 581e&#151;the lightest exoplanet yet found, just under twice the size of earth but more than 20 light years away&#151;evidence of a black hole at the centre of our galaxy, and what is possibly the furthest galaxy ever seen. All that comes from facilities 2,400 metres up in the middle of the driest desert in the world, in northern Chile. If it sounds like a set from a James Bond film, that is because it was; in &#147;Quantum of Solace&#148;, the baddie, Dominic Greene, chose the ESO facility in Chile as his hideout.</p>

First, given that the headquarters are in Germany and the facilities in Chile, what practical effect&#151;if any&#151;will putting the instruments into UK law have on this country? Why is this order necessary? For instance, will anyone enter the UK using diplomatic immunity under this instrument? Will the organisation claim any exemptions from United Kingdom tax? Secondly, can the Minister assure me that the fall in sterling will not affect the UK Government&#146;s funding of the project, and that there will be no knock-on effect on other projects funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council? Thirdly, how many British staff will be working in Chile or Germany under diplomatic immunity? Lastly, given that this country signed the agreement in 2002, why are we dealing with it now?</p>

We have no objection in principle to this order, but perhaps I may ask him&#151;to be honest, as much for my information as for anything else&#151;who are the members of the European Organisation for Astronomical Research, what is its budget, what currency is the budget fixed in and for how long, what proportion of it does Britain pay, and can he briefly explain the benefits of Britain&#146;s membership?</p>

Why is the order required? It is because the UK, in acceding to the convention established for this organisation, is to abide by the terms of the instruments of the ESO including the international protocols signed by the organisation with other member states. There are 14 member states: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.</p>

On the other, quite legitimate, points he raised, it will be easier for me to write to him, if that is satisfactory, and set out the answers in some detail.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000043"></a>I was asked what the status is of ESO officials and whether they are exempt from UK income tax. That is unlikely to be an issue, given that the ESO&#146;s headquarters will not be in the United Kingdom. However, the order provides for exemptions which presumably apply also to citizens from overseas working in either Chile or Germany. I do not think that we have information on how many personnel there are, but we will seek the most up-to-date information and provide it.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000044"></a>How will the order affect the United Kingdom? It is unlikely to have many implications for the UK because the organisation&#146;s headquarters are in Germany and it operates in the southern hemisphere. However, if the ESO were to hold a meeting in the UK, as it did in 2002, representatives of the states parties and officials of the organisation would enjoy the privileges and immunities entered into in our acceptance of this order.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000048"></a><a name="90624-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09062491000174"></a><b>Lord Davies of Oldham</b><b>:</b></b> I shall speak also to the Amendments to Law (Resolution of Dunfermline Building Society)(No. 2) Order 2009. Before discussing the draft compensation order, perhaps I may explain why the Treasury took the decision to withdraw the draft instrument laid before Parliament on 4 June and to re-lay it on 15 June. A very minor error was identified in paragraph 7(5) of Schedule 1 to the original draft order; the reference to &#147;properly or reasonably&#148; should have been to &#147;properly and reasonably&#148;. We did not consider that it was appropriate to correct this error using the correction slip process, so withdrew and replaced that draft order. I apologise to the Committee for that slip.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000049"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the Dunfermline Building Society was resolved on 30 March by the Bank of England effecting a transfer of part of Dunfermline&#146;s business to Nationwide, and part to a bridge bank. Dunfermline was then placed in special administration following an application to court.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000050"></a>Where the Bank of England exercises its property transfer powers, the Treasury is required under the Banking Act to put in place compensation arrangements. The draft order that we are debating today makes provision: for the compensation scheme, at Part 2, in relation to the transfer of business to Nationwide; the resolution fund, at Part 4, which makes provision for entitlements to the proceeds of resolution arising from the disposal of the business of the bridge bank; and the third party compensation provisions, at Part 5, which provide for the mechanism for assessing any compensation payable to third parties affected by each transfer and establish the scheme for assessing any compensation payable under the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; safeguard. I will briefly overview these components.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000051"></a>First, the draft order specifies that compensation payable to Dunfermline in respect of the transfer of the business to Nationwide should be nil. As the Committee will be aware, the basic principle under Article 1, Protocol 1, of the European Convention on Human Rights is that compensation for expropriations  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC462"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC462</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of property must normally bear a reasonable relation to the value of the property expropriated. The auction process conducted by the Bank during the weekend of 28 to 30 March effectively determined that the market value of the business was nil because the winning bidder did not pay any consideration. Therefore, the Treasury does not consider it appropriate to engage a valuer to assess the value of the business, and has exercised its discretion under Section 49(2)(a) of the Banking Act to specify in the order that the compensation payable is to be nil.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000052"></a>Secondly, the draft order makes provision for the arrangements for the resolution fund in relation to the transfer of business to the bridge bank. The fund is intended to act as a signal that the authorities do not intend to profit from the resolution.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000053"></a>Lastly, the third-party compensation scheme makes provision for an independent valuer to determine two things. The first thing to be determined is the amount of any compensation payable to any third party affected by an application of Section 38(6) of the Act&#151;that is, the section that specifies that the property transfer instrument made by the Bank is to be disregarded in determining whether a default event provision applies and has the effect of turning off third parties&#146; contractual termination rights. The valuer will also assess whether there is a difference between the treatment that pre-transfer creditors of Dunfermline would have received had Dunfermline gone into insolvency immediately before the transfers, and the actual treatment of those creditors arising as a result of the transfers. This is the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; safeguard, which makes provision for the valuer to assess whether it is necessary for the Treasury to pay any compensation in the event that pre-transfer creditors are left in a worse-off position as a result of the transfers.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000054"></a>I shall touch on the appointment process of the independent valuer. In January this year I made a commitment in Committee on the Banking Bill, which we will all recall vividly, about the extent to which the appointment of the valuer would be independent of Government. I said, as reported in <I>Hansard</I>:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062491000141"></a>&#147;At every stage, the Government have been at pains to ensure that the Treasury is one stage away from decisions that relate crucially to the appointment, performance and remuneration of the independent valuer&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/1/09; col. 1478.]</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000055"></a>The draft order provides for the Treasury to set up an appointment panel to appoint the independent valuer. Unlike the appointment process for the valuers appointed to conduct functions under the Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley compensation schemes, the panel will appoint the valuer rather than making a recommendation to the Treasury about the candidate to be appointed. We consider that this further enhances the already robust independence of the appointment processes that we have put in place in previous circumstances.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000056"></a>The second order, the Amendments to Law (Resolution of Dunfermline Building Society) (No. 2) Order, has been laid in draft under the powers in Section 75 of the Banking Act 2009, which enable the Treasury to make amendments to law so as to give effect to resolutions of failing banks.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC463"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC463</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000057"></a>As all Dunfermline&#146;s member business was to be transferred to Nationwide, the Bank&#146;s property transfer instrument was drafted so as to transfer all Dunfermline&#146;s business to Nationwide with the exception of certain property, rights and liabilities specified in the instrument. In particular, Dunfermline&#146;s &#163;660 million commercial loan book was not to be included in the transfer to Nationwide.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000058"></a>However, due diligence undertaken in the weeks following the transfer demonstrated that the technical definitions adopted in the property transfer instrument led to a significant proportion of the commercial loan book being erroneously transferred to Nationwide, together with a small number of social housing loans. &#147;Commercial loan&#148; was defined in the transfer instrument as a loan to persons who were not eligible claimants under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, as commercial entities would not normally be liable to compensation under the FSCS. &#147;Commercial mortgage loan&#148; was defined in similar terms. A small number of loans which were considered to form part of the social housing book were also transferred to Nationwide by the transfer instrument.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000059"></a>Further due diligence in the weeks following the transfer has identified, however, that a large number of the borrowers on the commercial loan book were in fact eligible claimants under the FSCS rules. That means that the effect of the instrument was to transfer these loans erroneously to Nationwide.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000060"></a>The order before the House today identifies each of the loans that is, and was always intended, to remain with Dunfermline by an individual identification number, listed in the schedule to the order. The order has retrospective effect to 8 am on Monday 30 March, the time when the transfer of Dunfermline&#146;s assets was made, and essentially corrects the error in the transfer instrument as though it had never been made. The effect in law is as though the loans had never been transferred to Nationwide.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000061"></a>In assessing the options to address the mistake  in the transfer instrument, the Bank of England, in consultation with the Treasury, has fully considered all possible commercial and contractual remedies that might have achieved the same effect as the draft order we are considering today. The Treasury is satisfied that use of this order and its retrospective effect is therefore necessary to ensure the completion of the Dunfermline resolution, and desirable so as to limit the call on public funds. Treasury and Bank of England officials have of course discussed the scope and content of the order with Nationwide and the administrators.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000062"></a>I merely add the obvious point that we considered at great length whether anything might prove to be retrospective in the Banking Act&#151;I recall the intensity with which that aspect was scrutinised. Here, an error occurred, which is why we are involved in some retrospective activity. I commend the orders.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000063"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09062491000175"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> Until the Minister stood up, I had not realised that we were debating the two orders together, which is entirely my fault, because I can see that properly stated on the Order Paper, so I will be shuffling my papers between the two. If the Minister  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC464"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC464</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will permit me, I will start with the second of the orders, where the Minister looked, I think, duly embarrassed about using Section 75&#151;not that the Minister should be embarrassed at what has happened, but I hope that there is a due degree of embarrassment at the Bank of England. When Parliament entrusted the property instrument power to the Bank of England under the Banking Act, that was done under the tacit assumption that the Bank of England would exercise the power competently. Clearly, it has not done so.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000064"></a>The various powers in the 2009 Act were not designed for frequent use&#151;indeed, we hope that they will not be used frequently&#151;but we are entitled to some assurance that lessons have been learnt from this occurrence. Has there been a proper formal post-mortem examination at the Bank of England with a view to identifying what went wrong and why? If this had been in a commercial document, it might not have been as easy to revise it as with the stroke of a pen on a statutory instrument.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000065"></a>The Minister referred to our lengthy discussions at various stages of the Banking Bill, and it is fair to say that he struggled to come up with any plausible way in which the Section 75 power would be used. Since then, we have had the No. 1 Dunfermline order, which made a whole raft of changes to law which some of us think could well have been made to the Bill, and had retrospection of the total amount of one hour and 45 minutes&#151;hardly a substantive use.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000066"></a>This order is a more substantive use of the power, but it is for a rather less substantive reason: that is, it is to correct the shoddy draftsmanship of the Bank of England. I am not going to object to the order today, because it is clearly convenient to have the Section 75 power to use in these sorts of situations. However, if the Minister had stood at the Dispatch Box during the passage of the Banking Bill and said that he needed the Section 75 power to correct drafting errors made by the Bank of England when using its property instrument power, we might have invited him to make a more targeted power in the Bill&#151;for example, to correct property transfer instruments&#151;but it is more likely that we would have fallen about laughing at the Government thinking it necessary to have such a power in the Bill to cope with incompetence. As I say, however, we will not object to the order; we simply hope that the Government are not proud of it.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000067"></a>The more substantive of the two orders which the Minister introduced is the Dunfermline Building Society Compensation Scheme, Resolution Fund and Third Party Compensation Order 2009. It is really four orders in one, because it covers the compensation scheme, the resolution fund and the third-party compensation scheme, as well as the appointment of a valuer to carry out the valuation of the amount of recovery for the purposes of the Dunfermline contribution to costs order, which we debated in May.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000068"></a>In broad terms, the order is not controversial. Indeed, I might even say that it is potentially very interesting for Banking Act anoraks&#151;those of us who survived the Banking Bill process&#151;because it will set up the first of these compensation schemes, resolution funds and third-party compensation orders; so it is the first time that these powers will be road-tested. We will  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC465"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC465</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>look very carefully at the progress of the use of the powers to see whether they stand up in the light of real facts and events.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000069"></a>I have a few questions for the Minister. First, will he update the Committee on what is happening to the Dunfermline Building Society? As I understand it, the social housing assets were initially transferred to a bridge bank, owned of course by the Bank of England, but last week the Nationwide, which of course was involved in the original transaction, also acquired those assets. Will the Minister say what the Nationwide paid for those assets relative to their face value? Does this transaction complete the work of the bridge bank that was set up as part of the Dunfermline rescue? Approximately how much&#151;I do not expect him to have definitive figures&#151;will be paid into the resolution fund? I think that that comes from the bridge bank.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000070"></a>Secondly, Dunfermline has been placed into administration. Does the Minister have any information on the progress of that administration, including the likely deficit to be borne by secured and unsecured creditors, including the pension fund? If he does not have the information, will he say how it can be obtained? I could not get any up-to-date information online, which is of considerable concern.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000071"></a>These questions are tangentially related to the work of the valuer appointed under Article 11 of the order, because the valuer will have to work out the &#147;amount of the recovery&#148; for the purposes of the contribution-to-costs order. I believe that the amount of the recovery is the amount that the valuer believes that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme would have got back from Dunfermline, had the FSCS paid out to depositors in the normal way under its rules and then recovered it. Will the Minister confirm that this will entitle&#151;indeed, require&#151;the valuer to assess the value of the business and assets of Dunfermline that would have been sold if Dunfermline had not been dealt with by the special resolution regime? The valuation is necessary irrespective of the fact that the Treasury has now determined the compensation available to Dunfermline as nil. That does not bind the valuer, who has to reach his own view on value. I ask the Minister to confirm that.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000072"></a>Will the Minister comment on the similarities to, or differences from, the calculations that the valuer will be required to make for the third-party compensation scheme? This concerns the amounts that would have been received by the creditors, but I assume that it involves some of the same underlying issues of how much the business was worth and therefore how much would have been paid out to the creditors had the business been dealt with in accordance with the assumptions that are specified.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000073"></a>In that connection I note that, in respect of the third-party compensation scheme, Part 3 of Schedule 2 has some detailed valuation principles about financial assistance and so on, which we have seen in other orders, and which have to guide the valuation. However, I could see no equivalent principles applying to the Article 11 valuation process&#151;that is, the process that will apply under the contribution-to-costs order. Can the Minister explain this disparity of approaches by the same valuer to two different parts of the task that he will be carrying out, and comment on whether that  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC466"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC466</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>might result in inconsistent valuations coming out of the process? Valuation principles are specified for one, although I do not believe that such principles have been specified for the other for the purposes of Article 11.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000074"></a>I have a couple of other detailed questions for the Minister. The first relates to the account holder for the resolution fund. Who is that likely to be? It is required by paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 1. Why does an independent person have to be appointed to hold the money? Why could the account at the Bank of England not simply be the Dunfermline resolution fund? Why does it have to be held in the name of an individual? What does that add?</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000075"></a>My other, more detailed, question relates to paragraph 3 of Schedule 2, which says that third-party compensation is to be paid only if it is required to be paid in order to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. What is this intended to do? In what circumstances would this proviso prevent compensation from otherwise being paid? Is this intended to restrict the operation of the rights to compensation triggered by Section 38(6) of the Banking Act? If so, why was this provision not included in the Bill? It seems quite a significant point to have been included in the order rather than the Bill. Also, has this point been consulted upon?</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000078"></a>Well, this looks like a fair old cock-up, doesn&#146;t it? I heard the Minister&#146;s remarks about technical changes and technical mistakes, but if my advisers in a commercial transaction presented me with this and said I had to go back to whoever was signing it all off, I would be incandescent. What happened? What was going on? Who was acting in the Bank of England? Was it acting for itself? Were lawyers involved? These seem to be very basic things that you check. If there were outside lawyers, what was the firm? What were they paid? I hope that the bill has not been paid. If they were from inside, I hope that a few people have been sacked. If outside lawyers were involved, what was the firm? What was it paid? I hope that the bill has not been paid. If it happened inside, I hope that a few people have been sacked. These are simple basic things, and for the Minister&#151;although it is obviously not his fault&#151;to have to come here and produce pages and pages of numbers of loans is deeply embarrassing and does not meet the standard of professionalism that we expect from the Bank of England. Can the Minister please answer those questions? Taxpayers are not getting value for money when such obvious mistakes are being made.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000079"></a>I thought that I heard him say something along the lines that it was discovered that borrowers on the commercial loan book were eligible claimants under Financial Services Compensation Scheme rules. That mystified me. Can the Minister explain more? I do not understand how borrowers can make claims. Perhaps I am being stupid.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000080"></a>I turn to the second order. Perhaps I may ask one or two more general questions about what happened here and where we are. It has become clear that there is a

It was clearly way out of its depth. There was horrific exposure to very dangerous sorts of property. For example, a large site in Bournemouth was not income-producing at all. Frankly, no experienced commercial lender should have been involved to anything like that extent&#151;certainly not amateurs playing in a market that they did not understand, like the people in the Dunfermline Building Society.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000081"></a>What independent property valuations have been done? When were the last valuations of the properties securing these large loans? If there has not been a valuation recently&#151;and we are in a depressed market, so it is easy to get the valuers to do a check valuation at low cost&#151;will the Minister undertake that there will be up-to-date valuations of the properties so that we can see how far under water the loans are?</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000082"></a>I have some scepticism about how much time and energy it will be worth investing in the valuation of any compensation payable, given what I believe to be the serious negative equity in which the loans are involved&#151;rather as I felt about Northern Rock. But that is a separate case; I am making a specific request that the Government come clean about the current value of the properties on which these loans are secured.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000083"></a>I am sorry; I should have declared an interest. The Dunfermline Building Society was a tenant of a property I manage on behalf of a pension fund. I am waiting for the application to assign to the Nationwide, but it has not come through yet.</p>

These are the problems that occur if you live long enough. I declare an interest in that many decades ago I was a Dunfermline Building Society manager. I do not intend to repeat the few remarks which I made in the Chamber pre the surveillance of the Statutory Instruments Committee. What I want to say, which follows on from the noble Baroness&#146;s point, is that it is not very clear up there&#151;I live in Scotland&#151;just where we are going with the housing association loan book, which has apparently gone to the Nationwide. On the surface and in public terms, that is a somewhat grey area. If the Minister could be specific on that issue, it would be helpful not only to me and other Members present but to the wider public in Scotland, because the <I>Scotsman</I> newspaper, at least, has tended to publish detailed information.</p>

I offer my rather belated congratulations to the noble Baroness on her birthday yesterday. I had hoped she had had such an uproarious evening yesterday that she would be somewhat blighted today, but no such luck. She is on her usual form. I am therefore obliged to do my very best to answer the detailed questions that she and other noble Lords have asked.

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000090"></a>The noble Baroness asked significant questions and made the obvious comment that the fact that we are in this position indicates that a mistake has been made. That is certainly the case, but I recall some scepticism on the part of the opposition about the necessity of making provision in the Banking Bill, as it then was, to deal with the possibility of errors occurring. After all, we are all aware of the fact that this work is done in&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09062491000091"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09062491000183"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> Will the Minister point me to the <I>Hansard</I> reference where he ever said that Section 75 was going to be used to rectify errors of this nature?</p>

<p><a name="09062491000092"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09062491000184"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Section 75 was a very important provision in the Act. I hope that the noble Baroness will rightly identify that a mistake has been made, which we clearly need to take lessons from&#151;I emphasise that point&#151;and recognise the wisdom of the Act being presented in such a way that we are able to make up for weaknesses, particularly against a background where we all recognise that work is done under considerable pressure. We all know that things have to be done with such dramatic suddenness, given their impact on creditors and depositors of banks and building societies: hence the necessity for prompt action. I accept what the noble Baroness has indicated, which was reinforced by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that this error should not happen at all, and certainly not often. I reassure them that the Bank and the Treasury fully discussed the causes of the error before agreeing to lay this Section 75 order. As I indicated in my opening speech, other possible commercial solutions were canvassed but were decided against.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000093"></a>In any future resolutions the tripartite authorities will continue to work together to ensure that all possible risks to the progress of these transactions are managed as effectively as possible. However, none of us should underestimate the challenge this work presents when one is operating under such time constraints. Of course, I accept, and recognised in my opening comments, that there is justifiable criticism when things go wrong. However, we made provision for that in Section 75. I even said at the time that parties might all have intended to achieve a particular effect, and proceeded on the basis of that intention, but an examination of the instrument may reveal that the text itself was ambiguous or even wrong. In such cases it may be entirely appropriate to correct the drafting with retrospective effect to ensure that the parties who signed up to the resolution are indeed in the position&#151;we all recognise that this is the important point&#151;they intended to be in when they gave their agreement. We were wise enough to appreciate that when people are working under pressure, problems&#151;it might even be a

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000094"></a>The noble Baroness is right that no Minister wants to be in this position so soon after the passing of the Act. It is important that the authorities can give assurances that lessons have been learnt, and I convey those assurances today.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000095"></a>I will come on to the points made by my noble friend Lord Kirkhill in a moment. I am all too well aware of the significance of the Dunfermline Building Society to Scotland, but I hope it will be accepted, in the terms that I have outlined, that it was necessary to take this action which was available under the Act. We hope that that action will not need to be repeated, but we are relieved that we have a framework and that the Act is constructed in such a way that we can address ourselves to problems that we become aware of subsequently.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000096"></a>The noble Baroness asked me a number of questions about the independence of the account. It needs to be held in the name of an independent person because both the Treasury and the Bank of England have some interest in the money, in so far as they are entitled to deduct costs. They are therefore a party to the position, so it is proper that it should be handled by an independent valuer rather than in the organisation.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000097"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about the proceeds from the sale of the social housing book. Consideration is to be paid by Nationwide on completion of the transaction, so it is, I am afraid, subject to commercial confidentiality at this stage. I do not ordinarily shy away from trying to answer her questions to me, but in this particular area I think she will accept my answer.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000098"></a>How is the sale of the bridge bank progressing? The Bank of England announced that it has selected the Nationwide Building Society as the third bidder for the social housing loans and related deposits from housing associations that are held by the bridge bank. This followed a competitive process that was conducted by the Bank of England in accordance with the code of practice issued by Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury under the Banking Act 2009. That is the progress that is being made.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000099"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about valuation principles under Article 11. These are difficult areas for me to respond to immediately at this point. If she will forgive me, I will write to her on this point, not least because the degree of complexity that appears to have been identified in the notes passed to me are such that I do not trust myself to deliver them with the clarity and accuracy that she deserves.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000100"></a>What is happening to the Dunfermline Building Society? As my noble friend Lord Kirkhill indicated, he has a close interest in Scotland&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09062491000101"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09062491000185"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> The Minister is moving on, but I am afraid that I did not hear him answer my questions, which were pretty simple, I thought. Was this matter handled entirely in-house?  I am particularly interested in the legal advice and the legal process followed by the Bank of England legal team. If it was not, were outside lawyers involved? If so, who were they, and what fee did they get? We have had the horrific revelation today that the Treasury

Was it Slaughter and May? If it was, how much did it receive? If the Minister does not have those facts to hand, will he undertake to write to me urgently, please?</p>

<p><a name="09062491000102"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09062491000186"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I do not have those facts to hand; part of the answer to that is that that is the responsibility of the Bank of England, but I will take steps to translate the noble Lord&#146;s questions to the appropriate authority and seek to get an answer for him.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000103"></a>On Dunfermline, I have said that the Bank of England selected Nationwide building society as a preferred bidder for the social house loan. We cannot comment on the outcome of the sales process at this stage, as the commercial transaction is not complete as yet. The Bank of England will provide an update in due course: it is under an obligation to do so and will do so. The proceeds of the sale will of course be paid into the resolution fund by the Bank of England. It will be known as the Dunfermline resolution account. Any consideration received from the sale of the shares in the bridge bank, or any distributions made by the bridge bank, for example, following the sale of the business of the bridge bank or by a liquidator appointed to wind up the bridge bank, will be there. The ultimate beneficiary of the account is Dunfermline.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000104"></a>The Bank of England and the Treasury are entitled to be reimbursed&#151;a point I made to the noble Baroness about their direct interest in the issue. The Treasury will need to decide whether any of those costs should in fact be recovered from the monies in the accounts. Before any costs may be recovered from the account, the cost will have to be certified by the independent valuer appointed by the Treasury to have been reasonably and properly incurred. That is the next stage.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000105"></a>On the question of the valuation of the commercial loan book, that will be a matter for the administrator who will be in receipt of the property should the order be passed here and in the other place. I will relay those questions to the administrator; it will be his task to respond to them. Following our exchanges, I will ensure that in due course he is made aware of them.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000106"></a>I was asked by the noble Baroness whether third-party compensation will be worked out on the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; arrangements, how that will work and how the valuer will treat the business of Dunfermline. The valuer is required to apply the valuation principle in accordance with the Banking Act. Dunfermline entered into the insolvency procedure immediately before the time that the transfer instrument was made. This is a mandatory valuation principle that must be included in a third-party compensation order in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000107"></a>The Government believe that that is the correct position as, in order to enter the special resolution regime, Dunfermline had to be failing to meet its threshold conditions. As such, a bank entering into the special resolution regime will have failed to be a going concern. As it would no longer be able to perform its regulated activities, the threshold conditions are no longer met. In this case, we have decided that it is appropriate that the independent valuer should

The valuer will be able to assess for himself the treatment of any property of Dunfermline.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000108"></a>All in all, we believe that the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; arrangements provide an entirely effective safeguard of creditor interests where the partial property transfer powers have been effected, as in this case. We believe that the provisions set out in Schedule 2 to the order will provide comfort&#151;I know that my noble friend will appreciate this&#151;to the creditors of Dunfermline and, more broadly, will provide an example of how the Government have met our promises about protecting the interests of creditors where the stabilisation tools are exercised. Accordingly, we reassure creditors, banks and building societies.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000109"></a>I cannot emphasise that point strongly enough; we discussed it at considerable length when we considered the Banking Act. We all know that the special resolution procedures and stabilisation tools exercised are difficult, are operated under intense pressure and are of the greatest importance in terms of fairness to creditors while, at the same time, preserving as far as possible the positions of the assets concerned.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000110"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that we have responded to that position effectively in the context of the legislation. I apologise if it looks a little as if I have gone over some old ground today, but the perspicacity of the noble Baroness and the noble Lord leading for the opposition parties during the Banking Bill meant that we looked at some of these issues with great intensity at that time, and although I thought there was a possibility of the special resolution procedures being applied, I did not for one moment imagine that we would be in this situation quite so soon.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000111"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that with regard to both the position that the Government adopted on to the passage of the legislation and the way that we have taken these decisions subsequently, allowing for our obvious embarrassment about the drafting mistake in one of the instruments, most of her anxieties have been allayed.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000112"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09062491000187"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> Before the Minister sits down, he made a handsome offer at the outset that <I>Hansard</I> would be carefully scrutinised and that those questions that were not answered would be answered separately in writing&#151;copied, I hope, to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott. I think he will find that he did not answer a number of questions fully, but there is one that he did not answer at all: why there is a limitation that third-party compensation is paid only if it would have been paid under the European Convention on Human Rights. I did not hear him attempt to respond to that. Because I am being kind today, though, I am happy to have all other questions dealt with in correspondence.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC473"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>first, individual homeowners sell their property at a discount and, secondly, they are offered an agreement to remain in the home as a tenant.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000118"></a>A range of stakeholders, including consumer groups and mortgage industry representatives, have raised concerns about the sale and rent-back market. The main concerns are, first, that these arrangements are often taken up by vulnerable homeowners facing repossession; secondly, that these homeowners may be entering sale and rent-back agreements mistakenly believing that these agreements offer secure tenure in the medium to long term; and, thirdly, that with increasing numbers of homeowners experiencing financial difficulty as a result of the global financial downturn, the scale of the problem is likely to increase.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000119"></a>I will come to the specifics of the order shortly, but it may be useful, given the context that those entering into sale and rent-back agreements are often homeowners facing repossession, if I first take a moment to set out the framework of support that the Government have put in place for homeowners during these difficult times. Statutory regulation of mortgages and credit provides homeowners with important protection and appropriate means of redress. In 2004 the Government extended the scope of FSA regulation to cover first-charge residential mortgages. The FSA&#146;s regime requires lenders to treat their customers fairly and to treat repossession as a last resort. Regulation of other credit business is covered by consumer credit legislation administered by the Office of Fair Trading. The regime has been strengthened by the recent implementation of the Consumer Credit Act 2006.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000120"></a>Regulation of mortgages and credit is supported by the new mortgage pre-action protocol introduced in November last year. This set out clear guidance on what action the courts expect lenders to take before bringing a claim to the courts to help ensure that lenders have tried to discuss and agree alternative courses of action with the borrower.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000121"></a>The Government launched the homeowner mortgage support scheme on 21 April. This new scheme, together with changes to support for mortgage interest and the Government&#146;s mortgage rescue scheme announced in the 2009 Budget, will help homeowners who experience a temporary income shock or lose employment, or are otherwise vulnerable, to remain in their homes. The Government have also taken action to help ensure that every household struggling with debts has access to free and impartial debt advice.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000122"></a>Against this backdrop of support for homeowners, the Government are proposing specific protections for those who may be considering a sale and rent-back agreement, which is the basis of this order. The action follows consideration of the sale and rent-back market by the Office of Fair Trading. In response to stakeholder concerns, in the Budget 2008 the Government asked the OFT to investigate the market and consider appropriate options to strengthen consumer protection. On 14 May last year the OFT announced that it would conduct a formal market study, working to a tight timetable in the light of concerns about this market.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000123"></a>The OFT published its report on 15 October. Its market study found that the potential for severe consumer detriment in connection with sale and rent-back  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC474"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>agreements is unlikely to be addressed through the existing framework of consumer protection, other Government initiatives to help homeowners in difficulty under way at the time of reporting, or by industry self-regulation of the sale and rent-back market. The report recommended that the sale and rent-back market should be regulated by the FSA. At the 2008 Pre-Budget Report, the Government confirmed their intention to consult on this, including extending the scope of FSA regulation.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000124"></a>We published the consultation on 6 February. It sought views on three options: maintaining the existing framework, self regulation and FSA regulation. The consultation also invited views on the proposal for the FSA to put in place its regulatory regime via a two-stage approach. This would involve an interim regulatory regime which would take effect as soon as the statutory changes came into force and a full regulatory regime at a later date, following a full consultation and cost-benefit analysis by the FSA. Alongside the consultation, the FSA published a consultation on an interim regulatory regime so that it would be ready to introduce consumer protection swiftly, if asked. Both consultations closed on 1 May, and the Government published a summary of responses to their consultation on the second of this month. Alongside this, the Government laid before Parliament the order that we are looking at today.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000125"></a>Following consultation, the Government consider that extending the scope of FSA regulation to include sale and rent-back agreements is the most appropriate way of ensuring consumer protections in the sale  and rent-back market. We consider that a two-stage  approach to introducing regulation, including the use of an interim regime, represents an appropriate and proportionate way of balancing quick action to protect consumers with the rights of firms already conducting business in the market.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000126"></a>The order we are debating introduces regulation of sale and rent-back agreements by this two-stage process. Interim regulation will commence on 1 July this year. At the end of the summer, the FSA will consult on rules for its full regime, which will come into force in June next year. Under the interim regime, firms will need to meet FSA threshold conditions, including the requirement to have adequate resources and to be run by fit and proper people. Firms will also have to comply with the principles for businesses and meet a number of systems and controls and conduct of business rules. That is the second stage of the process. The first stage is for almost immediate implementation, provided that the Committee considers the order to be acceptable. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000127"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09062491000193"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the order, to which we will not object. The Government asked the OFT to look at the sale and rent-back market and have based their solution on the advice from the OFT. They have consulted, so they cannot be faulted on those grounds. However, I have to say that I have a tinge of regret that we are unleashing the full might of the FSA&#146;s regulatory powers on a relatively new market, which is of indeterminate size but is certainly highly fragmented, and about which&#151;as the OFT study revealed&#151;we know relatively little. My concern is that the costs,  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC475"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC475</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which are estimated at &#163;8,000 on a one-off basis and &#163;20,000 per year thereafter, may well deter providers of sale and rent-back products.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000128"></a>The Treasury impact assessment is based on 1,000 providers and 5,000 transactions a year&#151;that is, on average, five transactions per provider. If you have to recoup in year one both the set-up and the ongoing costs, you have to recoup more than &#163;5,000 per transaction on average. We have to bear in mind that these transactions concern relatively small amounts and certainly involve homes lower down the valuation scale.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000129"></a>I do not doubt that there have been circumstances in which owners of property have entered into unwise transactions, possibly induced by purchasers to sign up to terms which were unduly favourable to the purchaser and unfair to the owner of the property. However, it is clear from the OFT report that sale and rent-back products can in fact be a suitable response for some people, especially those who are already over-borrowed but who place a high value on remaining in their own home. These are not people who would benefit from the mortgage protection schemes and the like to which the Minister referred. Their problems are too deep-seated to be dealt with by those sorts of protections.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000130"></a>The impact assessment has an impossibly wide range of costs and benefits of the regulatory solution in the order&#151;between net costs of &#163;953 million and benefits of &#163;1,327 million. The Treasury is to be commended for its honesty in revealing the wide range of potential outcomes, but this underlines&#151;for me, at least&#151;the difficulties that we have in justifying a regulatory solution. I instinctively fight shy of a regulatory solution if another solution can be found. I accept, though, that on the basis of the work that is done by the Treasury, no satisfactory self-regulatory system seemed to be available. There is evidence that some consumers have been harmed by sale and rent-back products, but precious little evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, to weigh in the balance on the other side.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000131"></a>My final set of questions to the Minister concerns the future of regulation. We constantly add regulated activities to the FSA, but I do not think that we ever take them away. Will he say whether the Treasury and/or the FSA believes it appropriate to look at the regulated activities that are accreting in the FSA to see whether they continue to be justified over time?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90624-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="90624-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000132"></a>More specifically, does either the Treasury or the FSA believe that it should review the power that has been added in the light of the difficult evidential base behind it and the understanding of what the consequences of regulation might be? Does the Treasury believe that a review would be appropriate after a number of years to see what the impact of this power has been on the availability of finance of different kinds to homeowners? There is a danger that well-intentioned regulation&#151;this is clearly that&#151;could actually kill the market for sale and rent-back entirely, and I am by no means convinced that that is the right outcome for all consumers.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000133"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09062491000194"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> We on these Benches not only do not object to this measure; we positively welcome it. We believe that there is increasing evidence  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC476"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC476</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the sale and rent-back market is becoming a serious scandal. I accept the noble Baroness&#146;s point that the evidence is not very clear&#151;it is a fairly new market&#151;but there is a great deal of evidence that unscrupulous operators are preying on very vulnerable people. In this case, the Government have taken the right decision, and the FSA now needs to step in and regulate this.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000134"></a>How will the safeguards and the protections for people work in practice? Compensation after the event is never as good as preventing a transaction that is not right and preventing a rip-off. Clearly, solicitors have to act on a transaction of this kind. Will the Minister&#151;or, rather, the FSA through him&#151;say whether solicitors have a duty of care to their client to warn them that the transaction into which they are going to enter could be illegal, if the order is passed, or certainly not in their best interest? Will the FSA take steps to ensure that solicitors are put on notice so that it is even a question of professional misconduct if they do not properly advise the client? This is a practical point, particularly as&#151;as the noble Baroness said&#151;we are probably talking about fairly low-value houses in many cases. We want to prevent the abuse, the scandal, from happening at the point of sale rather than having an involved compensation procedure afterwards.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000135"></a>In general, however, we think that regulation is necessary in this case.</p>

<p><a name="09062491000136"></a><b><a name="90624-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09062491000195"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords for their support for the measure. I noted the noble Baroness&#146;s reservations, and I recognise the figures. After all, they are government estimates of the costs. She is absolutely right that this is a question of balance between the cost to those who might provide these opportunities and the particular problem that has been recognised. That came through strongly in consultation, but it was also a reflection of the fact that anxieties have been expressed about this business from a number of quarters, particularly consumers&#146; associations, which highlighted difficulties in this area.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000137"></a>The noble Baroness is absolutely right that we have difficulties with estimating the nature of the business, because it is a recent development with quite quick growth. We cannot produce definitive positions on the size of the business nor directly how the business will react to the costs involved. The consultation gave clear indications as to what was involved. I certainly accept the point made by the noble Baroness about the FSA and regulated activities. I know that the FSA regularly reviews its regime; it is obliged to. The noble Baroness will appreciate that the FSA has been under considerable pressure of public scrutiny in recent months, not to say the past few years. Of course we expect the FSA to keep its regulation under review and to make sure that its actions are appropriate and proportionate. I can give assurances on that front, and that full consultation occurred before the orders were drafted.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000138"></a>There is the additional dimension of care. The issue is serious enough for us to want to act promptly&#151;that is why we have the interim position&#151;but we are all too well aware of the fact that the costs involved and the situation is such that before the full regulatory regime comes into place, a month should elapse for people to adjust to that market. The noble Baroness used a  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC477"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC477</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>phrase that I would ordinarily have sought to use: it is a question of striking a balance between protecting the vulnerable consumer, of whom we have notice of sufficient numbers, and ensuring that provision is made to help homeowners&#151;provided that consumers are fully aware of their rights. I entirely accept what the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said: it is important that the best advice is available. We are talking about low-income families. I am in no doubt about the obligation on the solicitor; I have more doubts perhaps about the relationship between the solicitor and people who are probably carrying out the first or second transaction of their lives of such import. When one is dealing with a new concept, with the best consumer advice in the world, one is all too well aware that an awful lot of people remain in comparative ignorance of their rights.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000139"></a>I emphasise that none of us thinks that this strategy ought to obtain in very large numbers of cases. We can see the growth of the industry. With safeguards, it may be that it provides support and help to some, but we all know that sale and leaseback will not be appropriate in some cases. We know already of cases where complaints have been registered&#151;and the complaints have been about the most fundamental thing: &#147;We did not appreciate that we had lost the capacity to safeguard our home&#148;. I cannot think of a more fundamental right than that.  


<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC478"></a><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column GC478</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>If the Consumers&#146; Association is telling us that cases are emerging where people are in that situation, it shows how seriously we must address safeguards for the consumer.</p>

<a name="90624-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062491000140"></a>All the points that both noble Lords made about the legislation are important. It is important that the potential costs involved do not choke off supplies of what may be a service to the consumer. Awareness of rights and the ability to conduct transactions with professional advice need the greatest consideration. The FSA should not, because this may be a relatively small market at present, neglect its obligations to control this market; it must take those responsibilities seriously. As we all recognise, the FSA is carrying some most significant burdens and some others which affect a much smaller percentage of the population. I entirely accept that it must act in the most professional way with regard to its regulatory regime. It certainly needs to review those powers if its effectiveness is adversely affected by the amount of work that it has taken on. We all know the strengthening of the professionalism of the FSA that has gone on in recent months. We will need to ensure that that is properly supervised. I commend the order.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09062490000004"></a>The Statement by my predecessor, the Member for Coventry North East (Bob Ainsworth) on 25 February 2009 (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. 24-25WS) referred to a delay from spring until summer 2009 of the deployment of Tornado GR4 aircraft to replace a broadly similar force of Harrier GR9 aircraft at Kandahar airfield, Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09062490000005"></a>I can confirm that necessary supporting infrastructure at Kandahar is now in place and all Tornado GR4 urgent operational requirement enhancements have been delivered.  Consequently Tornado GR4 aircraft deployed to Kandahar in mid-June and, after a period of joint operations with the Harrier force, today the Tornado GR4 force has taken over sole responsibility for RAF fast-jet support in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09062490000006"></a>The transition from Harrier to Tornado in theatre has been seamless.  During the handover the Tornado force has proved that it is fully capable of fulfilling all the roles required of it in support of coalition ground forces.  Those forces will continue to benefit from the flexibility and broad range of capabilities offered by UK fast-jet aircraft.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09062490000007"></a>The remaining elements of the Harrier force are preparing to leave Kandahar shortly, with the final Harrier personnel planning to return to their home base at RAF Cottesmore in early July.  Joint Force Harrier has made a significant and acclaimed contribution to coalition air operations during its four and a half years&#146; service in Afghanistan and the personnel within this force can be proud of all their many achievements in this operational theatre.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09062490000022"></a>I am pleased to announce that a feasibility study will be undertaken to look at the possibility of establishing a defence and national rehabilitation centre in around 10 years&#146; time, looking at how the whole issue of rehabilitation should be developed in 21st century terms. The study will build on the remarkable achievements of the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court in Surrey, and exploit what we and others have learnt in recent times about complex injury.  It will look at doing so in the context of creating a national centre for civilian as well as military rehabilitation.  We shall also look at the inclusion of rehabilitation research, the potential for developing further our world class paralympic athletes and a train the trainer capability for rehabilitation in conflict and post-conflict afflicted states.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09062490000024"></a>The Government are committed to delivering state-of-the-art treatment for our injured service personnel.  They deserve nothing but the best.  The MoD continues to invest in DMRC at Headley Court to ensure its provision of world-class care.  We would only envisage leaving Headley Court if there were an assured level of future care that surpassed even that which is offered by DMRC&#146;s current and planned capabilities.</p>

To that end, a defence-led study is under way to consider how to make the best possible provision in this area, starting with a pathfinder centre near Edinburgh, in conjunction with the charities Erskine Homes and Help for Heroes.  The pathfinder will enable us to learn lessons, which will help inform our judgment about how best to provide convalescent care in the future and help prepare wounded, injured and sick personnel to return to duty or transition to civilian life.</p>

The policy document draws together the key ongoing and planned work to enable large-scale deployment of offshore wind, as well as setting out the next steps. A copy of this document will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09062490000031"></a>In 2006, DECC initiated a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) on a draft plan/programme to hold further rounds of offshore oil and gas licensing, including licensing of gas storage in hydrocarbon reservoirs, and some 25GW of additional offshore wind leasing in United Kingdom waters. The SEA is documented on a dedicated website (<a href="http://www.offshore-sea.org.uk">www.offshore-sea.org.uk</a>) and includes a range of field surveys, technical studies and syntheses of data commissioned to underpin the SEA assessment. For offshore (seaward) oil and gas licensing and for offshore gas storage licensing the SEA covered all UK waters. For offshore wind leasing, the SEA covered those parts of the UK renewable energy zone and the territorial waters of England and Wales where the water depth is around 60 metres or less. The Scottish Executive and Northern Ireland Executive are the competent authorities for conducting strategic environmental assessments (SEAs) within their territorial waters. Both of these authorities are currently undertaking SEAs for the purposes of enabling offshore wind leasing in these areas.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09062490000032"></a>An expert assessment workshop was held to consider the key issues to be addressed in assessing the draft plan/programme. In addition, three sector-specific workshops and three wider stakeholder workshops were also held to gather industry perspectives and stakeholder input on relevant issues. The results of these workshops were assessed further and documented in an environmental report which then formed the basis for statutory, public and international consultation. In January 2009, the three-month consultation period on DECC&#146;s draft plan/programme and environmental report commenced and was advertised in a number of local and national newspapers and by e-mail notification to a wide range of individuals and organisations.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09062490000033"></a>All responses received from consultees on the draft plan/programme and the environmental report have been considered by DECC and a post-consultation report for the offshore energy SEA has been prepared and placed on the SEA website today. This summarises consultee comments and DECC responses to them, and presents a final list of recommendations, some of which have been revised following feedback from consultees. The full texts of consultee comments have also been placed on the SEA website.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09062490000034"></a>DECC has now fully considered the conclusions and recommendations of the offshore energy SEA environmental report together with feedback received from consultees. In the light of the final recommendations set out in the post-consultation report, the department concludes that there are no overriding environmental considerations to prevent the achievement of our draft plan/programme of leasing for offshore wind, and licensing of oil and gas production, and gas storage, if mitigation measures are implemented to prevent, reduce and offset significant adverse effects.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09062490000035"></a>In all cases, the relevant competent authority will undertake any appropriate assessment(s) prior to awarding licences or leases under the rounds, if required following screening. This is required under EU Council Directive 79/409 EEC on the conservation of wild birds and Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora, and UK implementing regulations.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09062490000036"></a>Monitoring the potentially significant environmental effects identified within the SEA will be undertaken using existing mechanisms and those to be set up under the auspices of the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) and Marine Management Organisation (MMO).</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09062490000037"></a>For offshore wind, the Crown Estate is the leasing authority and can now proceed with offshore wind leasing competition(s). Within UK waters, the Government have decided that there should be spatial restrictions on offshore wind development in specific geographic areas as indicated in the recommendations of the post-consultation report. These spatial restrictions are issue- and criteria-based, including for example military practice and exercise areas, airspace danger areas and International Maritime Organisation routes. As these boundaries and locations may change over time, the maps contained in the environmental report are indicative.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09062490000038"></a>As the offshore wind policy document, <I>A Prevailing Wind</I><I>,</I> published today makes clear, the Government, and DECC in particular, will have a continuing role to play in facilitating policy interventions necessary to help deliver the offshore wind element of our plan/programme. DECC, with the Crown Estate, has a cross-departmental offshore wind delivery board to develop and oversee this work.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09062490000039"></a>For oil and gas, DECC will now proceed with preparations for a further round&#151;the 26th&#151;of offshore licensing. This is expected to be launched early next year&#151;a further announcement will be made on the timing of the round.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09062490000040"></a>For offshore gas storage, DECC will be the licensing authority and the Crown Estate will be the leasing authority, working in parallel with each other. DECC is currently considering the responses to the recent consultation on the proposed offshore gas storage and unloading licensing scheme. DECC will issue the Government response in due course, indicating how the licensing scheme is to go forward.</p>

<a name="09062490000044"></a><b><a name="90624-wms0001.htm_spmin6"></a><a name="09062490000101"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Ann Keen) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09062490000045"></a>I announced in my Written Ministerial Statement on13 March 2009 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 36WS), that we had asked the independent Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening (ACCS) to formally review the evidence relating to risks and benefits of cervical screening in women under 25 years, including current evidence regarding incidence and mortality in young women.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09062490000046"></a>The review took place at an extraordinary meeting of the ACCS held on 19 May 2009. The ACCS is an independent ministerially appointed committee, with most members nominated by their respective professional bodies. A number of guests were also invited to the review meeting to ensure all opinions and available evidence were heard, including the voluntary sector and patients.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09062490000047"></a>No new scientific evidence was presented to the review meeting to support the reintroduction of screening in women under 25. Indeed some new evidence was presented indicating that screening is of little or no benefit in women in this age group. There is evidence that treatment following screening in this age group can lead to an increased risk of subsequent premature births, increasing the risk of babies dying or having severe disabilities. Evidence was also presented that showed there has been no significant increase in the number of women aged under 25 contracting or dying from cervical cancer since the policy change in 2004.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09062490000048"></a>Members of the committee were unanimous that there was no reason to lower the age at which screening commences, which is in line with international recommendations.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09062490000049"></a>Members of the committee were, however, concerned that young women who present to their general practitioners with gynaecological symptoms are not always being given appropriate advice. They strongly recommended that the Department of Health should take further action in this area, and the ACCS will be considering how best to take this forward as a matter of urgency at its meeting on 25 June 2009. Members also recommended that more effort is made in increasing the uptake of cervical screening in women aged 25 to 34, where coverage has been falling in recent years. We will develop plans with NHS cancer screening programmes and the national awareness and early diagnosis initiative to take this forward.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="09062490000050"></a>The committee will keep the decision closely under review, especially by monitoring the incidence of cervical cancer in young women.

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="09062490000061"></a>I have today published a consultation paper on the recommendations of the Consultative Group on the Past. Dealing with the legacy of the events of the past 40 years remains one of the greatest challenges still facing Northern Ireland. The Consultative Group on the Past was established in 2007 and asked to make recommendations about steps that might be taken to support Northern Ireland society in building a shared future that is not overshadowed by the events of the past.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="09062490000062"></a>When the report was published, one recommendation &#151;that &#163;12,000 recognition payments should be made to the relatives of all those who died as a result of the Troubles&#151;dominated all discussion of the report, and overshadowed all the other 30 recommendations.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="09062490000063"></a>I have already confirmed that the Government do not propose to take this recommendation forward. However, I am concerned that there has not yet been a thorough debate about the other recommendations in the report. That is why the consultation paper I am publishing today invites everyone to study all of the recommendations carefully and share with the Government their views on each of them.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="09062490000064"></a>In particular, I am calling on the political leaders in Northern Ireland to engage fully in a study of the proposals. The way forward cannot be imposed on Northern Ireland; it must be based on emerging and wide-ranging consensus. Achieving that consensus will not be easy but I believe that if the recommendations are studied carefully there will be those that will have widespread support.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="09062490000068"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice and I have today presented to Parliament the Parliamentary Standards Bill.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="09062490000069"></a>We are grateful for the constructive cross-party discussions that preceded the Bill&#146;s introduction. This Bill is the first stage of legislation and covers the specific but important and urgent task of setting up an independent authority. There is likely to be subsequent legislation where this is judged necessary, not least in the light of further cross-party discussions.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="09062490000070"></a>The Bill will create a new independent parliamentary standards authority (IPSA) to regulate the system of allowances, set rules to deal with financial interests and put the requirement for a code of conduct for MPs on a statutory footing.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="09062490000071"></a>The IPSA will be independent of Parliament and will have the power to set an allowances and expenses system without requiring parliamentary approval. It will regulate and oversee Members&#146; expense claims and oversee the new allowance system.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="09062490000072"></a>The Bill will establish a commissioner for parliamentary investigations who will have the power to conduct investigations and report to the IPSA. The IPSA will be able when necessary to direct those who have received allowances they were not entitled to to repay money. In addition the IPSA will be able to direct an MP to amend his or her entries in the register of financial interests.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="09062490000073"></a>The IPSA will be able to recommend that the House exercises its disciplinary powers to withhold a salary for a specified period, suspend a Member from the House for a specified period or expel a Member from the House.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="09062490000074"></a>The IPSA also has the power to refer matters to the police. The Bill will create new criminal offences of:</p>
 knowingly providing false or misleading information in a claim for an allowance, for which the maximum sanction is up to 12 months&#146; custodial sentence or an unlimited fine;failing without reasonable excuse to comply with the rules on registration, for which the maximum penalty is a fine of up to &#163;5,000; andbreaching the rules which prohibit paid advocacy, for which the maximum penalty is a fine of up to &#163;5,000.The IPSA will work transparently and the Freedom of Information Act will apply both to the IPSA and to the commissioner for parliamentary investigations.
<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="09062490000075"></a>The IPSA will be made up of four members and a chair. Selection to the authority will be on merit and by fair and open competition. A candidate for appointment as the chair or as a member must be selected by the Speaker of the House of Commons with the agreement of the Speaker&#146;s committee set up by the Bill </p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="09062490000076"></a>The Bill, together with Explanatory Notes, is available to Members from the Vote Office.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="09062490000080"></a>The Government are determined to ensure that everything possible is done to maintain the integrity and reputation of sport. I am therefore delighted to announce that I am bringing together a new Sports Betting Integrity Panel under the chairmanship of Rick Parry. This panel will include representatives of the betting industry; sports governing bodies; players; the Gambling Commission and the police. The panel&#146;s main focus will be the design and implementation of an integrated strategy to uphold integrity in sports and associated betting.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="09062490000081"></a>The vast majority of sports betting is legal and fair, and enhances the enjoyment of sport for many fans. But betting also provides an opportunity and an incentive for corrupting sport through the use of unfair or illegal betting practices.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="09062490000082"></a>The Government are concerned that, although considerable progress has been made in recent years by sports governing bodies, the betting industry and the Gambling Commission, the possible threat to the integrity of sport remains an ever-present and complex problem requiring multi-agency solutions. If the UK is to maintain its reputation as a jurisdiction where fair play is the guiding principle for both sport and betting, it is vital that the risks of corruption arising from all sources are reduced as far as possible.</p>

<a name="90624-wms0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="09062490000083"></a>The sports themselves: governing bodies, clubs and players; the betting industry; and enforcement authorities, principally the Gambling Commission and the police, all play important roles. To help co-ordinate the work of those parties, and to facilitate collaboration between them, the panel will bring together key people from the principal organisations involved, under the chairmanship of Rick Parry, to look at these issues and make recommendations on how the various bodies concerned can work together more effectively.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="09062476000005"></a>In 2008, the Learning and Skills Council commissioned research by BMG Research, using a survey of apprentices, into the benefits of completing an apprenticeship. This research concluded that apprenticeships do not particularly nor generally fail any major group of apprentices who complete the programme, but showed a clear gender bias in participation in sectors where this would be expected from the labour force in general. While the apprenticeship experience appears a little more positive for BME apprentices in terms of motivation and confidence, BME apprentices are less likely to have employed status and more likely to have returned

All export licence applications, including any for Sri Lanka, are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria (which incorporates the EU Code of Conduct). Assessments of applications take account of all available information at the time of the application, including information about the situation in the receiving country, the capability and stated end use of the goods, and the past behaviour of the end user. Licences will not be issued if the proposed exports would be inconsistent with any of the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. In particular, a licence will not be issued if there is a clear risk that the goods would be used for internal repression, would provoke or prolong armed conflict or would aggravate existing tensions within the recipient country.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a><a name="09062476000018"></a>As a result of the review, the department will produce recommendations to Ministers on possible enhancements to the work capability assessment. If changes are made to account for adaptation, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of people considered able to look for a range of jobs straight away and thus be eligible for jobseeker's allowance.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a><a name="09062476000019"></a>We plan to finish the review in the summer, and its findings and proposals will be reported shortly afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a><a name="09062476000020"></a>The department is also committed to an annual independent review of the work capability assessment. This statutory and ongoing requirement&#151;set out in the Welfare Reform Act 2007&#151;is focused specifically on the operation of the assessment against Sections 8 and 9 of the Act; that is the assessments of limited capability for work and limited capability for work related activity.</p>

<a name="90624w0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a><a name="09062476000021"></a>The internal review is a one-off technical evaluation of the criteria involved in assessing entitlement to ESA. It is normal that the department evaluates new policy initiatives in this way. The independent review is an ongoing annual requirement to allow parliamentary scrutiny of the effectiveness of the policy in meeting its stated aims. While the reviews will inevitably cover some of the same ground, the nature of review activity may be different.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_120"></a><a name="09062476000138"></a>Under Rule 54(1) of the European parliamentary election rules, the local returning officer is required to consider any request for a recount but may refuse if in their opinion a recount is unreasonable. If a recount is granted, the local returning officer is required to conduct the count under the same procedure as the original count. The Electoral Commission has issued guidance on the procedure which local returning officers should follow for recounts. This includes advising local returning officers to consult the regional returning officer if a recount is required. There is no statutory provision  for recounts to take place at regional levels. Under  the terms of Section 5 of the Political Parties,  Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the Electoral Commission must prepare and publish a report on the administration of European parliamentary elections in the UK. The Government will consider the findings of the Commission's report.</p>
