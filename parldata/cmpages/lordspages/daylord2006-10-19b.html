the UK played a full and positive role in the negotiations both in its

and I pay tribute to him for his work. I also pay tribute to the noble
Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, who opened a debate in your
Lordships&#146; House on this matter in 2000. The UK Government have
always enthusiastically supported the development of a charter, a
treaty, and we are checking with all government departments to ensure
that current legislation is compatible with the wording of the treaty.
Of course, as soon as we can sign it, we will wish to do so. As for
international co-operation and help, yes, of course we wish to do
everything we can to encourage other nations to ensure that the terms
of the treaty are implemented.</p><p><a name="06101925000020"></a><b><a name="61019-0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="06101925001665"></a>Baroness

work has been changed? There has been quite a glitch which in some
cases has meant that people have been hard pushed to find the money to
go to work. Is this happening only in government departments or is it a
general thing? Has it come from the Minister&#146;s department so
that everyone with a disability who travels to work is
affected?</p><p><a name="06101925000021"></a><b><a name="61019-0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="06101925001666"></a>Lord

Baroness is referring to the Access to Work programme. Perhaps I may
write to her with more details. It is not exactly covered by the UN
treaty, but we are very keen to help disabled people who wish to go
back to work to do so. In the past nine years, the proportion of
disabled people in work has risen by about 8 per cent; we are keen to
see the figure increase and will do everything possible to support
that.</p><p><a name="06101925000022"></a><b><a name="61019-0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="06101925001667"></a>Baroness
Masham of Ilton:</b> My Lords, does the Minister

Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, the House has
debated this matter on a number of occasions. Of course the Government
wish to ensure that any soldier injured on active duty is given the
best treatment possible, both short term and long term. I pay tribute
to the work of Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham; I know it well, and it
is doing outstanding work. Wider issues about the charter and the
degree to which disability legislation applies to the Armed Forces have
been well covered. The Government decided not to cover members of the
Armed Forces in disability legislation because all Armed Forces
personnel need to be in combat effectively to meet a worldwide
liability to deploy. But in answer to the substantive question, it is
very important that we provide the right
services.</p><p><a name="06101925000024"></a><b><a name="61019-0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="06101925001669"></a>Lord

Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, there are two
points here. With regard to the UK, we are confident that there will
not be too many problems with our own domestic legislation as it is at
present in relation to the terms of the treaty. Of course, we must go
through a detailed process and that is being done at the moment. That
debate is better had when we have completed that work. We are very keen
to move quickly and we want sign up. Of course, there are issues on
which reservations may need to be expressed, but it is best for us to
do the detailed
work.</p><p><a name="06101925000026"></a>As for
other countries, the UK&#146;s aid programme has increased enormously
and will continue to increase in the next few years. Clearly there will
be elements of disability programmes in that aid
programme.</p>

for Disability Issues, which is a cross-government approach to
encourage independent living and ensure that disabled people receive as
much support as they can. The office is very much concerned with that

work within the UN, the agreement has been reached and the text is now
subject to a technical committee to ensure that the terms of the
agreement are consistent with other human rights treaties that the UN
has already agreed to. My hope is that that can all be done very
quickly, and that the General Assembly can come to a vote on this
before the end of the year. It will then be up to individual countries
to decide to sign up. When 20 countries have so signed, the treaty
comes into force 30 days after the 20th country has signed
up.</p><p><a name="06101925000031"></a><b><a name="61019-0001.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="06101925001675"></a>Lord

good question, and I am sure that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
would be delighted to supply further information. For the record, I am
told that there is no definitive list of treaties that are in force for
the UK. The FCO&#146;s treaty database, which provides details of all
treaties since 1835 to which the UK is or has been a party, has some
14,000 records. Some of those treaties may no longer be in force. The
continuing validity of a treaty is considered on a case-by-case basis,

Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, of course a great
deal of expenditure is incurred by these private organisations to
increase their business. That goes without saying. The Government have
a role in co-ordinating activity, however, and recognising where there
are opportunities. It would be remiss of the Government, when we are
just a few short years away from the Olympic Games, to suggest that we
have no interest at all in the huge tourism opportunities that may
develop from that year. We recognise that tourism is a very important
industry in this country, and a judicious amount of limited government
funds is advisable.</p><p><a name="06101925000039"></a><b><a name="61019-0001.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="06101925001683"></a>Lord

acknowledge that, although this party, the Labour Party, was the first
to develop a tourism Act and so co-ordinate all those elements that are
needed to promote inward tourism to the United Kingdom, VisitBritain

resources with which increased numbers of visitors could be welcomed to
these countries, providing jobs and occupations for our
people?</p><p><a name="06101925000040"></a><b><a name="61019-0001.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="06101925001684"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, more money can always
be spent. That goes without saying. Organisations with a track record
of success have the right to make demands and to hope that their
budgets will be increased, but all that has to be within a framework of
national expenditure. Of course tourism will depend overwhelmingly on
private provision, for transport, hotels, facilities and tourist
attractions; it is an industry overwhelmingly in private hands to meet
the demands of the market. The Government can, however, make judicious
use of resources to help. As far as VisitBritain is concerned, we are
talking about only &#163;35 million; we are not talking about huge
demands on the Exchequer.</p>

noble Lord, Lord Harrison, this Government have done great things in
co-ordinating tourism effort and getting more people to visit this
country. The fact is that our tourism earnings are in deficit and there
is no co-ordination overseas among the various bodies that are trying
to promote Britain. VisitBritain is one such body, but how many British
organisations are now promoting tourists to come to Britain in the
United States? It is not just

go abroad. That is a choice of British citizens and a reflection of
their resources and earning power. But even in the year of the London
bombings we increased incoming tourism by 8 per cent. That is a record
of which all the organisations concerned, private and public, can be
proud.</p>

falsely accused by a serial and repeated liar, Shannon Taylor, who has
a history of making false accusations and having multiple identities?
As a result of her accusations he spent three and a half years in
prison following a shabby and inadequate police investigation and was

inevitable that people will be falsely accused. One of the tragedies of
rape allegations is that very few of those who suffer this most
dreadful crime have the courage to come forward at all. The issues with

per cent, compared with an average of 40 per cent in murder

1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 came into force? If not, is that not
another example of highly controversial legislation in the criminal

cent of recorded rapes result in a conviction. That is a level of which
none of us should feel proud if the allegations have been properly put
forward and dealt with. As the noble and learned Lord will be aware,
the current legislation has been in place for only a relatively short
period. It is too soon to make an accurate evaluation of the impact of

assault. Some studies have shown that in up to 81 per cent of rape and
sexual assault cases the victim has been drinking before the assault,
and the perpetrators have shown a significant issue in relation to that
too. In relation to alcohol, there is also the spiking of
drinks.</p><p><a name="06101925000061"></a><b><a name="61019-0001.htm_spnew44"></a><a name="06101925001705"></a>Lord

Most rapists in this country get away scot-free and are able to
maintain their anonymity. There are an estimated 80,000 incidents of
rape or attempted rape. What measures will be in the report to help
women in bringing forward complaints of rape and to ensure that they
will be given all the help, support, advice and aid that they need so
that rapists pay the price for their terrible crime against
women?</p><p><a name="06101925000067"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew50"></a><a name="06101925001711"></a>Baroness

this issue. The Government&#146;s consultation dealt with four
issues. First, does the law on capacity need to be changed? Secondly,
should prosecutors be allowed to present expert evidence concerning the
crime of rape in general? Thirdly, should evidence of complaint that is
not recent be admitted? And, fourthly, should changes be made to the
special measures provisions? All those issues may impact on our ability
to accurately identify those who have perpetrated rape and bring them
to justice. The results of that consultation will come soon and our
work on sexual assault referral centres is making a helpful
impact.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61019-0002.htm_wqn0"></a><a name="06101925000007"></a>Iraq:

that 92 per cent of the respondents in the survey produced death

Hopkins University; I have no doubt about their abilities in that
sense. What does disturb me a good deal is the extent to which this is
a very high estimate compared with others in which the methodology is
also regarded as really pretty good. For those reasons it is extremely
difficult to arrive at a sensible conclusion. I believe that the
Government of Iraq&#151;assisted by the Medico-Legal Institute, which
itself is assisted by the International Committee of the Red
Cross&#151;and the UN human rights officials who compile a report and
are on the ground, still have a very effective operation. I would be
loath to try to judge which set of figures is right or to believe that
we could do a better job than those who are
there.</p><p><a name="06101925000072"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew55"></a><a name="06101925001716"></a>Lord

done very well, but we don&#146;t think that it is worth very
much&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101925000073"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew56"></a><a name="06101925001717"></a>Lord

arrived at very different figures and that those methods also are
legitimate. The way in which data are extrapolated from samples to a
general outcome is a matter of deep concern and merits considerable
study rather than the denunciation of one method compared with
another.</p><p><a name="06101925000074"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew57"></a><a name="06101925001718"></a>Lord

geographical and regional variations suggest that the south is
relatively less prone to the numbers of deaths occurring in some other
areas, although the figures probably depend on how you define the

Institute and the UN human rights figures are 3,000 a month, but the
bases on which those figures are compiled also have methodological
flaws.</p>

gain access right across the country. We are bound to rely to some
extent on research methods employed either more generally or, as I have

Washington a change of strategy to halt some of the endless bloodshed?
Can he assure us that, if this is the new situation, the United Kingdom

School improvement partners shall send to the relevant local education
authority copies of any reports made by them on relevant schools within
the local education authority's
area.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06101925000086"></a>The
noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 11.
These two amendments deal with school improvement partners. We had a
lengthy debate about this matter in Committee. During that debate, we
established that, although appointments are nominally by the Secretary
of State, local authorities will be responsible for appointing local
school improvement partners to schools in their areas with the
exceptions of academies, city technology colleges and city colleges for
the technology of the arts. A school improvement partner will be
primarily accountable to the employing local authority. Accreditation
will be through the National College for School Leadership, which will
share with local authorities responsibility for the training and
continuous professional development of school improvement
partners.</p><p><a name="06101925000087"></a>We
also established that school improvement partners will be expected to
spend about five days a year working with the schools with which they
are partnered, but typically a SIP may have three or four schools under
its wings and therefore give an average of something like 19 days a
year to the job. They would be paid by local authorities, which would
no longer have to fund the link adviser. So the extra money that the
Government are putting into the system&#151;some &#163;21
million&#151;is on top of the &#163;7 million already spent on link
advisers by local education authorities. Therefore, the rate of pay is
somewhat greater than the back-of-the-envelope calculation put forward
by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, which meant that they would get little
more than school dinner ladies, &#163;6.50 an hour&#151;I think it
goes up a little but not that
much.</p><p><a name="06101925000088"></a>Nevertheless, doubts have
remained about the funding of school improvement partners: how much
will local authorities have to pay to encourage former head teachers
out of the retirement bunker, and how could and should the possible
conflicts between heads and school improvement partners be resolved?
However, today's amendment does not address either of those concerns.
Instead it addresses what in many respects is a minor issue about which
the Minister spoke <I>en passant</I> in the previous debate; namely,
the relationship between local authorities, academies, city technology
colleges and city colleges for the technology of the arts in relation
to SIPS.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_874"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 874</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101925000089"></a>In one of the amendments
that we tabled in Committee, we suggested that local authorities should
be responsible for appointing all school improvement partners including
those to academies and city technology colleges. The Minister responded
very firmly. In law, those are independent state schools and,
therefore, we feel it would be inappropriate for local authorities to
appoint their improvement partners. That is not to say that the
external accountability of those publicly funded schools is any less
important.</p><p><a name="06101925000090"></a>The two amendments
that we have tabled today do not question the fact that the Secretary
of State will appoint school improvement partners; however, we ask that
the reports made by school improvement partners should be made
available to local education authorities. At present, school
improvement partners for academies, city technology colleges, and so
forth, report only to the Secretary of State. We put this amendment
forward on behalf of the LGA, which believes that if councils are to
fulfil their proposed new strategic role, which includes ensuring the
education potential of all children in their areas, that must include
children attending academies and other centrally directed and funded
schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000091"></a>The performance of
those schools will be reflected in the education element of the local
authorities&#146; annual performance assessments. If local
authorities are genuinely to champion children's educational
well-being, the school improvement partner reports for academies and
city technology colleges should be copied to their authorities so that
they can be challenged and assisted, as provision would be for any
parent or child locally. The school improvement partner reports cover
all the <I>Every Child Matters </I>outcomes, for which a local
authority is responsible for delivering to parents and children. Lack
of information about the performance and the needs of the academies
could lead to inappropriate or inadequate conclusions being drawn about
other neighbouring schools and the authority-wide improvement needs of
the
children.</p><p><a name="06101925000092"></a>This
is a very modest amendment asking only that local education authorities
should have a copy of the reports delivered by school improvement
partners to the Secretary of State in their function as being
answerable to the Secretary of State. I hope that the Minister will
look sympathetically on it. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101925000093"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew66"></a><a name="06101925001727"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, as the noble Baroness has said,
Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 are wholly unnecessary for maintained
schools. School improvement partners of those schools work under
contract to the relevant local education authority and it is
inconceivable for the contract not to provide for the sending of
reports to the authority as client. Therefore, no specific statutory
requirement is
needed.</p><p><a name="06101925000094"></a>In
respect of the other schools that Amendment No. 11 would class as
relevant, academies, as the noble Baroness said, are accountable
directly to the DfES for performance. Accordingly, their school
improvement partners are contracted to the DfES, but because we are
introducing the school improvement partners programme nationally, we
regarded it as equally important 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_875"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 875</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the programme should apply to academies too. School improvement
partners of academies work in broadly the same way as those of
maintained schools, share the same national support arrangements and
are subject to the same national accreditation requirements.</p><p><a name="06101925000095"></a>Amendment No. 10
would introduce a statutory requirement into these non-statutory
arrangements. It would require SIPs of all relevant schools to send
copies of any reports they make to the relevant local education
authority. The Government obviously want co-operation across each local
authority area among schools of all types listed in Amendment No. 11,
but statute is not necessary for this purpose. There is, for example, a
local authority representative on the governing body of every academy,
and that representation is specified in the academy&#146;s articles
of association. The local authority therefore has a means to secure
those reports, even if they are not directly made available. The noble
Baroness&#146;s aims are therefore adequately
secured.</p><h5><a name="06101925000929"></a>11.45

a statutory responsibility. You could rely on the informal links
through having a councillor sitting on the governing body of the

improvement partner would see the local authority as one of the
partnership groups to which it would naturally send the
report.</p><p><a name="06101925000097"></a>This is an extremely
modest amendment, merely asking that local authorities should have a

conceivably bring it back at Third Reading. I am not totally happy with

by regulations providing for the promoter to be relieved of the duty to
implement approved proposals are the provisions dealing with closing
schools as well as those relating to opening them.</p><p><a name="06101925000111"></a>Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 remove the
exemption for land which is defined as publicly funded under the
provisions of Schedule 4. They avoid double jeopardy on this claim for
proceeds of disposal by ensuring that these provisions have force only
after the disposal provisions of Schedule 22 of the School Standards
and Framework Act 1998, as amended by this Bill, have been
applied.</p><p><a name="06101925000112"></a>Amendment No. 25
corrects an omission from the wording of the Bill. It provides that
regulations made under Clause 24, affecting alterations to schools, may
make provision corresponding to that made in regulations under
paragraphs 21 to 31 of Schedule 2, as well as that made in Schedule 2
itself.</p><p><a name="06101925000113"></a>Amendment No. 34 is
similarly technical. The Secretary of State has a power to modify trust
deeds relating to foundation, voluntary and foundation special schools
in connection with the operation of the provisions of the 1998, 2000
and 2002 Education Acts. This amendment gives the Secretary of State
the same power in relation to the provisions of this Bill. Amendments
Nos. 20, 35, 36 and 37 update the reference to
&#147;promoters&#148; in the School Standards and Framework Act
1998, to take account of the fact that provisions of that Act continue
in Wales, but are replaced by the provisions of this Bill in
England.</p><p><a name="06101925000114"></a>On
Amendments Nos. 41 to 44, in Committee, the right reverend Prelates the
Bishop of Peterborough and the Bishop of Southwell reminded us that
there are situations where parents might find it helpful to invite
people other than parents of current pupils on to the parent council.
These amendments allow that to happen. However, we want parents to take
ownership of the parent council, so parent members must consent to the
appointment of a non-parent member, and member and parent members of
registered pupils must always be the majority on the parent council.
Many schools already have successful parent councils with some
non-parent members. We do not want to upset arrangements that are
already working well or prevent people making a valuable contribution
to their local school because they do not currently have a child at
that school, hence these amendments. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101925000115"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew69"></a><a name="06101925001730"></a>The

proportion of elected parent governors on a school's governing
body&#148;<p><a name="06101925000122"></a>The
noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 21, I shall
speak also to Amendments Nos. 39 and 40. Amendment No. 21 prevents a
foundation reducing the current statutory level of elected parent
governors on the board of a school when it becomes a foundation. Power
in a school resides in the governing body, not in the parent councils
that the Government are introducing. The governors have legal powers,
which is why we think it is important&#151;to the Government&#146;s
agenda, as well as ours&#151;to involve parents in the education of
their children in a meaningful way and not to reduce the number of
parents freely and democratically elected by other parents to take part
in decision-making about the running of the school.</p><p><a name="06101925000123"></a>The House will realise that this
amendment is a repeat of an amendment we tabled in Committee, and we
have returned it because we are not satisfied with the
Government&#146;s reasons for rejecting it. In Committee, the
Minister said:</p><ul><a name="06101925000768"></a>&#147;The
model of governance that we propose for parents is precisely that which
currently applies in many thousands of voluntary-aided schools, which
are perfectly adequately managed within the state
system&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/7/06; col.
1231.]</ul><a name="06101925000705"></a>He
went on to say how popular such schools are. I have no doubt of that,
but we are dealing with a step-change in the number of schools that he
proposes should be governed in this way. There are currently only 4,288
voluntary-aided primary and secondary schools in England and Wales, and
the Government are hoping that many thousands of the remaining
maintained schools will enthusiastically take up their invitation to
become foundation schools. Currently, one can expect a certain amount
of homogeneity and consensus of opinion in the parent body of a
voluntary-aided school because the members usually share a faith or an
ethos of some sort and there may not be a diversity of approach about
how the school is run. We cannot say that that will necessarily be the
case with the new foundation schools. What currently works for a few
thousand faith schools may not work for thousands of schools that
change their status under this legislation.
<p><a name="06101925000124"></a>The Minister went on to
say that he expects that in many trust schools a minority of the
governors will be appointed by the trust. That may well be so, but we
cannot rely on that. We need to set a minimum representation of freely
elected parents below which a foundation cannot go if we are to be sure
that the board of governors will not be stuffed with the trust&#146;s
placemen and placewomen. What we are asking for is not extreme; it is
quite modest and is that the current

Minister's problem with that.</p><p><a name="06101925000125"></a>I
turn now to Amendments Nos. 39 and 40. When my noble friend Lady Sharp
introduced these amendments in Committee about our concept of schools
working together in a community trust she received a fairly encouraging
response from the Minister. He
said:</p><ul><a name="06101925000769"></a>&#147;If she means
trusts that have local authority engagement within the provisions of
the Bill as it stands, they absolutely can. We will give strong
encouragement to local authorities to be engaged in trusts alongside
other local community groups and organisations which can make a
substantial contribution to improving
schools&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/7/06; col.
1133.]</ul><a name="06101925000706"></a>However, later he
said:<ul><a name="06101925000770"></a>&#147;The 20 per cent
level for local authority engagement in trusts, as set out in the Bill,
gives local authorities the flexibility to play a valuable role in
brokering those relationships and supporting the formation of trusts in
their communities. The 20 per cent figure is also consistent
with provisions in local government legislation about local authority
involvement in companies and trusts more widely.</ul><ul><a name="06101925000771"></a>However, we do not believe that it is
right to increase that proportion beyond 20 per cent, which will get
close to making local authorities the dominant force in a trust. If a
local authority wishes to have that level of control over a trust, it
anyway has the option of promoting a community school and exercising
this control directly&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
18/7/06; col. 1134.]</ul><p><a name="06101925000126"></a>That reply very effectively revealed the
Government's attitude to local authorities.</p><p><a name="06101925000127"></a>Perhaps I may take in
order the points made by the Minister. First, he talked about 20 per
cent being the normal level of involvement of local authorities in
companies and trusts more widely. We are not taking about an ordinary
company, such as might be set up to enhance local job opportunities or
economic development, but of a school into whose hands we put the
future of our children. These need to be accountable to the whole
community. They do that through the local authority and through the
ballot box.</p><p><a name="06101925000128"></a>Secondly, the
Minister does not want a local authority to be the dominant force in a
trust. Why not? It represents the local people&#151;current and
future parents of the school. Have not many local authorities
demonstrated their very high level of expertise in running successful
schools over the years? Are we to throw away all this expertise? I can
understand that poor performing local authorities are not desirable
partners, but to leave the provision only to the top performing ones is
going too far.</p><p><a name="06101925000129"></a>Thirdly, the
Minister talks about the opportunities for local authorities to promote
community schools. He knows that the Government have stacked the odds
against the ability of local authorities to open new community schools.
They have to jump through all sorts of hoops that others do not have to
negotiate, such as achieving top rating on an inspection. Indeed, the
ability of the best local authorities to open new schools at all was
introduced into the Bill in another place in response to Labour rebels
and their serious concerns about trust schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000130"></a>The Government have
once again demonstrated their control-freakery. They do not trust the
ballot box and they do not trust local authorities, even their own, to
run schools any more. They may have some justification 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_879"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 879</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regarding some of the worst authorities, but in tackling that problem
they are throwing out the baby with the bath water. They are removing
the influence of vast numbers of perfectly competent authorities, which
in turn are answerable to the electorate at the ballot box for what
they do in schools and elsewhere. We are trying to address that matter,
as well as the very serious issue well laid out by my noble friend in
Committee, and which I will not repeat, that we wish to see more
co-operation rather than competition between schools. That is what our
concept of community foundation would achieve, and I recommend our
amendments to the House. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06101925000131"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew72"></a><a name="06101925001733"></a>Lord

My Lords, I support the first of these three amendments. I
rightly applaud the Government's emphasis on the role of parents in
education and in the shape of schools. Amendment No. 21 would give
legislative endorsement to that general statement, which I think
Members of the House have thoroughly supported. If this provision were
not accepted, I would want to know in what circumstances it would be a
hindrance to good
governance.</p><h5><a name="06101925000930"></a>Noon</h5><p><a name="06101925000132"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew73"></a><a name="06101925001734"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I, too, support the
first amendment. Perhaps I should declare my interest as the president
of the National Governors&#146; Association. It and other
organisations have serious concerns that the parent governor quota, as
it were, would be, if not obliterated completely, certainly diminished
in its importance. However keen I am on parents' councils, they do not
have anything like the power, authority or responsibility of
governors.</p><p><a name="06101925000133"></a>I
understand the Minister&#146;s concern to have competent governors,
especially when turning a school around, changing to trust status, and
so on but, at the very least, I want maximum assurance from the
Government that they will look locally for the skills required to carry
out those functions. My preference would be for there still to be that
degree of local representation and demonstration of what the community
needs to make for a more cohesive
environment.</p><p><a name="06101925000134"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew74"></a><a name="06101925001735"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, I appreciate the points raised
by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland,
about the importance of parents being engaged in schools, including in
their governance. I will address that point directly, because the Bill
does not diminish the engagement of parents in the governance of
schools. The specific issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, is whether the proportion of parents required to be on the
school governing body should be elected as opposed to being appointed,
which they may be in a trust school or a voluntary-aided school as part
of the representation of the trust behind the
school.</p><p><a name="06101925000135"></a>The reason why we have
maintained and will continue to maintain their position is that where
the trust itself appoints a majority of the governors, it is
permissible to diminish the number of elected parent governors because
otherwise it is impossible for the trust to appoint a majority. The
capacity for a trust to appoint a majority is necessary for the trust
to be able 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_880"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 880</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to maintain the level of leadership and control over the school that is
essential for raising standards. After all, that is precisely the model
that applies in voluntary-aided schools at the
moment.</p><p><a name="06101925000136"></a>The
noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, largely answered herself. She said that
she thought that 4,288 schools was too small a base from which to draw
conclusions about successful governance. In all my experience of public
policy, there are very few areas in which we have a model that is
successfully operating in one in five among the totality of cases. I
stress the words &#147;successfully operating&#148;.
Voluntary-aided schools include a high proportion of the most
successful schools in the country. They are not simply Church schools;
a number of other trusts are represented among those schools. The noble
Baroness argues against a model that works very satisfactorily in 4,288
cases across the country and in which parents feel manifestly engaged
in governance&#151;those schools are substantially more
oversubscribed than community schools, on average, which is the acid
test of whether parents in the locality think that those schools are
successful. It is simply not credible for the noble Baroness to argue
on the basis of that successful experience that there is somehow either
a danger or a diminishment of local community engagement, including
parent engagement, in making the same governance arrangements available
to a wider number of
schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000137"></a>Let me stress that
under the Bill, no school will be forced to acquire a trust or to allow
the trust to appoint a majority of governors. It will be for the
governing body of that school to decide whether it thinks that the
benefits that will come from an external partner are worth the
transition to trust status. It is the governing body as presently
constituted that will make that decision. So no external force is being
applied in the matter.</p><p><a name="06101925000138"></a>Within
acceptable bounds&#151;we believe that the bounds in the Bill are
acceptable&#151;we want to extend to schools the freedom to shape
their own governance in the way in which voluntary schools and academy
schools currently can. Specialist schools, voluntary schools and
academies draw enormous benefit from their governance
partners&#151;including, I should stress, governors appointed by
those relevant sponsors from the community that the school
serves&#151;in developing their individual character and ethos. Trust
status will allow these opportunities to be available to any school
that wants to benefit from them, whether they want to do so
individually or collaboratively with other
schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000139"></a>On Amendments Nos. 39
and 40, we believe that the 20 per cent limit on local authority
membership and voting rights in a trust is appropriate. This proportion
is consistent with provisions in local government legislation about
local authority involvement in companies and trusts. The provisions of
the Bill already allow for parents and the local community to form a
trust and to involve the local authority in that trust, subject to the
20 per cent limit set out in the Bill. The amendments would mean that a
local authority may not be involved in a foundation with partners other
than parents and community 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_881"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 881</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>organisations. This could act perversely as a disincentive to trusts
involving the local authority as trust members at
all.</p><p><a name="06101925000140"></a>In
addition, imposing a requirement that the membership of any local
authority that is a member of a trust must be precisely 33 per cent, as
envisaged in the amendments, would provide the local authority with
considerably less flexibility to carry out its role as it sees fit than
do the provisions in the Bill. The amendments also prescribe that,
where the local authority is involved in a trust, all schools that are
part of that trust would be required to federate. We strongly encourage
federation and collaboration&#151;indeed, the trust model is intended
to add to the options for such partnership-working. As the noble
Baroness knows, many successful models of federation are now developing
in the state system. We do not believe, however, that these
relationships are at their most effective when they are forced on
schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000141"></a>Just
as the community school is not the only category of school at the heart
of the community, collaboration and community engagement will not be
the exclusive preserve of a trust with this type of membership. We
already know of schools that are planning to use trust status to
facilitate collaboration. Last month, we published a list of trust
pathfinders that showed a very large group of schools seeking
collaborative arrangements. Indeed, almost all the proposals set out in
the trust pathfinders are for collaborative arrangements between
schools. Only a very small number of the trust pathfinders that we have
published are for single schools seeking to develop individual trusts.
We want to retain the flexibility for trusts to engage in partnerships
of that kind, and it is precisely that kind of flexible arrangement
that is made possible under the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06101925000142"></a>The prescriptive
amendments tabled by the noble Baroness would limit the opportunity for
real collaboration and partnership to grow, and would exclude any local
authority from playing a part in the sort of exciting partnership that
I have just
described.</p><p><a name="06101925000143"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew75"></a><a name="06101925001736"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
reply. I shall say very little about Amendments Nos. 39 and 40, and
will concentrate on Amendment No. 21. We tabled Amendments Nos. 39 and
40 again to emphasise our strong commitment to all schools in an area
that are working together for the benefit of all the children. We would
include all the schools in the area because what happens in any one
school always has an impact on other schools in the area, and we do not
want there to be any chink that allows any school to become a sink
school because of the good things that are happening in another school
nearby. They should all be working together. Our vision is
co-operation, not competition between
schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000144"></a>On Amendment No. 21, I
thank the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe, for their support. The Minister said many things
with which I agree, but I disagreed with his statement that we should
rely on what works well in one in five of our schools. What about the
other four in five? They are all being governed very successfully in
most cases. Failing schools are very much in the
minority.</p>

that, where a school is moving to foundation status, it is under
pressure from members of the forthcoming foundation and may be

the governing bodies of schools, we would like to test the opinion of

majority of the parents of the registered pupils of the
school&#148;<p><a name="06101925000152"></a>The
noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos.
23, 24 and 38, concerning the process by which a governing body can
propose a switch to foundation trust status from being a community or
voluntary-controlled school.</p><p><a name="06101925000153"></a>The amendments would give parents in
particular but also other stakeholders in a school more say in the
process. Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 24 relate to Clause 22, on the
right of the governing body to determine its own foundation proposals.
As the clause stands, the governing body could decide by a simple
majority. We are very unhappy with that
proposal.</p><p><a name="06101925000154"></a>Amendment No. 22 seeks
that any proposal on a change of status from a community school to a
foundation school should be approved by a ballot of the parents of the
registered pupils at the school. These amendments were debated at
considerable length in Committee. In response to this amendment, moved
by my noble friend Lady Williams, the Minister replied&#151;I find
this slightly odd&#151;that it would be
&#147;disproportionate&#148; to require ballots for a change of
trust status. He was encouraged in thinking that a ballot was
unnecessary by the noble Lord, Lord Gould, who is not in his place
today, and who expressed very interesting
sentiments:</p><ul><a name="06101925000773"></a>&#147;Compulsory
ballots are a cumbersome, time-consuming and rather intimidating
procedure that is intended to slow down the pace of reform and to make
genuine parental participation less likely rather than
more&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/7/06; col.
1138.]</ul><p><a name="06101925000155"></a>Earlier in his speech,
the noble Lord had said that in polls he had conducted, 72 per cent of
parents had shown that they wanted more involvement in schools, but he
made it quite clear that ballots were not the way to do it. He
said:</p><ul><a name="06101925000774"></a>&#147;That is not to
say that ballots should not be held if the governing body wishes to
hold them; but it is to say that one-off compulsory ballots do not help
the cause of greater parental empowerment, and are likely to slow it
down. One-off compulsory ballots are not genuine participation; they
are a device to get in the way of genuine participation, and they
should be resisted&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/7/06;
col. 1138.]</ul><a name="06101925000707"></a>It seems to me
that those are not the words of a democrat, and I am very surprised to
hear the noble Lord, Lord Gould, express such
sentiments.<p><a name="06101925000156"></a>Is
it really disproportionate to ask, as we are doing, for a ballot?
Amendment No. 23 asks for a two-thirds majority of the governing body
rather than a simple majority. Amendment No. 24 asks for consultation 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_885"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 885</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with feeder primary schools about the move. Transition from community
status to trust status is a substantial move. It is sufficiently
substantial for the Government to feel that it is very important,
because they are encouraging many schools to go down that route. It
requires a substantial change in the governance of the schools, with
far greater powers for the trustees appointed by the
foundation.</p><p><a name="06101925000157"></a>We heard in the
previous debate that the only governor to be elected to a foundation
will be the single parent governor. No other governors are elected. One
is a representative from the local education authority but apart from
that, all the governors are appointed by the foundation. From having
three or four elected parent governors and other representatives of
communities on the board to a school being run by the foundation is a
substantial change. Parents need to be consulted and to have their
views taken into account.</p><p><a name="06101925000158"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Gould, said that we needed to know the precise
electorate involved in the ballot. The amendment specifies that it
would be the parents of registered pupils at the schools. We are saying
quite precisely who shall be involved. It could be said that that is
not a totally satisfactory electorate because it involves the future
parents of pupils at a school, but as a proxy for who to go to, those
most likely to be immediately affected by the change are the pupils at
that school. It is therefore appropriate that their parents should be
involved.</p><p><a name="06101925000159"></a>The Minister also
claimed that we on these Benches are motivated by an antipathy towards
trust schools. Yes&#151;while we do not feel total antipathy towards
trust schools, we certainly feel scepticism. It is all about
structures; above all, we are unhappy about the contempt shown for
democratic processes. I feel that the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord
Gould, are very offensive to the democratic processes within community
schools. He argues that parents need more empowerment. Parents need to
have a say. We referred to corporate law and to the fact that local
authorities, when they take part in something corporate, have 20 per
cent representation. When one company takes over another, it is put to
the vote of all the shareholders. On this occasion, the Government are
allowing the directors of the board to take the decision without
putting it to the shareholders, who, we feel very strongly, should have
a say.</p><h5><a name="06101925000933"></a>12.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06101925000160"></a>We have tabled four
amendments that relate to this matter. Amendment No. 22 asks
specifically that the parents of registered pupils at the school should
have a chance to participate in a ballot about the proposed change in
the structure of the governance of the school. In Amendment No. 23, we
are asking that the decision should be taken by a two-thirds majority
of the governing board, not just by a simple majority. Again, that
seems reasonable. The decision is on a very considerable change in the
governance of the school, which would require the full support of the
governing board, not just a very slim majority.</p>

for consultation&#151;and consultation alone&#151;with feeder
primary schools. Amendment No. 38 asks only that there be a meeting and
consultation with representatives of the parents of the school. With
the exception of Amendment No. 23, these are extremely mild
and perfectly reasonable amendments, and I hope that the Government
will look sympathetically on them. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101925000162"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew79"></a><a name="06101925001740"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, in case the noble Baroness is
in any doubt, let me declare myself at the outset to be a very proud
democrat who has been to the fore in many of the arguments that we have
had over the past few years on the case for substantial reforms towards
greater democracy in society&#151;including, I should stress, within
schools. We have had very fruitful debates about the role of school
councils and democracy inside schools, on which, I am glad to say, we
have been at one with the Liberal Democrats. So we go quite a long part
of the way together.</p><p><a name="06101925000163"></a>We part
company on the specific issue of whether, in order to become a trust
school, the school must itself hold a ballot of parents. There I am
also glad to rely on the democratic mandate of the House of Commons. An
amendment on ballot requirements similar to those in this amendment was
defeated in the House of Commons by the extraordinarily large majority
of 291, by 412 votes to 121 votes. Let me put it this way: the elected
House held a ballot and voted against this proposal by a margin of over
three to one in a very large Division. That should carry some weight
with your Lordships about the role of democracy in the transition of
schools to trust
status.</p><p><a name="06101925000164"></a>The
Bill sets out substantial requirements for consultation on changes of
school status and organisation. A school wishing to change category or
to acquire a trust needs to consult a range of local partners on these
proposals. Regulations, which we have made available to noble Lords,
list those who must be consulted. They
specify,</p><ul><a name="06101925000901"></a>&#147;parents in
the area who may be affected by the proposals, including parents of
pupils at feeder primary schools and those living in, or who have
children attending a school in the area of, an adjoining local
education
authority&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000165"></a>The
governing body may then publish proposals, but must take account of any
responses to the consultation and must operate within certain
conditions set out by the regulations. These arrangements are
consistent with established consultation procedures for other changes
of status which fundamentally affect the character of a school,
including changes to admissions arrangements and the addition or
subtraction of sixth forms and special needs provision. Mandatory
ballots are not required for such
changes.</p><p><a name="06101925000166"></a>I should stress to the
noble Baroness that many of those changes are much more profound than
the move to a trust, which may appoint a minority of the
governors&#151;in some cases, only one or two, because of the nature
of the trust relationship with the school in question. To have the
rigid template that the noble Baroness envisages would not be
sensible.</p><p><a name="06101925000167"></a>However,
at its discretion a governing body has the right to hold a ballot, and
it may well be appropriate for it to do so if the issue of moving to
trust status was 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_887"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 887</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>particularly controversial within the school community, for example. The
governing body of a school may also choose to hold a public meeting of
parents&#151;it has absolute power to do so. But we do not believe it
necessary to impose mandatory requirements in respect of either ballots
or public meetings.</p><p><a name="06101925000168"></a>As for the
electorate, I thought that the noble Baroness was remarkably frank when
she said&#151;and I wrote it down when she said it&#151;that the
electorate that she proposes in her amendment was not a totally
satisfactory one. So the House needs to be clear that the noble
Baroness is asking us to vote on a proposal which she herself describes
as not totally satisfactory.</p><p><a name="06101925000169"></a>I
agree with her that it is not totally satisfactory. In many cases when
schools want to become trust schools, it will be because the school is
profoundly failing and needs a very substantial boost and change of
character if it is to become an attractive school in its community. As
a Minister, I spend a lot of time visiting schools in that
circumstance, and the greatest body of local parents who need to be
engaged in the life of that school are not those of children who go to
the school&#151;because these schools often have very sharply
declining rolls and small student populations&#151;but the local body
of parents who will not enrol their children in it until it is
transformed and provides a satisfactory level of education for them.
There are so many cases where that has happened that I do not believe
the noble Baroness was in any way incorrect in describing her proposal
as not totally satisfactory. I would, if I may, go slightly further and
describe it as totally unsatisfactory, because it does not capture the
range of partners who need to be engaged in the wider consultation
within the community about whether a change of status of a school would
help to boost opportunities and standards for the pupils who either
attend that school or might attend it if it
improved.</p><p><a name="06101925000170"></a>On Amendment No. 24,
the list of persons who must be consulted according to regulations
already includes other schools in the area,</p><ul><a name="06101925000775"></a>&#147;likely to be affected by the
proposal&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000708"></a>This level
of detail is more appropriate for regulations and, as the regulations
already ensure that feeder primary schools must be consulted, I hope
that the noble Baroness will be
reassured.<p><a name="06101925000171"></a>Finally, on
Amendment No. 23, we do not think it right that governing bodies should
be required to act by a two-thirds majority. A governing body's
decision would normally be by simple majority of those governors
present, including in all the other decisions that I mentioned a moment
ago. Therefore requiring a two-thirds majority when deciding on trust
acquisition proposals would set a threshold which does not apply to any
other decision by a governing body, including equally fundamental
decisions such as engaging or withdrawing from special needs provision,
and opening or closing sixth forms. We see no good justification for
it.</p><p><a name="06101925000172"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew80"></a><a name="06101925001741"></a>Baroness

this is not the democratic way to go is quite
unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06101925000173"></a>The Minister quoted
again, as he did in Committee, this business of the mandate from the
House of Commons&#151;that the vote was 412 to 121. Yes, it was, but

in the House of Commons, so he did not actually have the full backing
of his own party.</p><p><a name="06101925000174"></a>We are not

noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I wish to speak
also to government Amendments Nos. 27 to 30. Government Amendments Nos.
26 to 30 relate to the removal of foundations. Clauses 25 to 27 provide
for the governing bodies of certain foundation schools with
foundations&#151;trust schools&#151;to publish proposals to remove
the school&#146;s foundation. Otherwise it would be possible to
terminate the relationship between a school and its foundation only by
closing the
school.</p><p><a name="06101925000188"></a>Amendments
Nos. 26 and 27 correct deficiencies in the existing wording of the
Bill. They clarify the circumstances in which a minority of the
governors of a school may trigger the publication of proposals to
remove the school&#146;s foundation. Amendments Nos. 28, 29 and 30
deal with arrangements for agreeing the transfer of land where a
foundation is removed, and any associated compensation. This may be
compensation in relation to capital expenditure incurred on school land
or in relation to the value of the land itself. The effect of these
amendments is to ensure that governing bodies have a full picture of
the implications of removing a foundation when they are considering
their proposals. They will eliminate the risk that a governing body may
publish proposals that cannot subsequently be
implemented.</p><p><a name="06101925000189"></a>Amendment No. 31 is
intended to deal with those exceptional cases where a trust school is
established on land provided by a foundation from private sources, and
the foundation is removed. Such cases will be extremely rare. We are
concerned here only with schools established after the Bill is enacted
on land provided from private sources, either as trust 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_891"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 891</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schools or as voluntary schools which subsequently change category to
become trust
schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000190"></a>Where
a foundation is removed, we would expect land held by the foundation to
transfer to the school&#146;s governing body. In these circumstances,
compensation may be payable to the trustees of the foundation. If the
objects of the foundation extend beyond the purposes of the school from
which the foundation is removed, the trustees may use any money that
they hold for those other purposes. If they do not, and the trustees do
not wish to use any money that they hold for the purposes of the
school, they may apply to the Charity Commission to make a cy-pres
scheme to vary the foundation&#146;s charitable objects.</p><p><a name="06101925000191"></a>Amendment No. 31 in this group, in the
name of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth, would
oblige the Charity Commission, when considering such an application, to
treat the school from which the foundation had been removed as if it
had been discontinued. It would prevent any money held by the trustees
being used for the purposes of that school. The amendment also seeks to
amend Section 554 of the 1996 Act, which gives the Secretary of State
the power to make orders about the use of Church of England
endowments.</p><p><a name="06101925000192"></a>We entirely
recognise the right reverend Prelate&#146;s desire to ensure that
endowments provided for the purpose of Church of England education
should continue to be used for that purpose. But having given a good
deal of consideration to the matter, the department cannot accept his
amendment for the following
reasons.</p><p><a name="06101925000193"></a>First, it will be open
to the trustees of any foundation to apply to the Charity Commission
through the normal route where they wish to vary the
foundation&#146;s objects. The Charity Commission would consider each
application on its individual merits, taking account of the purposes
for which the foundation was originally set up and the change in
circumstances which led to the application. We do not believe that it
is right to seek to fetter the Charity Commission&#146;s discretion
in considering such
applications.</p><p><a name="06101925000194"></a>Secondly, there
may be circumstances in which money held by a foundation might
legitimately be used for the purposes of the school which removed the
foundation. This might be the case where, for example, the land
previously held by the foundation was originally provided for the
purposes of education in a particular locality, or a school with a
particular religious character. I should stress that a school may not
lose its religious character simply by removing its foundation. So a
Church of England school which removed its foundation would continue to
be a Church of England school in the eyes of the law, and would still
be subject to diocesan oversight by virtue of the Diocesan Boards of
Education Measure 1991.</p><p><a name="06101925000195"></a>I should
also explain that it would be open to the trustees of a foundation to
take steps to protect the foundation&#146;s position before the
foundation became subject to removal. Where the governing body of
voluntary school established after the Bill came into force wished to
change category to foundation, which would make the school&#146;s
foundation subject to 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_892"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 892</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>removal, the governing body could publish proposals for such a change
only with the trustees&#146; consent. The trustees could either
withhold their consent, or seek to vary the foundation&#146;s objects
so that if it were subsequently removed, any money held by the
foundation could be used for other purposes. Similarly, where it was
proposed to establish a new trust school on the site of a former
voluntary school, the trustees could also seek to vary the objects of
the foundation before the school was
established.</p><p><a name="06101925000196"></a>Government
Amendments Nos. 45, 46 and 48 make explicit that the schools
adjudicator has the powers to determine the public share of disposal
proceeds where a school proposes to sell non-playing field land and the
matter is referred to the
adjudicator.</p><p><a name="06101925000197"></a>Clause 36
introduces Schedule 4, which amends Schedule 22 to the School Standards
and Framework Act 1998, which protects public investment in non-playing
field school land. The provisions of this Bill include that where a
maintained school wishes to dispose of publicly funded non-playing
field land it must inform its local authority, which can claim a share
of the proceeds which are attributable to public investment. Where
there is not local agreement, the matter can be referred to the schools
adjudicator for
determination.</p><p><a name="06101925000198"></a>However, we have
not yet directly in the Bill given the adjudicator the power to
determine what share of the disposal proceeds is attributable to public
investment, and although it is implicit in the other powers he is
given, we consider it safer to give him an explicit power in the Bill,
which these amendments
do.</p><p><a name="06101925000199"></a>Amendments Nos. 47, 49 and
50 correct errors of drafting, by inserting a missing word, and by
correcting two cross-references.</p><p><a name="06101925000200"></a>I am glad to tell the
right reverend Prelate that the Government propose to accept Amendments
Nos. 51, 52 and 53. While we think that it is unlikely that any future
Secretary of State would act to thwart the reasonable wishes of the
trustees of a discontinued school to dispose of trustee land where it
can no longer serve an educational purpose, we are aware that the major
voluntary bodies are not so sanguine. To give them confidence that this
Government do not aim to blight trustees&#146; use of their own
property, we are content to accept these amendments. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101925000201"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew84"></a><a name="06101925001745"></a>The

noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 32 and 33 go hand in
hand. Amendment No. 32 calls for a total review of special educational
needs provision, a full inquiry into the reasons why special schools
have closed, a consideration of the views of parents of children with
special educational needs and a thorough examination of all the
categories of special educational needs. The amendment would also
ensure that a review was completed within six months of the Bill being
enacted. Amendment No. 33 places a moratorium on the closure of special
needs schools until the review as designed in Amendment No. 32 has been
carried out.</p><p><a name="06101925000216"></a>The
Minister&#146;s words in Committee made for interesting re-reading.
He stated:</p><ul><a name="06101925000790"></a>&#147;In fact, the
proportion of pupils with statements in special schools has risen over
the past five
years&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000709"></a>He went on to
say that that rise in
proportion,<ul><a name="06101925000902"></a>&#147;demonstrates
that there is no national policy of seeking to close special
schools&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/7/06; col.
332.]</ul><a name="06101925000710"></a>Yet, there is a
missing link in that statement. I am afraid that the rise in statements
for pupils with special educational needs does not in itself amount to
national policy. As far as I am aware, the statementing process is not
controlled from the Department for Education and Skills, so I do not
see the link. If the Minister meant to commit to a national policy that
will champion the continued existence of special schools and halt their
closure until a full review has been undertaken, I would welcome that
commitment wholeheartedly. <p><a name="06101925000217"></a>I
make it absolutely clear that I recognise and applaud the achievements
of all schools that provide an education for children with special
needs in both mainstream and special schools. In providing for children
with special needs they perform an increasingly demanding task, yet the
system suffers from inbuilt flaws. First, there is the existing bias in
legislation, which has led local authorities across the country to
believe that they are required to opt for mainstream. Secondly, there
is the statementing system, where it becomes increasingly clear that
the funds do not follow the child. The Minister has admitted in his
evidence to the Select
Committee:</p><ul><a name="06101925000791"></a>&#147;As minister
for special educational needs ... I would be the last person to
claim that all is well in the system. Almost every day I deal with
correspondence from members of the House about difficult individual
cases, including complaints about both the quality of provision and the
action of local authorities in assessing the needs of individual
children&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000218"></a>Three
major reports on SEN have been published in the past six months. There
are 1,300,000 pupils in this country without statements who have
special educational needs, according to the DfES statistics. They rely
on our complicated system of statementing and inconsistent provision of
special needs education. The SEN debate is gathering significant
momentum. There is a real sense that some functions of the system are
unacceptable, and real confusion among parents about how best to
navigate that system. The representations to the Education and Skills
Select Committee report were widely drawn and varied. The 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_895"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 895</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>conclusions drawn by the University of Cambridge report, <I>The Costs of
Inclusion</I>, were just as varied and searching. Yet I found myself
disappointed by the Government&#146;s response to both those
reports.</p><p><a name="06101925000219"></a>While both the Select
Committee and the University of Cambridge reports advised for the
adoption of a national framework with local flexibility, the Government
have declined even to investigate the option and declined to gather the
empirical evidence that would provide a clear sense of the
effectiveness of the statementing system and the effectiveness of SEN
provision in the mainstream. As the Minister stated in Committee, the
number of children with statements increases year on year. SEN is a
part of our education system that is here to stay. Yet the
Government&#146;s policy pledge of 2004, <I>Removing Barriers to
Achievement</I>, tells us
that,</p><ul><a name="06101925000903"></a>&#147;the proportion
of children in special schools should fall over
time&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000711"></a>Indeed, the
Minister sought to reassure us on these Benches in Committee that the
population of children in special schools is broadly static over recent
years. But a glance at the figures tells us that since the 2004 policy
paper,<I> Removing Barriers to Achievement</I>, that population has
dropped by 2,400, the lowest it has been since 1997.
<p><a name="06101925000220"></a>What is more, government guidance of 2001
<I>Inclusive Schooling</I>,
states:</p><ul><a name="06101925000792"></a>&#147;The starting
point is always that children who have statements will receive
mainstream education&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000712"></a>If that does not constitute an
assumption in favour of inclusion, I do not know what does. Yet the
Minister has insisted on many occasions that Her Majesty&#146;s
Government do not have such a policy. Action speaks louder than
words. <p><a name="06101925000221"></a>The heart of the
matter is that many pupils rely on special school education. There are
also many who are served well in the mainstream. A bias against special
schools is not only unfounded but unfair to those children who could
benefit so much from the wholesale provision that those schools can
offer. It is hard to ignore the evidence to the Select Committee which,
in the report summary, stated that,</p><ul><a name="06101925000904"></a>&#147;an indiscriminate approach in
implementing a policy of inclusion ... fails those vulnerable
children who need support the
most&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000713"></a>It is hard to
ignore the evidence of schools in the <I>The Costs of Inclusion</I>
report, where a year 1 teacher describes the anti-incentive of the
statementing process
where,<ul><a name="06101925000905"></a>&#147;we
can&#146;t really hit the high spots, achievement-wise for that child
because then if we did that they wouldn&#146;t get the financial
support&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000222"></a>Special
schools are valuable and they are in demand. Amendment No. 33 would
protect existing special schools until a fair and balanced SEN strategy
has been prepared for the future. There is strong evidence to show that
children with statements want to be taught in special schools. In 2003,
more than 5,000 children with statements transferred from mainstream
schools to special schools, and only 1,200 went in the other direction.
The Disability Rights Commission stated last year that,</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_896"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 896</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="06101925000906"></a>&#147;many parents of disabled
children have little confidence that mainstream schools will provide a
safe environment where their children can reach their full
potential&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000223"></a>Let me
make it perfectly clear that I do not propose today to increase the
number of special schools, nor do I propose to decrease the number of
children with SEN in mainstream schools. What I do want to make clear
is that the evidence shows us that special schools are successful and
should be regarded as centres of excellence that pave the way in
achieving in some of the most challenging areas of education. Yet 120
maintained SEN schools have closed since this Government came to power
in 1997. Since the introduction of the Government&#146;s paper in
2004, <I>Removing Barriers to Achievement</I>, no fewer than 45 special
schools have been closed. The number is far less in the private sector;
clearly the demand for special school places remains. It seems that the
private sector is, in so far as it can, redressing the balance of
children who wish to be educated in special schools. I was shocked to
discover that in the past four years the number of children with
statements who are educated in special schools has dropped by 3,230,
while 450 more children with statements are being taught in pupil
referral units than in 2002.</p><p><a name="06101925000224"></a>It
is clear that the Government&#146;s policy on paper, however well
meaning, does not reflect the reality. I fear that the
Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee&#146;s
substantial report is little more than complacent. The committee
proposed a national framework, to which the Government
answered:</p><ul><a name="06101925000793"></a>&#147;The
Government accepts such a framework is desirable ... it believes it is
being built through the Every Child Matters Change
programme&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000714"></a>But that
programme is based around lists of outcomes not processes. On paper,
the scheme is laudable, but as evidence from our Select Committee
stated:<ul><a name="06101925000794"></a>&#147;While we feel
strongly that local authorities should ensure that every child with
... SEN ... must have access to a diverse range of mainstream
and specialist provision ... we do not believe that this is best
achieved by a law that specifies outcomes. Rather, we believe it can be
best achieved by a law that empowers parents to determine that
outcome&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000225"></a>I could go on.
We need a review of SEN provision, of statementing and of the planned
relationships between special and mainstream schools, local authorities
and, most importantly, parents. That is what these two important
amendments are all about. Remember also that we are asking only for a
moratorium for six months following the passing of this Bill. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101925000226"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew89"></a><a name="06101925001750"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I do not propose to say a
great deal about this, because I intend to say a lot more about the
range of special needs provision when we come to the group that begins
with Amendment No. 81; and I do not want to weary the House by saying
it all twice. Your Lordships will have to be patient.</p><p><a name="06101925000227"></a>Although I have a great
deal of sympathy with what the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, has said,
we are not minded to support the amendment for a number of reasons. Of
course, children with special needs are some of the most vulnerable
children in our system, 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_897"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 897</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and of course their needs must be appropriately met. That word
&#147;appropriately&#148; is very pertinent. There is more than one
way of meeting those needs appropriately and in the best interests of
the child; and that phrase must be at the heart of our
discussions.</p><p><a name="06101925000228"></a>There may be some
considerable benefit in having a review of the statementing process and
the way in which resources are directed towards the child. The Minister
will have heard us talk many times about how that can be
achieved&#151;with pupil premiums and by directing additional
assistance to those children who really need it in the schools that
they attend. Those may be mainstream schools and there are many
examples of where properly resourced mainstream schools can provide
education in the best interests of children with special
needs.</p><p><a name="06101925000229"></a>It is the emphasis of the
noble Baroness&#146;s review that we do not support, particularly
where she asks that
it,</p><ul><a name="06101925000907"></a>&#147;seek the views of
parents of children with special educational
needs&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000715"></a>We do not
think that one should not do that. Of course one should, but it is not
possible to close a special school without obtaining those
views&#151;and I do not know any local authority that would not.
There would be an outcry if it tried to get away with not taking on
board the views of those parents. Closing a special school is of
enormous interest to the parents of the children attending the school
and those children who may attend it in future. They will certainly
make their views heard. I do not know of a local authority that would
not be forced to hear those views, even if it was unwilling, which most
are not.<p><a name="06101925000230"></a>If the Minister can
reassure us that he will have a careful look at the way the
statementing process works&#151;it is too bureaucratic and stressful
for children&#151;and at the way resources are directed towards the
children who need them most, we will not support the amendment. If he
cannot give us that assurance, perhaps we may
reconsider.</p><p><a name="06101925000231"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew90"></a><a name="06101925001751"></a>Baroness

the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and if my noble
friend Lady Warnock had been here&#151;sadly, she had to leave as she
had another appointment&#151;she would have even more passionately
supported both amendments in the group, particularly Amendment No.
32.</p><p><a name="06101925000232"></a>From what I have seen on
recent visits to special schools, there is a clear demand for them
beyond that which is provided for. The result has been that children
who are seen to need such places have had to be bussed long distances
and so on. I would be in favour of the mainstream sector coping with as
many pupils with special needs as possible and of the choice both of
the parents and of the child being firmly taken into
account&#151;remember that these days we are very keen on hearing the
views of the child in all these
matters.</p><p><a name="06101925000233"></a>However, major closures
have taken place and the enthusiasm for new forms of dealing with
problems tends to get a bit out of control, the momentum goes on and
on, and suddenly you perhaps realise that

about it. The two amendments would provide just what is needed in that
respect and provide time for a hard look at what is
happening.</p><p><a name="06101925000234"></a>In reference to the
Question asked earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Morris, the gathering
together of the human rights of people with disabilities applies at
least as much to the whole subject of education as it does to the
specific area that he referred to. Please&#151;I hope that this issue
will be taken seriously. I would like the Government to accept the
amendments, because we need to take an urgent look at the whole
situation. The Secretary of State would still be allowed to make
exceptions, although I am a bit nervous about the inclusion of that
provision.</p><h5><a name="06101925000937"></a>1.15

Condon:</b> My Lords, I support in principle the
amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and declare an
interest as grandfather of a grandson with special educational needs
who is currently going through a statementing process. I am in the
privileged position to have the time, resources and networking to try
to understand that complex process, but I worry about those families
who do not have such time or resources to try to find a route through
this often confusing maze of statementing in trying to find the best
for their children. I have found it difficult to help to find a route
map for my grandson in considering schools and special schools. It
remains a confusing area, even for those who are best placed to find a
way through it. I encourage the Minister to consider these amendments
and, at least, to think about a review of statementing, the provision
of special schools and so
on.</p><p><a name="06101925000236"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew92"></a><a name="06101925001753"></a>Lord
Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> My Lords, I, too,
support these amendments on the grounds that they are timely. There is
no doubt that there have been benefits for many children from the
switch of direction and the focus on moving into mainstream schools,
but the momentum of the changes is now significant and it is timely to
review the system. I have visited a number of schools and have seen
that some perverse incentives are now being built into the system, so
that schools perhaps start to do what is their interests rather than
what is in the interest of the
individual.</p><p><a name="06101925000237"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew93"></a><a name="06101925001754"></a>Lord
Northbourne:</b> My Lords, I have been a governor of
a special EBD school and I have done much work with children with
emotional and behavioural difficulties. When the noble Baroness, Lady
Blackstone, as Secretary of State, put through the Education Bill that
gave rise to the big reduction in special schools, I fought it, because
I believed that the Government were doing that to save money. I
honestly think that it is difficult to treat this problem objectively,
because there is a lot of money involved.</p><p><a name="06101925000238"></a>I think that I shall support the
Opposition&#146;s amendment, because there is a need for an
independent look at this problem free from political bias. The
opposition Benches are bold in bringing forward their proposal; they
may be hoist by their own petard if they were to take over the
government 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_899"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 899</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the country. The sort of processes that such an inquiry might
introduce could lead to substantial increases in the amount of money
that needs to be spent on special needs children&#151;because it is
needed.
</p><p><a name="06101925000239"></a>That is a
different issue from the statementing process, which was a disaster
when I was involved with it. Local authorities were delaying it because
they knew that once children were statemented they would have to spend
the money on looking after those
children.</p><p><a name="06101925000240"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew94"></a><a name="06101925001755"></a>Lord
Campbell of Alloway:</b> My Lords, I support the
principle of the amendment in the light of my experience of such cases
at the Bar and the fact that I managed to put, by amendment, special
educational needs provisions into the Act, with the aid of Lady Blatch.
The amendment would enable something to happen in practice about a
practical defect that needs to be addressed. I apologise to the House
for speaking without having been present
earlier.</p><p><a name="06101925000241"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew95"></a><a name="06101925001756"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, the amendments focus on the
role of special schools. As the Minister responsible for special
schools and special educational needs, I should say at the outset that
there is no category of schools in our educational system that performs
a more valuable or important role than special schools. Special schools
often offer the only opportunity that pupils with moderate or severe
learning difficulties will ever have for a decent start in life. They
have exceptionally good specialist resources that they are able to make
available. The Government have no policy whatever of favouring the
closure of special schools. Our policy is that the interests of local
children must come first, and local authorities, which have a duty to
make decisions in this regard, must, as they are required to do under
the Education Act 1996, take full account of the needs of pupils in
their area in arranging the pattern of provision between
schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000242"></a>Perhaps
I may back that up, because in my experience there is no better
testament to whether the Government take something seriously than
whether they are prepared to put money behind it. It is wrong to say
that we are not putting resources into either special educational needs
at large, on which there has been an almost 50 per cent
increase in resources over the past five years, or special schools in
particular. Perhaps I may give the House the statistics for special
schools. Spending on special schools that are maintained by local
authorities has increased since 2000 from &#163;890 million
to &#163;1.3 billion. That is a huge increase to enable the
quality of provision in those schools to improve. In addition to that
&#163;1.3 billion, we also spend &#163;506 million on fees for
pupils at independent special schools. That figure is up from
&#163;287 million in 2000. So there has been considerable public
investment in sustaining and improving the quality of special schools
in recent years, and we stand by them.</p><p><a name="06101925000243"></a>Another material factor
is that the proportion of pupils with statements who attend special
schools has risen over the past three years, and the raw figures on the
closure of special schools, of which the noble Baroness has made much,
are very misleading. At the local level, we are seeing a good deal of
reconfiguration of special educational needs provision in order to 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_900"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 900</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>improve it. That often includes the amalgamation of special schools that
are on totally unsatisfactory sites because there has not been the
required level of investment over recent years, or the establishment of
units attached to mainstream schools, of which a significant number
have opened in recent years. In addition to the
80,000 pupils who attend special schools, 20,000 are located in units
that have the same quality of special needs provision but are attached
to mainstream schools. That has been a big area of development in
recent years.</p><p><a name="06101925000244"></a>There is also resourced
provision, by which I mean specialist provision in respect of
particular special educational needs provided in mainstream schools.
Resourced provision in mainstream schools has increased significantly
in both quality and quantity in recent years. Perhaps I may quote
Ofsted's judgment in its report, which was published only in July, on
the different forms of special educational needs provision. Its
conclusions are very pertinent to the discussion that we are having
today. It said that there
was,</p><ul><a name="06101925000908"></a>&#147;little
difference in the quality of provision and outcomes for pupils across
primary and secondary mainstream schools and special schools. However,
mainstream schools with additionally resourced
provision&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06101925000716"></a>that
is, mainstream schools with funding specifically to develop specialist
special needs
provision&#151;<ul><a name="06101925000909"></a>&#147;were
particularly successful in achieving high outcomes for pupils
academically, socially and
personally&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000717"></a>We are
supporting the capacity of local authorities, taking account of the
interests of their localities, to develop their provision, whether in
units, in special schools, which may be reconfigured or brought
together, or within mainstream schools. We do not believe that a
moratorium on the closure of special schools at present or an inquiry
of the kind envisaged by the noble Baroness, which would have the
effect of throwing in flux our whole policy on special educational
needs, would be desirable.<p><a name="06101925000245"></a>I
shall finish dealing with Amendment No. 32 by turning to the question
of an inquiry. When I became a Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Baker, a
former Secretary of State, gave me very good advice. He said that my
starting action when considering any issue relating to education policy
should be to read the relevant Ofsted report. I have taken that advice
to heart, and I always follow it when considering any issue. We have
just gone through an exhaustive inquiry with the House of Commons
Select Committee on special educational needs, and, as the noble
Baroness said, we responded to it in full last week. Ofsted's strong
advice to us was not to conduct a fundamental review at present, only
two years after the publication of our major policy statement,
<I>Removing Barriers to Achievement,</I> which includes an important
continuing role for special schools. I shall quote Ofsted's advice to
the Select
Committee:</p><ul><a name="06101925000795"></a>&#147;If we had a
big review at this time, the danger is that it would diversify work,
resources and developments in such a way that it could send us back to
the point of the slow progress that we were having prior to
2004&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000718"></a>That was the
judgment of Ofsted. Brian Lamb, the highly respected chair of the
Special Educational Consortium, said the same to us. After we had
published our response to the Select Committee, he 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_901"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 901</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>said that the SEC was very pleased that the DfES had renewed its
commitment to its 10-year strategy in <I>Removing Barriers to
Achievement</I>. He
said:<ul><a name="06101925000796"></a>&#147;We don&#146;t
need a radical review. We want to make the system work better. There
are lots of things here that will help with
that&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000246"></a>Finally,
if I may, I shall quote the judgment of Treehouse, which, as noble
Lords will know, is the national charity for autism education and whose
president is, I believe, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. It runs
the outstanding school in north London for children on the autistic
spectrum. When we published our response to the Select Committee, it
issued a press release saying that it agreed with the conclusion of the
Government, Ofsted and the Special Educational Consortium that the
existing evidence does not support a wholesale review of the SEN system
or structural reorganisation of local authority
commissioning.</p><p><a name="06101925000247"></a>So I believe that we
have a substantial body of inspectorate and respected professional
opinion behind us in developing our policies in the way that we are,
including substantial additional investments. However, I am constantly
mindful of the need to keep the existing system under review and to
seek to improve it.</p><p><a name="06101925000248"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley, asked me particularly about the statementing process. We
considered very carefully whether there was a case for the wholesale
replacement of the process, but we decided that that would not be
appropriate at present as no proposals have come forward, and none has
come forward in our intensive internal consideration, that offer a
better prospect than the statementing process at large as a way of
allocating resources for those with high levels of special educational
needs.</p><p><a name="06101925000249"></a>However, our advisers
are working constantly with local authorities to promote best practice
in statementing. We want to see much more joint working between local
authorities, for example, in the commissioning of provision and in the
way in which they manage the statementing process to ensure that
outcomes are improved. As the noble Baroness will know, we recently
commissioned an audit of low-incidence special educational
needs&#151;an area of particular pressure within the special needs
community. Our report on that has led to a substantial body of work in
joint commissioning between local authorities and to approaches that
will improve outcomes of pupils who are statemented and the operation
of the statementing process.</p><p><a name="06101925000250"></a>We are very mindful of
the need constantly to improve the statementing process and to
accelerate the speed with which local authorities deal with statements.
There has now been a significant improvement in that but, in response
to the Select Committee, we set out a number of new performance
indicators that we wish to agree with the Local Government Association
to accelerate the issuing of statements and the proper consideration of
professional reports, which are essential to the production of
statements. So we are constantly seeking to improve the system and we
will look at all reasonable proposals to do so.</p><p><a name="06101925000251"></a>However, we do not
believe that a fundamental review at present, contrary to the advice of
Ofsted and the other professional bodies that I have cited, would be in
the best interests of children with special educational 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_902"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 902</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>needs. Elected local authorities take their responsibilities very
seriously in this area, and we think that removing their discretion to
improve the arrangements for special educational needs by changing the
pattern of local provision, in the way envisaged by Amendment
No. 33, would work against, and not in favour of, the interests of
children with special educational
needs.</p><p><a name="06101925000252"></a><b><a name="61019-0002.htm_spnew96"></a><a name="06101925001757"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
reply. I also thank all noble Lords who have supported these
amendments, including a former chief inspector of schools. I feel
strongly about these amendments. Perhaps I can quote from the Select
Committee report, in which one of the Minister&#146;s DfES officials
said:</p><ul><a name="06101925000797"></a>&#147;Certainly Lord
Adonis is looking for a review of certain aspects of special
educational needs and ministers collectively want to look at a
&#145;third
way&#146;&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000719"></a>The
committee said that there must be access to a wide range of mainstream
and specialist provision and
that,<ul><a name="06101925000910"></a>&#147;we do not
believe that this is best achieved by a law that specifies
outcomes&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000720"></a>The
Government&#146;s response was that the best way of improving
outcomes for children with SEN and disabilities is through sustained
action to build the capacity of the system. We need a thorough review
in order to build that
system.<p><a name="06101925000253"></a>I
have not at any stage suggested that the Government are not taking this
seriously and are not committing resources and, therefore, public
investment to the SEN system, But the system has serious faults.
Parents feel that they are ignored when local special schools are
closed. We need a thorough review. I feel that a thorough review of the
system is essential to achieve our aim. All I am asking for is a brief
period in which to take stock and to consider carefully how we develop
a sustainable system to meet the growing need for SEN provision. Surely
the whole system of statementing goes to the heart of that. I hope that
noble Lords agree. I wish to test the opinion of the
House.</p><h5><a name="06101925000938"></a>1.30

Government what assessment they have made of the current situation in
Zimbabwe.</p><p><a name="06101925000261"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, we have not debated Zimbabwe for a
considerable time. I am grateful to have the opportunity to put that
right today.</p><p><a name="06101925000262"></a>The Government of
Zimbabwe get more brutally violent day by day. The courageous opponents
of Mugabe&#146;s regime have been demonstrating their opposition more
vigorously than ever. Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the main part of the
MDC, has been touring the country and steadily getting more support.
The campaign against Mugabe is backed by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions, the South African trade union organisation COSATU,
Zimbabwe&#146;s National Constitutional Assembly, the Zimbabwe
National Students Union, a statement by the ILO, Women of Zimbabwe
Arise&#151;a brave and active group&#151;and the Churches, apart
from the Bishop of Harare who has been busy collecting farms. 



<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_905"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 905</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is also backed by the combined Harare residents association, local
organisations and a group of black trade unionists in the United
States.</p><p><a name="06101925000263"></a>That is a great
increase in active and vocal support. In this country, the TUC is
planning a meeting in London on 4 November, at which the president of
the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions will be present. He has recently
been imprisoned and savagely beaten, suffering broken bones.</p><p><a name="06101925000264"></a>The struggle is now more violent and has
turned more to governance than the economy. On the economy, however,
incredibly, it gets steadily worse. Zimbabwe, which used to be one of
the most developed countries in Africa, has now been designated a
&#147;least developed country&#148; by the World Bank. Life
expectancy has fallen to 34 years for women and 37 for men&#151;the
lowest in the world. There has been a drop of 50 per cent in GDP. Farms
are being seized by the army, even from black farmers, because soldiers
are not being paid. The brain drain of highly qualified people
continues.</p><p><a name="06101925000265"></a>What can be done on
governance? I have some proposals. First, sanctions are absolutely
vital and must continue. If they were to be reduced, the morale of
those opposing Mugabe would collapse, as would their campaign. I am
told that some members of the European Union are a bit wobbly on
sanctions, especially those from southern Europe, although the
Scandinavians are sound. Her Majesty&#146;s Government should give
this top priority.</p><p><a name="06101925000266"></a>Secondly,
many of Zimbabwe&#146;s neighbours are suffering economically, such
as South Africa, as well as many others in SADC. South Africa fears
that Zimbabwe will implode, flooding it with even more immigrants. I
suggest that South Africa could use its dominant position in SADC to
call for Zimbabwe to be suspended from its membership so long as Mugabe
is in power.</p><p><a name="06101925000267"></a>Efforts should be
made in the UN Security Council to follow up the excellent report, by
the UN official responsible for habitat, on Mugabe&#146;s scandalous
operation, Murambatsvina, which destroyed the housing of between
700,000 and 1 million people. Despite Mugabe&#146;s promises, only a
tiny minority of these people have been rehoused. The whole operation
was designed principally for electoral purposes.</p><p><a name="06101925000268"></a>The new UN
Secretary-General could be urged to visit Zimbabwe in place of Kofi
Annan, whose visit, planned for this year, was aborted by Mugabe.
Mugabe alleged that it would clash with the nomination of the
ex-president of Tanzania, Mr Mkapa, who had been called in to
mediate&#151;so Mugabe said&#151;between Zimbabwe and the United
Kingdom. This ridiculous proposal was correctly rejected briskly by Her
Majesty&#146;s Government.</p><p><a name="06101925000269"></a>Another proposal is perhaps more
ambitious and controversial. In April 2006, the Security Council
decided in a resolution that it should have the
power,</p><ul><a name="06101925000911"></a>&#147;to use
appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means ...
to help protect populations from ... crimes against
humanity&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_906"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 906</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06101925000721"></a>This means, of course, possible
intervention, with the approval of the Security Council, in the
internal affairs of other countries. It follows a report by the
Secretary-General in 2005 on the reform of the United Nations, and the
broad proposals of which it is part are referred to as the
&#147;responsibility to protect&#148;. The words I have used are
distinct from any dealing with military action&#151;I am not talking
about that; it is not relevant to what I am saying. Her
Majesty&#146;s Government could take a lead with like-minded
countries, to work out how to apply this part of the Security Council
resolution usefully in the present situation in Zimbabwe. There is no
doubting the massive crimes against humanity there.
<p><a name="06101925000270"></a>Noble Lords may think
that Mugabe would respond to such a move with his usual accusations of
imperialism. Would they be so effective now that we would be on the
side of the black trades unions in Zimbabwe and the United States? We
have, of course, no imperial ambitions, as he would allege, and as much
right as any other country to rely on the duty to protect, as given in
this new proposal, in relation to Mugabe&#146;s actions.</p><p><a name="06101925000271"></a>We are
Zimbabwe&#146;s biggest provider of aid. There are more Zimbabwean
exiles in this country than in any other country, and we have more
knowledge of Zimbabwe than any other country does. The president of the
Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions will be at the TUC meeting on 4
November, and he has already said that the United Kingdom should take
the lead in these matters. His advice is worth listening to, so if
Mugabe accuses us of neo-colonial ideas, as he has for the past six
years, we should not now be concerned.</p><p><a name="06101925000272"></a>Events in Zimbabwe are now moving a
little. In Cairo, on his way back from the General Assembly of the UN,
Mugabe said the,</p><ul><a name="06101925000912"></a>&#147;police were right in dealing
sternly with the ZCTU
leaders&#148;</ul><a name="06101925000722"></a>and,<ul><a name="06101925000913"></a>&#147;some
people are now crying foul that they were assaulted. Yes, you get a
beating ... when the police say move,
move&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000723"></a>Those words
were in a report by the valiant campaigner for freedom in Zimbabwe,
Kate Hoey MP, who has recently been in that country as she reported in
the <I>New Statesman</I> on 9 October. Mugabe&#146;s words will be
relevant if matters ever come to The Hague, as they amount to Mugabe
claiming responsibility for the actions of the police.
<p><a name="06101925000273"></a>More open support by
Her Majesty&#146;s Government for the campaign for democracy in
Zimbabwe would give a boost to that campaign, which is being vigorously
conducted. I hope they will give that support.</p><h5><a name="06101925000940"></a>1.52

Lord, Lord Blaker, on his remarkable persistence in again bringing
before your Lordships&#146; House the tragedy that ZANU-PF has made
of Zimbabwe. I look forward to the contributions of all noble Lords,
and I hope that they will join the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, and say
more about South Africa. My old friend, the noble Lord, Lord St John of
Bletso, who 15 years ago welcomed me to this House when I made my
maiden speech in a debate on South Africa, can usually be relied on to
stress his other homeland.</p>

D'Souza:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord,
Lord Blaker, for providing this opportunity to address once again the
awfulness that is going on in Zimbabwe today. The recent arrest,
prolonged detention and severe torture of many members of the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions is but the latest example of the savage
actions of the police. The arrests in mid-September took place before
the explicitly announced peaceful demonstrations against the Zimbabwean
Government&#146;s mismanagement of the economy, which has reduced the
country and its citizens to a state of penury and starvation. Those
still in detention are at risk of death due to lack of medical
attention to the injuries they sustained during torture. This series of
arrests and its aftermath are extraordinary, even by the standards set
by the Mugabe Government in the past couple of
years.</p><p><a name="06101925000278"></a>Now is,
perhaps, the time to use the full array of legal, diplomatic and other
measures open to the UK and the EU in order to create a critical mass
of international opinion and to support those in Zimbabwe who bear the
unspeakable brunt of repression. The UK Government, who have had to
withstand charges of wishing to re-colonise Zimbabwe, have nevertheless
made strong statements against President Mugabe&#146;s regime and
have supported strong actions, but more can now be done. In particular,
the EU, which passed a resolution condemning human rights abuses in
Zimbabwe in September, is due to revisit both official and personal
travel sanction in January 2007. The noble Lord, Lord Blaker, has
already mentioned that there may be some EU countries, notably
Portugal, which wish to ease these sanctions. I ask the UK Government
to oppose with vigour any such moves to strengthen wherever possible
the criteria for their removal, and to vote to keep, and even extend,
such sanctions.</p><p><a name="06101925000279"></a>The newly
established Human Rights Council, which will convene its third session
at the end of November, provides yet another forum in which to initiate
and table a further resolution on Zimbabwe. Any resolution should
endorse and thereby reaffirm that passed by the council of the Africa
Union&#146;s African Commission on Human and Peoples&#146; Rights,
if only to try to mitigate the accusation of western interference. At
the UN level, there is the opportunity to lobby at the General
Assembly, including in the Third Committee on governance and human
rights. The Zimbabwean situation has now reached such proportions that
it is appropriate to refer Zimbabwe to the Security Council.</p>



<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_908"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 908</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101925000280"></a>I remind the Minister of the
recommendation in the report of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs
2005:</p><ul><a name="06101925000798"></a>&#147;We recommend that the United
Kingdom start a campaign for the referral of Robert Mugabe to the
International Criminal Court for his manifold and monstrous crimes
against the people of
Zimbabwe&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000724"></a>Torture
in Zimbabwe is widespread, systematic and severe and therefore
constitutes a crime against humanity. Under the Rome statute of the
International Criminal Court, there is a duty on all those who are
signed up to the statute to bring a prosecution at the court in The
Hague. Perhaps now is the time to initiate a campaign on
that.<p><a name="06101925000281"></a>Finally,
given the blatant and severe torture committed by the Zimbabwe police,
and its approval at the highest level, can the Government encourage the
UN to exclude the Zimbabwe police from participating in any
international peacekeeping missions, such as UNMIK in Kosovo, where a
new group has just been
sent?</p><h5><a name="06101925000942"></a>1.57

Park of Monmouth:</b> My Lords, we owe a great debt
to the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, for securing this debate. Mugabe, the
great liberation leader, thinks in terms of command operations. Last
year, Operation Murambatsvina destroyed the urban population and the
urban opposition. Since many of the urban poor had returned, this year
Operation Round-Up again removed children and the homeless to the
countryside. I am glad to say that those operations were successfully
publicised to the world by, among others, the admirable Kate Hoey, and
were roundly condemned by the UN rapporteur, Anna Tibaijuka, and after
her by Jan Egeland. However, UN agencies inside the country as usual
felt unable to act to help the victims unless asked to do so by the
Government. Tents were flown in, and tents were rejected and flown out
again. The new housing in Operation Garikai, which was allegedly meant
for the homeless, was allocated to soldiers, policemen and
ZANU-PF.</p><p><a name="06101925000283"></a>However,
far worse was to come. It was the creation of command agriculture in
Operation Taguta, which means, &#147;eat well&#148;. I am indebted
to the admirable Solidarity Peace Trust report for the information that
follows on this. The military already managed food distribution through
the Grain Marketing Board, and now they are also responsible for food
production. This has the political advantage that angry, underpaid and
demoralised soldiers will be kept active and well fed, whatever happens
to the rest. The tragedy is that they know nothing about farming. In
irrigation schemes, they have wantonly destroyed cash crops, including
some for export, have ordered all established fruit trees to be
uprooted, and market gardens, an essential source of income for lack of
which most children can no longer be sent to school, have also been
destroyed. Plot-holders have been turned into paupers. The military are
destroying established crop rotation structures and, in one case, the
fertility of the fields through the grossly ignorant over-use of
fertilizers. Underpaid, discontented troops have seized whole maize
harvests, 



<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_909"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 909</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>leaving families with nothing. Needless to say, there is wide corruption
and 60 per cent of the funds allocated to agriculture have never
reached the farmers, and the same is true of the diesel allocation.
Vice-President Mujuru told the farmers that no family should receive
more than 10 maize cobs a day from their own fields. Plot-holders must
apply to the soldiers to get one maize cob for each family
member.</p><p><a name="06101925000284"></a>As if it were not bad
enough to be beaten and starved and to see their children lose all hope
of school, the farmers see the arbitrary reallocation of plots by the
soldiers. This has caused deep anxiety over tenure and the power of the
community to make its own decisions. In Matabeleland the brutality of
the soldiers and their absolute power has brought back memories of the
murderous destruction wrought by the Fifth Brigade in the 1980s. Once
more the people are entirely at the mercy of the troops; they are
starving; and the government are successfully destroying their
independence.</p><p><a name="06101925000285"></a>The harvest was
never going to be enough, despite all these recipes for failure, but
since Mugabe told the World Food Programme earlier this year that there
would be no need for further food aid, WFP food is running out, there
are no donors, and a famine is certain. Food distribution will be cut
by 60 per cent immediately, and 364,000 school children and 190,000 of
the chronically ill are expected to die. We are looking not at the
death of a nation but at its murder by its own rulers; and from Anna
Tibaijuka and others, we know that the UN, though present and anxious
to help, has been rebuffed as has the whole western
world.</p><p><a name="06101925000286"></a>However, brave Kate
Hoey's most recent incursion has confirmed that there are still many
Zimbabweans&#151;trade unionists, the women's movement, the human
rights cohort, the Churches and the judiciary&#151;incidentally the
brave lawyer Beatrice Mtetra has just been given the Woman of the Year
award&#151;who continue bravely to resist and to protest. What they
lack is the oxygen of publicity in a world where they cannot speak on
the radio or through the press or gather together, and they cannot move
around or communicate countrywide for lack of funds. I believe that we
have a duty, through trade union links, Bar Councils, women's movements
and so forth in the free world, to enable civil society to survive and
lead the country. They need funds, support, and to know they have
friends.</p><p><a name="06101925000287"></a>As the UN, the large
NGOs and government seem paralysed, and the African Union leaders value
one cruel and reptilian liberation leader above the suffering of
millions, civil society in the free world must act. Very little money
would be needed to give a voice to the students, the trade unionists
and the other unknown and unsung leaders whom we must help to help
themselves. It is vital they should be in place and have an effective
national voice when the situation implodes. They, not the UN or the AU,
must decide what happens then. The first thing they will want is the
return of the rule of law. No squalid bargains must be struck by the
world with this loathsome regime to pre-empt the wishes of the

into no negotiation about the future of the country over their
heads.</p><h5><a name="06101925000943"></a>2.02

Earl of Sandwich:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord
Blaker, does us all a service in raising this issue again. Earlier this
year Zimbabwe ranked fifth in <I>Foreign Policy</I> magazine's index of
failed states, alongside Iraq and worse than Afghanistan and even
Somalia. With inflation still over 1,000 per cent&#151;the highest in
the world outside a war zone&#151;and acute shortages of everything,
a once prosperous country, and the most promising multiracial African
state only 25 years ago, has been brought to its knees. The breadbasket
has become the basket case.</p><p><a name="06101925000289"></a>This
is largely the achievement of one man who has transformed himself from
an acclaimed idol of the liberation struggle to a ruthless dictator who
is well past his sell-by date. In passing over the known atrocities
which this regime has perpetrated&#151;the Matabele massacres; the
attacks on farmers and farm workers, black and white; the torture and
abuse of elected politicians and trade union leaders; and the wanton
destruction of homes&#151;we must pay tribute to the ordinary
Zimbabweans who have resisted these torments and who ultimately will
survive their tormentors.</p><p><a name="06101925000290"></a>There
is no point now in recalling the expectations we had when I was working
for the British Council of Churches at a time, a generation ago, when
we were rejoicing at Zimbabwe's new saviour. Since then the Churches
have been divided, compromised and silent. But there has been some
reawakening in the last year through the Zimbabwe Christian Alliance
and its related Save Zimbabwe Campaign. This campaign has brought
together a wide spectrum of civil society, professional men and women
merely seeking peaceful change. But such groups have to contend every
day with repressive legislation such as the Public Order and Security
Act which forbids public gatherings. As the noble Lord, Lord Blaker,
said only last month, Wellington Chibebe and a dozen other trade
unionists were imprisoned, tortured, and, in his case, beaten

the UK not to mouth anyone's propaganda but to get our facts right and
listen to Zimbabweans. I know of someone who spent half of last year
assisting hundreds of people made homeless by the notorious Operation
Murambatsvina. He says that, disguised as an urban clean-up exercise,
this operation,</p><ul><a name="06101925000914"></a>&#147;reduced thousands of people to
refugees in their own homeland and destroyed livelihoods for many
households&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000725"></a>Many of
his relatives who are professionals, he says, have been
&#147;literarily reduced to paupers&#148; by rampant inflation and
economic meltdown. There is no exaggeration here. Zimbabweans like
these are still fleeing the country in their thousands, just as others
once came from Zambia and Botswana to Zimbabwe to find work and a means
of survival. With farm evictions continuing, who knows what is
happening to thousands of farm workers and landless labourers, many of
whom have been forced by the army to

eyes of the restricted media can only be imagined.
<p><a name="06101925000292"></a>Equally, we must not
forget the extent of the past suffering of African leaders, including
Mr Mugabe and his family, who were imprisoned or tortured during the
struggle against colonialism and apartheid. That does not excuse it,
but it has inevitably coloured the bitter feelings that they have
carried with them into so-called liberation. Friendships made then
endure, and we have to recognise that. We must remember that even the
present leaders of the &#147;front-line states&#148; are likely to
show solidarity well beyond the call of duty. The actions of such as
Benjamin Mkapa or Thabo Mbeki, who act as intermediaries, cannot be
dismissed simply on the grounds of their contact with Mr
Mugabe.</p><p><a name="06101925000293"></a>It is
important for every bridge to be built, and this of course includes our
own aid programme and those who take part in it. I fully acknowledge
what DfID has been doing through the United Nations and civil society,
especially to combat hunger and HIV/AIDS. We cannot expect a lot more
from our own Government in the absence of conventional diplomacy. But
they could give Zimbabwe more priority. We could keep pressing for more
effective EU sanctions. We should also take care that we adopt
immigration policies that are fair to those genuinely seeking asylum,
as distinct from those found to be fraudulent. I believe that the
British public would like Zimbabwe to be a special case. And yet under
the fast-track process we are detaining and sending back more and more
genuine refugees to an unknown fate. The Government must think again
about the effects of this policy on our friends in Zimbabwe and
elsewhere in Africa.</p><h5><a name="06101925000944"></a>2.07

Lordships'
House.</p><p><a name="06101925000295"></a>There
is a popular saying that pessimism is sensible because pessimists are
never disappointed. Unfortunately I have been an optimist for Zimbabwe,
and I have been bitterly disappointed. There have been so many false
dawns for Zimbabwe and her long-suffering peoples in recent years when
it seemed as though a deal would be done and a government of national
unity would be established and law and order restored. The essence of
most of these initiatives, generally originating in South Africa, is
that President Mugabe would agree to step down and a government of
national unity would be formed in return for a guarantee that leading
members of the ruling ZANU-PF party would be granted amnesty from
prosecution.</p><p><a name="06101925000296"></a>There have been
times when agreement seemed imminent but the deals have failed, most
recently because of the indictment of Charles Taylor, the former
President of Liberia, for human rights crimes. The incident scared
Robert Mugabe into believing that the same fate might await him. He
therefore prefers to cling to power. In those circumstances, most
observers accept that Robert Mugabe will remain as President of
Zimbabwe until he dies. Sadly

before it gets better.</p><p><a name="06101925000297"></a>Some observers
continue to believe that the people of Zimbabwe will rise against their
leaders, in much the same way as the people of Romania rose against
Ceausescu, and the Ukrainians staged their Orange Revolution. Sadly, I
believe that such an uprising in Zimbabwe is extremely unlikely. It did
not happen when the Zimbabwean Government launched their cruel
operations to bulldoze the stalls and shacks of street traders in
Harare in areas where their political opponents are strong. It also did
not happen when the opposition MDC recently called for mass
action.</p><p><a name="06101925000298"></a>There
are two reasons why the people will not protest. First, unfortunately,
there is a lack of plausible opposition in the country. The MDC seemed
credible in the past but is now deeply divided between those who
support Morgan Tsvangirai, a man with charisma but doubtful judgment,
and those who support Arthur Mutambara, a man of great intellect but
less popular appeal. Secondly, a remarkable 70 per cent, if not more,
of Zimbabweans live in rural areas where they remain largely unaware of
the government excesses in the urban
areas.</p><p><a name="06101925000299"></a>As a
result, it is probably true that if a general election was held
tomorrow, ZANU-PF would be the clear winners. In fact, the next
presidential election is scheduled for 2008, with the next
parliamentary election to follow in 2010. There are rumours that the
Government intend postponing the presidential election until 2010,
giving Mugabe another two years in power. Perhaps the Minister could
inform us whether Her Majesty's Government are taking steps to ensure
that the presidential election is held in 2008.</p><p><a name="06101925000300"></a>Succession planning is
of course a key issue. Whenever Mugabe goes, he will probably be
succeeded by one of four main candidates. There is the increasingly
prominent and proactive Governor of the Reserve Bank, Gideon Gono, who
has presided over the recent devaluation of the currency and clampdown
on the parallel currency market. Alternatively, there is the current
Vice-President, Joice Mujuru, wife of the powerful retired general,
Solomon Mujuru; or even the former Finance Minister, Simba Makoni. The
other alternative would be Emmerson Mnangagwa, the former Speaker of
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06101925000301"></a>The sub-plot to
that tussle for power is the struggle between the various clans within
the numerically dominant Shona tribe. Mugabe leads the Zezuru clan,
while Mnangagwa and Gono are influential members of the Karanga group.
Makoni comes from another clan, the Manyika. This difficult situation
leaves Her Majesty's Government in a position where they must continue
to provide humanitarian aid, where possible, and apply pressure on the
Harare
regime.</p><p><a name="06101925000302"></a>Despite
the irrational ranting of their president, many&#151;in fact,
most&#151;Zimbabweans view Britain with deep affection and there is
no doubt that, as soon as circumstances allow, this country will be
expected to play a major role in the reconstruction of Zimbabwe. In
preparation, Her Majesty's Government should start to promote a
Marshall aid programme to support the swift recovery of
Zimbabwe.</p><p><a name="06101925000303"></a>Finally, I add that we
cannot take for granted our pre-eminent position in Zimbabwe, as there

are no doubt making promises that will not necessarily be
delivered.</p><p><a name="06101925000304"></a>I wish to end on a
more positive note&#151;and I appreciate that I have overstepped my
mark by one minute. Zimbabwe remains a country blessed with a
relatively strong infrastructure, arable land, precious metals and
minerals and a highly educated and literate workforce. Mercifully, the
landscape is not strewn with landmines, as in the nearby states of
Mozambique and Angola. The fundamentals remain in place and, when the
time comes, Her Majesty&#146;s Government must be ready to lead the
recovery and to incentivise and motivate the international community to
rebuild that wonderful country. That time, please God, will not be too
far away.</p><h5><a name="06101925000945"></a>2.14

Chidgey:</b> My Lords, I, too, add my congratulations
to the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, on bringing this debate to us today and
on the way that he set out the issues involving Zimbabwe, and to the
many other noble Lords who have made telling and important
contributions to the debate. The courage of the opposition movement was
brought out. It has been pointed out that the economy is slipping back
to least-developed status. The importance of South Africa&#146;s role
in its policy towards Zimbabwe and what might be the British
Government&#146;s influence on that was mentioned by the noble Lord,
Lord Acton. Those are all very important factors that I know the
Minister will address in his
response.</p><p><a name="06101925000306"></a>Zimbabwe is a country
whose economy is now ruined, where unemployment and poverty are rampant
and politically inspired thuggery, crime and repression are endemic. As
noble Lords have mentioned, the annual inflation rate is again more
than 1,000 per cent per annum and is predicted to reach 4,000 per cent
per annum by the end of this year. Unemployment is at 80 per cent, with
hundreds of thousands of skilled Zimbabweans having fled the country,
while the people who remain are surviving mainly on grain handouts. It
is a disastrous
situation.</p><p><a name="06101925000307"></a>Zimbabwe
today is a country facing economic meltdown, with less and less food,
fuel, power, and water&#151;and, under the current regime, less and
less hope. The people of Zimbabwe may not have been able to vote freely
and fairly to give their judgment on the regime through the ballot box,
but nearly 1 million Zimbabweans have voted with their feet, leaving
behind their country and the squalid mess created by the failed
policies of a failed regime that is President Mugabe's
Government.</p><p><a name="06101925000308"></a>For
those in the diaspora who, having fled Zimbabwe, are trying to support
families and relatives left behind, last week&#146;s news from the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe will be particularly bleak. I understand that
the licences of all money transfer agencies were cancelled with
immediate effect. For the past two years, MTAs have provided a vital
channel for expatriate workers to remit literally life-saving funds
back to their families at home. The cancellation of MTA licences
without warning has shocked the banking and financial services sector,

money transfers from overseas facing destitution.</p><p><a name="06101925000309"></a>To add to the misery, last week also saw
the introduction of massive, rolling power cuts across Zimbabwe.
According to the <I>Zimbabwean Herald</I> of 10
October:</p><ul><a name="06101925000799"></a>&#147;Intermittent
breakdowns, a dearth of foreign currency and coal shortages, have in
the past few years, left Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority
grappling with power supply problems and plunged the nation into an
outcry&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000726"></a>Those are the
words of the <I>Herald</I>, not mine.<I></I>The cutting off of the
supply of vital remittance moneys, and the cutting off of the supply of
heat, light and power are just more clear, stark examples of failure in
domestic policy. <p><a name="06101925000310"></a>The country
is sinking down to the level of a failing and bankrupt state, as noble
Lords have mentioned. Where once Zimbabwe stood out among its
neighbours as a model of economic and agricultural success, it now lies
at the bottom of the heap of failing states. Let there be no doubt
about those failures. They are entirely due to the actions of President
Mugabe and his Government and are not due, as he continues to claim, to
perfidious actions of the international
community.</p><p><a name="06101925000311"></a>This may be wishful
thinking, but is it any wonder that, according to a report from the
Zimbabwean Central Intelligence Organisation, dated 9 October and
apparently leaked to on-line media, the people of Zimbabwe are readier
than ever before to join a popular revolt against President Mugabe's
regime? That report comes just a year after security agencies began
issuing similar warnings of civil revolt in Zimbabwe, which might well
have the support of the police and security forces themselves. Of
course, that may be wishful thinking and some sort of double game may
well be going on.</p><p><a name="06101925000312"></a>With the
situation in Zimbabwe becoming ever more volatile, there is clearly a
huge danger of adding fuel to the flames should the UK seek to become
directly involved. Zimbabwe's torment can be resolved safely only
through the democratic process by the peoples of Zimbabwe. On 9
October, in reply to a Written Question, the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State, the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, who is here
today, said:</p><ul><a name="06101925000800"></a>&#147;The
problem of Zimbabwe is between its Government and its people. The
solution is a Government working for, not against, the
people&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/10/06; col. <I>WA
130</I>.]</ul><a name="06101925000727"></a>Those are fine
sentiments to which I subscribe, but, as we all know, achieving the
solution is elusive.<p><a name="06101925000313"></a>I hope
that the Minister will say what in the Government&#146;s view can be
practically done to support civic society in Zimbabwe&#151;where 80
per cent of people are unemployed&#151;by assisting NGOs, charitable
trusts and international trades unions to accumulate the resources they
need to help the proposed new patriotic front to blossom. How can we
support a properly resourced opposition to present a genuine opposition
to ZANU-PF? Finally, how can we support an internationally sponsored
effort to start negotiations in a transitional process and get the
agreement of President Mugabe to leave when his

Astor of Hever:</b> My Lords, since we last debated
Zimbabwe, conditions there have deteriorated dramatically. We have
heard much about that tragic decline in today&#146;s excellent
debate. The time is now right for Her Majesty's Government to adopt a
far more proactive approach. The crisis in Zimbabwe is a threat to the
stability of southern Africa. It is draining the economic energy of the
region and our aid budget. The international community has been happy
for the United Kingdom to take a lead in providing emergency relief for
the victims of the crisis. Perhaps we might also expect to offer a lead
in finding the solution. After all, the causes are hardly a mystery.
They are political and manmade&#151;largely made by one man: Robert
Mugabe. His regime has been shored up by collaborators&#151;some
guilty, some gullible, some in Zimbabwe and some in the international
community.</p><p><a name="06101925000315"></a>It is disappointing
that our diplomatic representatives have to spend so much time
persuading member states not to undermine the EU sanctions and travel
ban targeted at individuals closely associated with the Zimbabwean
regime. Nations hoping to promote their own interests by weakening the
impact of those measures seem to show least support for the people of
Zimbabwe in terms of aid and humanitarian support.</p><p><a name="06101925000316"></a>The people of the UK
have given massive support to the people of Zimbabwe. Together with the
United States we have, over the past six years, provided humanitarian
aid that has fed, at times, more than one-third of the population. It
is therefore particularly sickening that almost every time Mugabe
speaks in public, he denigrates the UK and the US. For far too long
Robert Mugabe has been allowed to set the agenda. The international
community has largely been coerced into silence by Mugabe&#146;s
regional apologists. The response of Her Majesty's Government has been
timid and lacking in conviction.</p><p><a name="06101925000317"></a>In 2001, we had high hopes when the Prime
Minister told us that he had agreed a deal with Africa. In exchange for
more aid and a debt write-off, he told us that Africa promised true
democracy, no more excuses for dictatorship and no abuse of human
rights. Sadly, for Zimbabwe, that is an unfulfilled promise. I do not
single out Zimbabwe simply because it is the focus of our discussions.
In that 2001 speech at the Labour Party conference, the Prime Minister
singled out Mugabe when he said that there should
be,</p><ul><a name="06101925000915"></a>&#147;no tolerance of
bad governance, from the endemic corruption of some states, to the
activities of Mr Mugabe's henchmen in
Zimbabwe&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000318"></a>Recent
events have reminded the world what is really happening in Zimbabwe.
The ILO and the TUC have condemned the Government in Zimbabwe.
Ministers have issued strong statements and stern rebukes. I hope that
a corner has now been turned. I also hope that the Minister will tell
the House that the Government are preparing to give a clear lead in

protect the people of Zimbabwe. Through direct contact with our
partners and regional leaders a process can be started, which will be
welcomed by the people of Zimbabwe. We must help them to deal with the
disease that is destroying their country. When the Prime Minister
announced his deal with Africa he said that progress could be achieved
if we find the will. I am afraid that, to date, as regards Zimbabwe,
his will has been lacking.</p><h5><a name="06101925000947"></a>2.25

(Lord Triesman):</b> My Lords, I congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Blaker, on having introduced this important debate. It
is timely, but, tragically, debates on Zimbabwe are always timely. I
also add my gratitude to all other noble Lords who have spoken, for
their continued engagement and interest in resolving this crisis. I
join the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, in his congratulations to the wide
spectrum of organisations in Zimbabwe on the way in which they have
sustained the struggle in very difficult circumstances. It is right
that we should acknowledge it. I join the noble Baroness, Lady Park, in
commending many of those who have maintained their dynamism in the most
adverse circumstances.</p><p><a name="06101925000320"></a>Let me
deal immediately with some of the points that have been put. I
understand the argument for trying to engage the international
community in the responsibility to protect, which the Government took a
major part in helping to design for the United Nations. It is a sign of
the creative thinking of the House that we have turned to it. This is
no easy matter. The first attempt to get the international community to
engage with a responsibility to protect&#151;in Security Council
Resolution 1706 on Darfur&#151;took a huge amount of work. Even then,
three abstentions were visible in the most appalling of
circumstances&#151;two were fortunately abstentions rather than votes
against by veto-carrying members of the permanent membership of the
Security Council. If we can drive this policy through on Darfur, we
will have taken an extremely large step forward. I do not believe that
there is at the moment the basis for even that degree of support in the
Security Council. I would hate to hand Mugabe another victory of that
kind until we can drive it through
successfully.</p><p><a name="06101925000321"></a>I commend the
realism shown by the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, for the
difficulties inside Zimbabwe in making progress. But I continue to
believe that there is a lot that we can do and that we should do it. Of
course, the general election in 2008 will, I hope, be a clean election,
not a rigged election or an election characterised by the kinds of
unreasonable pressure that have been put on people in other elections,
and that that election goes ahead and is on
time.</p><p><a name="06101925000322"></a>I am delighted that the
noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, is, like me, a student of Labour Party
conferences and the speeches made. I do not truly accept that we are
timid, but I acknowledge how hard it is to find the levers that work,
because they are what we need. We consistently try to find where we can

of the deal on Africa, which has produced a degree of
movement&#151;not enough, but, I repeat, a degree of
movement&#151;among some heads of African states, to which I shall
return.</p><p><a name="06101925000323"></a>I share the concerns
across the Chamber. As the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, said, Zimbabwe is
a failing state. Despite abundant rains, the World Food Programme
reckons that nearly 2 million people will face hunger in the coming
months; I believe that the figure will be larger than that. Poverty
deepens, more and more people are unable to afford the food that is
available and 80 per cent of the population are unemployed, many of
whom are in jobs that earn way below the bread-line. As has been
pointed out, official inflation is at 1,200 per cent and rising: in
reality, it is probably almost twice that figure now. The IMF has
suggested that without reform, as the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, said,
it will reach 4,000 per cent by the beginning of 2007. This is an
economy that has collapsed.</p><p><a name="06101925000324"></a>There are widespread shortages of basic
food commodities and fuel, and constant interruptions in the supply of
electricity and water. Three million people&#151;one-quarter of the
population&#151;have already fled the country. For those who are left
behind, as we have heard in the debate, life expectancy is the lowest
in the world, and it is getting worse: 34 for women and 37 for men.
Yet, despite all that, the Government of Zimbabwe refuse to acknowledge
that they have any
responsibility.</p><p><a name="06101925000325"></a>The
Government ignore international calls for reform and crack down on the
attempts of ordinary Zimbabweans to raise their concerns about the
situation, most recently, as we saw, in the brutal suppression of a
demonstration held by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions on 30
September. So I share the view that it is a failing state, as I share
the view that the world trade union movement, which has a fine history
in this respect, will respond to what has happened with practical help,
as it has historically elsewhere. I join others in congratulating my
honourable friend Kate Hoey on the support she has given recently to
the trade unions and
others.</p><p><a name="06101925000326"></a>However, I have also
noted the way in which Zimbabweans have blamed others for the crisis
they have brought upon themselves. Joseph Made, the agriculture
Minister, who has presided over the collapse, in the past has blamed
falling production in agriculture on helicopter pilots who flew too
high and as a result could not distinguish between maize and lush
grass. He has blamed birds for consuming the harvest. Most recently he
has said that the harvest as a whole failed because of a monkey. He
said that investigations showed that a monkey dived into a
transformer,</p><ul><a name="06101925000916"></a>&#147;and
sabotaged our preparations for the coming
season&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000728"></a>That is the
reason given for the failure of the harvest. The saddest thing of all
is that when this was reported to the Zimbabwean Parliament, it was
accepted without demur. That tells a story in itself. The monkey, of
course, has taken its secrets to the
grave.



<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_918"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 918</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101925000327"></a>Most Zimbabweans understand these problems
very well. They understand the solutions that are required. Like the
noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, I pay tribute to them because they have
always grasped these facts. Many even in ZANU-PF know that the party
must change or it will lose everything. They see the manifest absurdity
of the mistakes that were described so vividly by the noble Baroness,
Lady Park of Monmouth. But Mugabe still opposes reform and Zimbabweans
need to move beyond his leadership or they will decline, and the
decline will accelerate. I also recognise, because it is important,
that there is increasing militarisation throughout the Zimbabwean
economy, with military people taking up command roles in the economy.
In my view that reflects the dependence of this regime&#151;an
increasing dependence&#151;on the military for its
security.</p><p><a name="06101925000328"></a>How should we respond?
Mugabe continues to describe the crisis as a bilateral issue backed, as
he argues, by illegal &#147;economic sanctions&#148;. It is not a
bilateral issue and there are no economic sanctions. The crisis in
Zimbabwe is caused by bad governance and bad policies. The crisis is
between a dictatorial regime and a subjugated people, and it can only
be reversed by significant political reform, including the repeal of
damaging legislation on human and property rights, as noble Lords have
said, together with a comprehensive economic reform package as already
set out by the IMF. The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, asked what we
are doing. I can tell him that one of the things we have been doing is
to take part in the design of some of the programmes which we believe,
if they could be accepted, would make a fundamental
difference&#151;and to provide those to the international community
and the opposition. But I think it is recognised that much of the
reform effort necessarily still has to come from within Zimbabwe.
International pressure should be maintained to encourage the Government
to heed some voices of reason. Many of those voices will come from
within Zimbabwe and we will continue to encourage and assist if we can
human rights defenders and those working for democratic change, in
concert with the EU, the UN and other international partners. Further,
I can assure the House that our embassy in Zimbabwe, often working in
great difficulty, works on this project all the time. We have heard
David Coltart and others from the Zimbabwean opposition expressing
similar views in London
recently.</p><p><a name="06101925000329"></a>I do
not think that Zimbabwe will ever go off the international radar
screen, as I emphasised in my Statement on 14 September after the
crackdown on the union demonstrations. I add that my right honourable
friend Ian McCartney summoned the Zimbabwean ambassador and told him in
the strongest possible terms that it will not go off the radar screen
that these are our concerns, and the EU joined us in making those
criticisms.</p><p><a name="06101925000330"></a>Concern has been
expressed about Africa&#146;s response to the crisis. I have said
before in the House that we press Africa to do more. After all, the
impact of the collapse of Zimbabwe on the region has been huge.
Hunger-fuelled migration is causing problems and regional trade has
been affected. The Zimbabwe

economic crisis in the country cost SADC in the region of $2.5 billion.
If that was carried through to the present day, South Africa&#146;s
economy, had it been able to help to resolve this problem, would be 3
per cent bigger than it is. Above all, Africa&#146;s credibility is
at stake in promoting good governance as set out in NePAD and the
Commission for Africa. African credibility will be damaged unless it is
possible to confront the problems of Zimbabwe.</p><p><a name="06101925000331"></a>Africa is increasingly frustrated. The
noble Lord, Lord Blaker, and my noble friend Lord Acton both raised
questions about South Africa. The South African deputy foreign Minister
has said that his government is concerned not only about the effects on
the people of Zimbabwe but also about the impact on the region as a
whole. Indeed, the hastening economic implosion will see millions of
people trying to cross the Limpopo in search of food and a degree of
security. I should say to my noble friend Lord Acton that we hold talks
with South African representatives all the time, and we have seen some
pressure begin to be put on through the
IMF.</p><p><a name="06101925000332"></a><b><a name="61019-0003.htm_spnew107"></a><a name="06101925001768"></a>Lord
Acton:</b> My Lords, with respect to my noble friend,
I did not ask about talking to South Africa; I asked Her
Majesty&#146;s Government to do everything possible to persuade South
Africa to put maximum pressure on
ZANU-PF.</p><p><a name="06101925000333"></a><b><a name="61019-0003.htm_spnew108"></a><a name="06101925001769"></a>Lord

maximum pressure is by having a continuous dialogue with South Africa
and seeking to persuade
it.</p><p><a name="06101925000334"></a><b><a name="61019-0003.htm_spnew109"></a><a name="06101925001770"></a>Lord
Acton:</b> My Lords, that was not my question. The
question was that Her Majesty&#146;s Government should do everything
possible to persuade South Africa to put maximum pressure on
ZANU-PF.</p><p><a name="06101925000335"></a><b><a name="61019-0003.htm_spnew110"></a><a name="06101925001771"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, I shall not try to repeat the
point I have made. We try to persuade it, and that is done by
talking.</p><p><a name="06101925000336"></a>Tanzania has raised its
concerns about the situation, as have others. In his remarks the noble
Earl, Lord Sandwich, made sure that we inject some realism into what we
think is possible. However, as we have just heard once more, I note
that some noble Lords may believe that not enough pressure has been put
on Africa to deal with Zimbabwe. It is raised at every opportunity and
I will not go through the whole of the list of the occasions on which
it has been raised, but I shall give an example. Zimbabwe was central
to our approach at the African Union summit in Banjul this summer,
where every South African and other leader present found that we were
talking about these issues and urging specifics. So change, while hard
to get, I believe is possible and we must continue to pursue
it.</p><p><a name="06101925000337"></a>Like many in the House I was
also disappointed that Mugabe blocked the visit to Zimbabwe of the UN
Secretary-General. It would have been an important initiative in the
last period of Kofi Annan&#146;s work as Secretary-General. I hope
that the new

the door is as firmly slammed in his face as it was in Kofi
Annan&#146;s.</p><p><a name="06101925000338"></a><b><a name="61019-0003.htm_spnew111"></a><a name="06101925001772"></a>Baroness
Park of Monmouth:</b> My Lords, I hope that the noble
Lord will allow me to ask a question. How do we explain the fact that
the Commission for Africa, in 461 pages, says nothing about Zimbabwe?
Has that situation
changed?</p><p><a name="06101925000339"></a><b><a name="61019-0003.htm_spnew112"></a><a name="06101925001773"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, the United Nations, the
Commission for Africa and everyone else has consistently worked to try
to bring about a change in attitude within the African Union and
elsewhere to Zimbabwe. Efforts have been made in all of those settings
in order to get accurate reports of the disastrous policies and the
particular assaults that have been launched against the people of
Zimbabwe as part of the human rights perspective which has to be
corrected. We will continue to do
that.</p><p><a name="06101925000340"></a>Briefly,
the UK has pressed for and achieved at the UN a firm reference to
Zimbabwe in the EU&#146;s general statement to the United Nations
General Affairs Human Rights Committee. As many noble Lords have noted,
we are engaged in providing humanitarian help. We believe that the UN
must become more engaged politically; the situation in Zimbabwe merits
United Nations Security Council consideration and the collapse makes it
more urgent. We also took the opportunity to raise Zimbabwean issues in
the UNSC in September following the general humanitarian briefing by
Jan Egeland, which was also mentioned in the debate. We will continue
to look for opportunities to ensure that Zimbabwe remains on the
Security Council agenda. However, sanctions must continue. This
involves not just Portugal but quite a number of countries. All sorts
of reasons are produced on the day, but we are determined to fight hard
to keep the sanctions in
place.</p><p><a name="06101925000341"></a>There are prospects and
difficulties in this crisis and there is a range of views among our
partners as to how best to address it. We need to ensure that those
views include tough sanctions. I am clear that for democracy to be
reinvented and reintroduced in the country, it is vital that the trade
unions, the Churches and civil society organisations get the vigorous
help that they need from us. I commend the TUC on its decision to hold
a conference on 4 November; I believe that it will be of great
help.</p><p><a name="06101925000342"></a>The victims of
Mugabe&#146;s self-inflicted crisis in Zimbabwe are
Zimbabweans&#151;the vulnerable, the homeless, the orphans, the
hungry and those suffering from HIV/AIDS. I am proud that our
Government has addressed those questions through DfID and have provided
more than &#163;38 million of humanitarian support in the last
financial year alone to improve food security for 1.5 million of the
poorest people in the
world.</p><p><a name="06101925000343"></a>At UNGA
this year, Mugabe warned the west that every Goliath has its David. He
has continued to use his political weight in the country to oppress and
bully his people into apparent submission, but he should heed his own
words: let this David tell him that his policy is creating millions of
Davids within Zimbabwe and millions more in the Diaspora. He should
reflect on that. The time for his regime has
gone.</p>

noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment seeks a better deal for
young carers. I have met many young carers recently and I am most
impressed by their resilience, dedication and determination. They
deserve our full support.</p><p><a name="06101925000371"></a>Young carers are young
people and children who have a caring responsibility for someone in
their family who has a physical or mental illness, a disability or a
substance misuse problem. They take on caring responsibilities which
are inappropriate to their age, such as personal care for a disabled
adult or emotional care for a parent with a mental health problem. In
addition, they are often responsible for siblings and all the household
chores. Young carers are at risk of educational problems, physical and
mental ill health and family breakdown. About 3 million children in the
UK are affected by disability in their families. Often due to lack of
support for the person being cared for, 175,000 of them become young
carers; 13,000 of those care for more than 50 hours per
week.</p><p><a name="06101925000372"></a>The
current DfES guidance to schools, <I>Advice and guidance to Schools and
Local Authorities on Managing Behaviour and Attendance: groups of
pupils at particular risk</I>, recommends designating a lead member of
school staff for young carers. However, very few schools have
designated such a professional, and the quality of support for young
carers in schools still largely depends on the presence of a voluntary
sector young carers' service and the willingness of head teachers to
engage with the issue. Some schools still believe that we have no young
carers in our schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000373"></a>One young
person said, &#147;I used to run away from school because I always
wanted to be with my mum. I used to think that my mum was going to die.
I was about eight ... they treated me as if I was playing
truant&#148;. No child should have to take on a caring role that
prevents them attending school and enjoying the aspects of childhood
that others take for granted. We also know that parents hate having to
rely on their children for the kinds of intimate support that should be
the role of an adult service. Sadly, thousands of them find little
alternative. The Education and Inspections Bill is a good opportunity
to put the practice recommended by the DfES into law so that young
carers will be supported to attend school wherever they
live.</p><p><a name="06101925000374"></a>At
present, the 300-plus voluntary sector young carers services in the UK
work hard, with little funding, to help schools identify and support
young carers, but the majority of young carers remain unidentified and
unsupported throughout their childhood, while those identified are
often noticed only once they have reached

amendment would ensure that all schools follow the example of the
dozens of excellent schools which have realised the benefit of early
identification and support for young carers, often co-ordinated by a
named member of staff such as a school counsellor or an inclusion
worker. The amendment would also result in more schools making links
with the services which support people who currently rely on the caring
role of a child. Once a family has been put in touch with a more
appropriate sort of care, the cared-for person&#146;s reliance on a
young carer will often be greatly reduced, to the benefit of the
cared-for person&#146;s dignity and the young carer&#146;s
education.</p><p><a name="06101925000375"></a>Good things have
happened since this issue came up in Committee. Representatives from
the All-Party Group on Children, which I chair, and from the voluntary
sector met Jim Knight during the Recess and discussed the following
proposals. First, young carers should respond to the consultation on
the new admissions code, particularly with reference to the
difficulties faced by young carers responsible for getting younger
siblings to a different school or whose parents cannot transport them
to school. Secondly, changes are needed to current school transport
guidance to ensure that provision of this service to disabled parents
is brought in line with the Disability Discrimination Act. Thirdly,
research is needed to establish the link between serial truancy and
young caring. Fourthly, the Minister should visit a school which is
supporting young carers effectively&#151;and there are some. Fifthly,
the DfES guidance should be amended and linked to the Prince&#146;s
Trust guidance for schools. Sixthly, the Minister should write to the
Training and Development Agency for Schools to ask it to think about
putting more emphasis on young carers in the initial teacher training
and continual professional development for teachers. Next, TeacherNet
should link to an electronic version of the Prince&#146;s Trust packs
of lessons and assemblies. Finally, a Minister should visit the Young
Carers Festival, an annual event for 1,500 young carers. Will my noble
friend update the House on what has happened to these
proposals?</p><p><a name="06101925000376"></a>I thank my noble
friend for his personal concern over these issues and look forward to
hearing how the Bill can move things forward. I beg to

schools, with a particular focus on bullying and
attendance.</p><p><a name="06101925000378"></a>As the noble

being bracketed with truants or being seen as poorly motivated. They
are, in fact, often extremely well
motivated.</p><p><a name="06101925000379"></a>I welcomed the
Minister&#146;s assurance that the department&#146;s anti-bullying
guidance <I>Don&#146;t Suffer in Silence</I> is being revised and
that it will pay attention to young carers. The key themes that he said
were likely to be in the revised document include what the noble
Baroness, Lady Massey, put in subsection (2)(a) of her amendment: to
ensure that schools are better able to identify young carers. The
document is likely to address a lot of other good things in relation to
young carers. However, it does not include the request in subsection
(2)(c) of the amendment to ensure that any pupil who is a young carer
is supported by a designated teacher. The noble Baroness also asks that
schools promote the educational welfare of young carers. I am sure that
that part of the amendment would be covered by other parts of the Bill,
but paragraphs (a) and (c) of proposed subsection (2) are very
important. Subsection (3) is also important; when Ofsted inspects
maintained schools, it should look at how well the school is supporting
young carers and give its judgment on that in its
report.</p><p><a name="06101925000380"></a>Young carers make up
only one of many groups of children with some sort of special need, but
it is an enormous group, and a hidden one. It is vital that schools
have the knowledge and the focused support to help young carers, and
are held to account for how well they
do.</p><p><a name="06101925000381"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew121"></a><a name="06101925001782"></a>The
Earl of Listowel:</b> My Lords, I support the
amendment, to which I have added my name, and I support the noble
Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, in encouraging the Government to give
this complex and delicate issue careful consideration. I thank the
Minister for meeting us and for writing to us about the welcome steps
being taken.</p><p><a name="06101925000382"></a>It has been pointed
out that the profile of young people caring for vulnerable adults and
their families does not necessarily fit closely with that of
looked-after children. Nevertheless, there may be a subgroup of
vulnerable children who might be taken into care if they do not receive
the support they need from school. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, gave
figures to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, showing that between
1995 and 2005 there was a 58 per cent increase in the number of
children taken into care and the number of care orders granted. Given
what the Green Paper, which is very welcome, says about early
intervention to prevent families developing a situation in which their
children are taken into care, this might help to reduce the number of
young children being taken into
care.</p><p><a name="06101925000383"></a>I was speaking recently to
Kathy Dunnett, the director of a pilot children&#146;s trust in
Stevenage and the editor of a recent book on the health of looked-after
children. She emphasised that when the school place of a child fails
for whatever reason, the risk of eventually being taken into care is
much greater. I welcome the Minister&#146;s careful response to these
concerns and look forward to his reply.</p>

an opportunity with regard to young carers that may arise in the
forthcoming mental health legislation. The mental health charity for
young people, YoungMinds, would like to introduce a new duty on
authorities. Where there is a family in which one member is subject to
a compulsory order for treatment because of mental health problems,
there should be a duty on social services to assess that family and
look at the needs of all its members&#151;including, of course, the
children. The advantage would be that if the system works correctly,
social services could inform the school so that the child could be
identified early and get the support needed.</p><p><a name="06101925000385"></a>If the Minister thinks it helpful, he
might draw this debate and this question to the attention of his
colleagues in the Department of Health, which might assist these young
people. I look forward to his
response.</p><p><a name="06101925000386"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew122"></a><a name="06101925001783"></a>Baroness
Pitkeathley:</b> My Lords, I, too, was delighted to
add my name to the amendment. It is very important to recognise the
huge progress made with regard to young carers in recent years. It has
been a long time since people said that there was no such thing as a
young carer. But there are still too many gaps in the services, and
there is far too great a gap in the recognition of young carers. School
has always been the area which would be most amenable to
change.</p><p><a name="06101925000387"></a>With regard to the noble
Earl&#146;s comments, we fought very hard to get young carers&#146;
right to assessment included in the first two carers&#146; Acts. It
is already on the statute book. Recognition of young carers, however
far we go with it, is no substitute for proper services provided to the
person with the disability.</p><p><a name="06101925000388"></a>I
have another word of caution. When we talk about recognising young
carers, nobody is suggesting that we want to deny those caring
instincts in young people. We want them to be caring, loving and to
have a duty and responsibility towards their parents; we just do not
want them to be carrying inappropriate burdens, which so many of them
are. In recognising the progress that we have made, can we also
remember that even minor changes in practice in schools or elsewhere
can result in huge changes in support and recognition for young
carers?</p><p><a name="06101925000389"></a>I am delighted to

too. Following on from the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady
Pitkeathley, I should like to put in a word for disabled carers. Some
of them start out disabled but quite a few have back injuries from
helping a disabled parent, for example. It is right that they should
not have to do that. Also, I believe that the incidence of mental
illness among young carers is 33 per cent greater than among other
children.</p>

explanation of what had been done. I congratulate him and his
department on that.</p><p><a name="06101925000393"></a>My first
point, on young carers, has been mentioned already. A lot of them are
fearful that they will be taken into care and that the family will be
broken up. Any way in which it is possible to give them extra support
so that they can combine their schooling needs and the other needs that
children have, as well as seeing that their family remains together, is
much to be welcomed.</p><p><a name="06101925000394"></a>On
bullying, I would like to think that most schools and governing bodies
could take into account in their general discussions about life today
just how lucky most children are who do not have these extra
responsibilities and problems to cope with. By setting such an example,
they might help people to see that bullying is not only inappropriate
but unbelievably unkind in every
respect.</p><p><a name="06101925000395"></a>Finally, can we have an
assurance that governing bodies will consider these issues at least
once a year, as well as identifying the individuals? Will they discuss
what the situation is like generally throughout the country and whether
there can be any mutual help and co-operation even between schools on
the issue?</p><p><a name="06101925000396"></a>I welcome what has
already been done. Whether the new clause can be added to the Bill is
another matter, perhaps, but it is certainly an important
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101925000397"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew126"></a><a name="06101925001787"></a>Lord
Northbourne:</b> My Lords, I lend my support to the
amendment. I agree that young carers are a special case of young people
who need to be admired and supported. The noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, drew attention to the fact that there are many other groups
of children who need support of one kind or another. But what worries
me is that we are laying yet another burden on schools and
teachers&#151;or is that what we are doing? I cannot help wondering
whether there might not be a formula whereby, through pairing or
mentoring, young people themselves could volunteer to be
helpful&#151;or perhaps that role could be taken by the parents of
other pupils or the friends of a pupil who is a carer, if they were
prepared to be welcoming and helpful and contribute towards the caring
role.</p><p><a name="06101925000398"></a>I believe that every child
in every school should have a tutor&#151;an adult to whom they can
turn and whom they know, preferably in the longish term, who is
responsible for and interested in their worries, concerns and behaviour
as well as their work. That is one of the major factors that
distinguishes the best independent schools from most state schools. A
child needs someone to turn to.</p>

Howarth of Breckland:</b> My Lords, I want to build
on the issue of services to the adult rather than the young carer. If
those services were seriously in place, the young carer&#146;s
emotional stability would be much improved. Clearly, they, too, need
support because of the anxiety that they have about the parent. But
looking at the recent report from the Commission for Social Care
Inspection on the availability of home care services, we can see that,
although there are more hours, those hours are going to fewer and fewer
people. From my contacts, I know that if you have back pain, which
means that you are quite seriously inconvenienced if not totally
disabled, the likelihood of your getting help is very narrow indeed,
and your child is therefore going to spend a great deal of time caring
in the home.</p><p><a name="06101925000400"></a>We should face the
realities of those issues, especially now that adult and child services
are separated. I hope that the Minister will encourage
children&#146;s trusts to be firmly in touch with the adult social
care services in their area in co-ordinating the work for these young
people and other vulnerable young people in schools, because I have
some anxieties that these splits will make it even more difficult to
get the right service to the right people at a time when, even if gross
resources are not shrinking, net resources sometimes
are.</p><p><a name="06101925000401"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew128"></a><a name="06101925001789"></a>Baroness

key issues about young
carers.</p><p><a name="06101925000402"></a>Without
meaning to stray from the amendment, I wish to add one thought. The
other evening, the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, introduced an amendment
during the faith debate, which most of us will remember well, in which
she promoted assemblies in schools. I have been thinking about young
carers in relation to assemblies. It is important that their peer group
and fellow pupils should learn to understand what young carers are
going through and what they are coping with, and the best conduit for
that would be through regular assemblies. That would be a way in which
to introduce some of these hugely important issues, which are now much
more out in the open and which we should feel free to discuss. It would
make a huge difference on bullying, too. I worry that the incidence of
bullying and other problems relating to children in school has grown
because of the lack of assemblies&#151;children coming together
regularly and feeling a sense of belonging, cohesion and inclusiveness
within their
school.</p><p><a name="06101925000403"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew129"></a><a name="06101925001790"></a>Lord

with virtually all the points that have been raised in the debate. A
number of points related to action that the Government can and should
take, but several of them related directly to the attitude that schools
should be adopting on young carers. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth,
made a very important point about the operation of children&#146;s
trusts and their responsibility to join up services. This is a classic
example of an issue on which, unless the 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_929"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 929</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>services are joined up&#151;the services and support that the school
can provide for the young carer and the support that adult social
services can and should provide for the individual being cared
for&#151;huge strains will be placed on families and some of the most
vulnerable people in society. Both those being cared for and the carers
themselves come into that category. I very much hope that my department
and the Local Government Association will draw the noble
Baroness&#146;s remarks to the attention of its responsible
officers.</p><p><a name="06101925000404"></a>I was glad to have the
opportunity to meet my noble friend Lady Massey to discuss these issues
more fully, and to meet the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe, too. I wrote to them afterwards and placed a copy
of my full response in the Library of the House so that other noble
Lords can look at it. I accept that we need to do more in this area,
and shall set out some of the work that is train.
</p><p><a name="06101925000405"></a>The recurring
theme in our discussions has been the need to improve awareness of
young carers&#146; circumstances among those who work in schools,
with a particular focus on the issues of bullying and attendance.
Bullying at school can affect any child&#146;s self-esteem,
motivation and achievement, and it is particularly unacceptable that
young carers should face this additional burden. We propose that the
issue of young carers should be highlighted in the forthcoming revision
of my department&#146;s anti-bullying guidance, <I>Don&#146;t
Suffer in Silence</I>. We are currently in the early stages of drafting
the guidance, and our advisory group will review the position at the
end of this month. The group is planning to review a final draft in
mid-December, and final publication is scheduled for February
2007.</p><p><a name="06101925000406"></a>The
relevant key themes likely to be in the revised document that have
particular relevance to young carers are as follows. First, induction
and information procedures should ensure that schools can identify any
young carers, to specify what their specialist anti-bullying needs
might be and to put in place appropriate strategies. Secondly, there
should be greater awareness that young carers may be in the at-risk
group of pupils who are particularly vulnerable to being bullied.
Thirdly, links to voluntary organisations supporting young carers
should be highlighted, with encouragement to use those organisations in
developing school policies. Fourthly, there should be a requirement to
identify incidents involving young carers as such in schools&#146;
records.</p><p><a name="06101925000407"></a>Poor
attendance or lateness is of course a serious issue for many young
carers. It is important that we avoid stigmatising such young carers as
truants or as poorly motivated pupils, when often the reverse is in
fact the case. It is already possible for schools themselves to
authorise young carers&#146; absences where necessary. That is
explicitly covered in my department&#146;s guidance on attendance
management, issued last year. Of course none of us would want to
recommend any approach that would effectively reduce the young
carer&#146;s access to learning, but we entirely accept that teachers
should have discretion in individual cases, and should know that they
have that discretion. There should be a sensible degree of flexibility
in ensuring that young carers can engage in their responsibilities
while still making the very best of school.</p>

working with, and indeed helps to fund, the leading voluntary
organisations with an interest in young carers&#146; issues, notably
the Princess Royal Trust for Carers. We will be incorporating links to
the trust&#146;s material when it is finalised on my
department&#146;s behaviour and attendance website. We have also
asked the trust for its suggestions to strengthen our guidance on young
carers in our web-based document, <I>Managing Behaviour and Attendance:
groups of pupils at particular risk</I>.</p><p><a name="06101925000409"></a>I believe that these
measures, together with other relevant material such as links to the
Disability Discrimination Act, will significantly strengthen our
support for young carers. My department undertakes to ensure that it
uses its well established communication channels with teachers, schools
and local authorities&#151;most notably our TeacherNet
website&#151;to draw attention to the importance of the measures and
to the Government&#146;s expectations for their application to
improve the lives of all pupils who have caring responsibilities. I
also stress that the existing provisions under the Education Act 2002
require maintained schools and those independent schools to which we
provide funding to guard and promote the welfare of all their pupils, a
key group of whom are young carers.</p><p><a name="06101925000410"></a>I hope that I have demonstrated that,

much progress as we can.</p><p><a name="06101925000411"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew130"></a><a name="06101925001791"></a>Baroness

noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 58, I shall also
speak to Amendments Nos. 60 to 69 and 71. I shall speak briefly about
the former amendments, as the main debate should be about the ideas put
forward by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on the various experimental
admissions procedures that he proposes in his amendments, which I think
are interesting and which all seek to make admissions systems fairer in
different ways.</p><p><a name="06101925000420"></a>Amendment No.
58 seeks to make applications anonymous by removing the names of the
applicants, so that the only factors that apply are the criteria laid
down in the admissions policies set out both in the code of admissions
and by the relevant school or local education authority, whichever is
the admissions authority. Sometimes these factors are proximity, Church
membership&#151;in the case of faith schools&#151;or banding, for a
local education authority. The whole notion of anonymised admissions
means that admission cannot be influenced by preferences such as ethnic
origin, which can be told from names, or by staff acquaintance or any
other such
factor.</p><p><a name="06101925000421"></a>When
we raised this matter in Committee, I mentioned that it had been
favoured by the Commons Select Committee when it considered the White
Paper proposals. We were somewhat disappointed that the Government had
not taken up that suggestion. The Minister was surprisingly encouraging
in his response. He said on 18 July at col. 1275 of Hansard that the
Government might take up that suggestion in the future but that for the
moment it was &#147;a step too far&#148;. He saw one obstacle as
the current state of IT systems. But in all conscience, given the
number of examination papers that over the years have been submitted
and marked anonymously, I cannot see why that should pose a problem. We
realise that large IT systems have caused the Government problems but
that does not necessarily seem to inhibit them putting forward
proposals for even bigger systems; for example, the development of a
computer database itemising all children on the national
children&#146;s register and an even bigger database covering
identity cards. But in this case any such system would have to be
administered not by central government but by local authorities. A lot
of local authorities have shown themselves adept at handling the size
of database that would be
required.</p><p><a name="06101925000422"></a>The Minister also
mentioned the sibling issue. Since the Government have in their current

that seems to me irrelevant. From a personal point of view I believe
that there is a good case for giving preference to siblings. Even if
such preference were to be given, it seems to me that it could be well
handled within such a
database.</p><p><a name="06101925000423"></a>We
have retabled the amendment because we did not consider that either of
the two objections&#151;the fact that a database would be required to
handle the anonymised applications and the sibling issue&#151;held
much water. We are anxious to press the Government to give the matter a
little more consideration. As I say, in this context it might fit well
alongside one of the pilots and the various schemes suggested by the
noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I have added my name to his Amendment No. 71,
which suggests that oversubscribed state schools should allocate a
proportion of places via a ballot. We were particularly attracted to
his amendment in Committee that a school might allocate some 75 per
cent of its places on the basis of proximity or faith based criteria
and put the remaining 25 per cent up for ballot. His proposals are now
slightly different but I shall let him argue his case for
himself.</p><p><a name="06101925000424"></a>I wish to speak to
Amendments Nos. 60 to 69, including Amendments Nos. 60A and 60B, which
were originally overlooked. This whole series of amendments, which we
have tabled on behalf of the LGA, seek to amend Clause 40 to put a duty
on local authorities to produce a report on admissions rather than just
giving the power&#151;it is a question of may rather than
must&#151;to admission forums to do so. It is worth remembering that
admission forums act in effect as agencies for local government and are
composed of representatives from local schools as well as LEA
officials. Their job is to sort out admissions, given the criteria laid
down by the code of admissions and by the appropriate admission
authority at the local level. They work for and are answerable to local
government and the schools that are the admission authorities at that
level.</p><p><a name="06101925000425"></a>It is also worth
remembering that Clause 1 places a new duty on local authorities to
ensure fair access to educational opportunity. Admissions are a crucial
part of fulfilling that duty. Being required to produce a regular
report would strengthen the hand of local authorities in fulfilling
their strategic role in overseeing the fair admissions process.
Moreover, it is logical that as the body responsible for ensuring fair
access, and given that the admission forum is answerable to the local
authority, it should be the local authority rather than the admission
forum that is ultimately responsible for producing the report. It
should, of course, be written in consultation with the admission forum.
That is why we have drafted Amendment No. 60 to
read:</p><ul><a name="06101925000838"></a>&#147;A local education
authority in England, in consultation with the admission forum for that
local education authority area,
must&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000729"></a>The report
would encompass all state schools in that area including academies and
city technology colleges. In the amendments, on the one hand there is
the notion that in applying for schools the name of the child should be
taken away when they are being considered by the local admission forums
so that the application is in all respects anonymous. Secondly,

be a responsibility of the local education authority. Both seem to us
to be reasonable amendments. I hope that the Government will look
favourably on them. I beg to
move.<p><a name="06101925000426"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew134"></a><a name="06101925001795"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments Nos.
71 to 73. At present, we have a state system that is almost entirely
socially selective, or where it is not it is capable of being socially
selective. Those with money and the ability to manipulate their own
lives can choose where they live and overcome any geographical
criterion, can tutor their child or send them to private schools as the
ultimate form of tutoring to get into grammar schools, which is why
they have captured that sector of the state market, or they can, and do
in large quantities, suddenly become religious to qualify for Catholic
or Church of England schools. I observe all of this in my daily life as
editor of the <I>Good Schools Guide</I>.</p><p><a name="06101925000427"></a>I applaud parents wanting to do better
for their children. It is a great motivating force and a great good. It
is something that we should all encourage. We have let this great force
act entirely for the benefit of the people who are applying it. We
ought, ought we not, to have learnt from Adam Smith that where you have
a great force of this nature&#151;in Adam Smith&#146;s case the
desire to better oneself financially&#151;it can be harnessed to the
good of society, and then everyone benefits from it. That is really
what we ought to be trying to do in schools, and it seems to me that
there are various ways of going about it. One obvious one, which might
appeal to my Front Bench, is to allow anyone to establish a state
school whenever they wanted to; to have complete freedom of
establishment of state schools, so that if someone wanted a good state
school in an area where there was not one they could go out and
establish one. That is a fairly expensive way of doing it, but it is
certainly theoretically attractive. I do not think that it will work
with this Government, and I do not think it is on the cards in the near
future.</p><p><a name="06101925000428"></a>We
can look at improving admission arrangements to see whether we can make
sure that at least an element of them is not capable of social
manipulation, or at least is very difficult to manipulate socially. The
Government are trying this a bit through banding, but where banding has
been in place for a while, say with some of the early city technology
colleges, the middle classes are getting pretty good at working it. You
get to know the pattern, and you say to your kid, &#147;Come on, we
want you to do a bit worse than that&#148;. You make sure they get in
to band B or band C so that they can get the admissions from where you
are living. It is all a process that is capable of
manipulation.</p><p><a name="06101925000429"></a>The system that I like
is the one that is not often employed, but I came across it first with
Haberdashers&#146; Hatcham, which is one of the new academies where
they have gone for balloted admissions. If you set the bounds of your
ballot sufficiently wide&#151;Hatcham has it at three
miles&#151;you can encompass such a broad section of the population
and such a large number of houses that it becomes pretty impossible to
predict whether you will get in on a ballot from any particular 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_934"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 934</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>location. There are certainly no other known ways of working a ballot.
So you open a good school up&#151;and Haberdashers&#146; Hatcham is
a good school&#151;to anyone regardless of their ability to take
advantage of conventional means of admission. It seems to me that
ballots have the potential to open up schools in a way that grammar
schools used to; to anyone. The old grammar school system&#151;which
had many iniquities and which I did not support&#151;at least allowed
people to get on to the educational ladder from wherever they happened
to be in society. We need to produce something that has that breadth,
and ballots seem to me to be the way to do it.</p><p><a name="06101925000430"></a>Given that, how do we
get there? Amendment No. 71 is an exploration of how we get
there. I do not think you can do it straight away. You cannot come in
and suddenly say that 25 per cent of school admissions shall be by
ballot. You disturb communities too much, and you disturb reasonable
parental expectations of what the system would look like. You would
find yourself immediately unpopular with a large section of society and
it is not doable.</p><p><a name="06101925000431"></a>However, even
those who benefit most from the current system have a strong social
conscience. Many of the people who play the current system hard are
fervent <I>Guardian</I> readers with deep social consciences, who would
be delighted at the idea that they were bringing other people with them
in the success that they were finding for their children. There is no
doubt also that the breadth of middle-class England would wish to see
the whole community benefit from the sort of good schools that their
children were going to.</p><p><a name="06101925000432"></a>If
balloting is introduced gradually, and I propose that it is brought in
at 5 per cent and then in gradual 5 per cent increments&#151;although
that could be faster, but there would be no compulsion&#151;a
predictable move towards 25 per cent would be introduced and be
acceptable to those who benefit from the current system, but, within a
reasonable time in the context of educational timescales, would achieve
a much fairer admissions system.</p><p><a name="06101925000433"></a>Subsection (3) of my
amendment is concerned with grammar and faith schools. After all, by
their nature, they draw children from a wide geographical spread. Is it
enough to say that those schools should have geographical selection, as
well? I suspect that the answer is that it is not. As the Minister
knows, I do not accept the arguments made by faith schools that
admitting pupils from outside the faith destroys the faith element of
the school and I certainly do not believe that accepting pupils who are
not academically tip-top destroys the ethos of a grammar
school.</p><p><a name="06101925000434"></a>There are many
successful bilateral schools in this country where there is a strong
academic stream and an un-selected stream. They mix extremely well and,
although there is an academic ethos, such schools have the virtue of
producing a broad spread of pupils. That is a successful model; so I do
not believe that grammar schools would suffer from being required to
have balloted admissions. If it were left completely up to me, I would
probably leave out subsection (3), so that every school would have to
have unconditional ballots.</p>

at the issue from the other side. Many parents want to know where their
children are going, want to choose a good local school and do not want
to be thrown into a cauldron in which they might not be accepted by any
of the schools that they select. They want certainty. Balloted
admission systems would produce a guaranteed place for those pupils.
That, too, would be done gradually.</p><p><a name="06101925000436"></a>In good schools, all admissions would be
by guaranteed place to begin with, because everyone who lived locally
would want their children to go to a good school. You would then say to
that school, &#147;You have either to expand and take on some extra
places that, in time, would be filled by ballot, or gradually you have
to reduce the number of guaranteed places to make room for the balloted
places&#148;. Thereby, a system could evolve in which every child has
a guaranteed place and every school has approaching 25 per cent of its
places allocated by ballot. The whole system would balance between one
year and another&#151;not perfectly in any particular year but, if
there is an imbalance, it would gradually work itself out and produce a
much fairer system. The guaranteed element would thus produce a system
that would be welcome to those who did not wish to take part in a fully
balloted system.</p><p><a name="06101925000437"></a>Clearly, that
complicated system could not be enacted merely by a Back-Bench
amendment at a late stage in the Bill, but perhaps we can open things
up so that local education authorities can explore that route and
propose systems to the Government whereby these two characteristics can
be brought into play in local admission systems. Amendment No. 73 would
allow the Government to run a few pilots to see how the system would
work and, after 10 years, we could come back and say, &#147;This is
the way we want to
go&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101925000438"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew135"></a><a name="06101925001796"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is
inviting the House to reconstitute as a think tank in order to think
about particularly adventurous ways in which we might reform the
admissions system at some point in the future. I applaud him for doing
so. I assure him that he has given me a good deal of food for thought
over the past two days as I have tried to get my mind around precisely
how his system would work. I spent a lot of time trying to work out how
his system of guaranteed places, together with the ballots, might work
and how we might develop the system in due course.</p><p><a name="06101925000439"></a>Frankly, some of the suggestions put
forward by the noble Lord are valuable and I am encouraging my
department to continue to give them the attention that they merit.
However, I think he will forgive me if I say that we need to move
cautiously in this area. Taking his system of guaranteed places as an
example, we could not afford for there to be insufficient places for
children in a locality. What would be the interaction between the
guaranteed places and the ballot which he proposes? The noble Lord
wishes us to remove other criteria from school admissions&#151;I know
that he is not a great fan of faith criteria&#151;but I do not think
that he is proposing to go the whole way and remove the other 75 per
cent in schools that have a faith criteria. Therefore, the interaction
between those two would be difficult.</p>

that I have taken this issue seriously, I have looked at what it might
mean for particular local authorities and I have to say that the system
would be deeply problematic. For example, one authority that I looked
at was the London Borough of Lambeth. It was the first that came to
mind but there are many others where there might be problems. The
London Borough of Lambeth would not have nearly enough school places
for its own population if all parents there were to elect to send their
children to schools in the borough&#151;that is, if it were to try to
adopt the guaranteed place regime. There would be huge problems. For
example, in Lambeth in the admissions round that is coming
up&#151;</p><p><a name="06101925000441"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew136"></a><a name="06101925001797"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> My Lords, the Mayor of London appears in
the amendment because I know that London boroughs have that sort of
problem.</p><p><a name="06101925000442"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew137"></a><a name="06101925001798"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may just give the
facts and I shall come to the Mayor of London in a moment. There are
2,420 11 year-olds coming up in the admissions round in Lambeth but all
the Lambeth schools combined have places for only 1,672 children. I
think that about two-thirds of those places are in faith schools at the
moment, and the number of non-faith school places available in Lambeth
each year is 535.</p><p><a name="06101925000443"></a>We are seeking
substantially to boost that number. We are working very closely with
Lambeth council to establish new schools, including academies, and to
encourage more parents to send their children to local schools across
class, in exactly the way that the noble Lord wishes to see happen. We
want to improve the quality of education for all parts of the
community, but getting the balance right will be a slow process. There
are many inner-city areas where this pattern of insufficient places has
developed over the
years&#151;</p><p><a name="06101925000444"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew138"></a><a name="06101925001799"></a>Lord
Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> My Lords, it is not the
case that you cannot possibly run such an ingenious system as that put
forward by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, because some schools are faith
schools. Surely Parliament can tell faith schools what to do as much as
it can any other
school.</p><p><a name="06101925000445"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew139"></a><a name="06101925001800"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, I said that it would not be
desirable; I did not say that it was not possible. All things are
possible within an enlightened Government such as this one, but I was
saying that it would not be desirable to do so. Given that it is not
the Government's policy, nor, I believe that of Parliament, to remove
the capacity of faith schools to receive state funding, this would be a
major obstacle to being able to move in the direction favoured by the
noble Lord.</p><p><a name="06101925000446"></a>I
am a strong supporter of the Mayor of London but his capacity to wave a
magic wand in this area is going to be limited unless there is another
whole layer of education bureaucracy in London, which is what would
happen if the Mayor himself became a responsible agent in school places
planning. I think that the local authorities in London, let alone
schools, would quail

I completely understand the ideas put forward by the noble Lord but I
think that, although they may be applicable in certain circumstances,
this matter will need to continue to be debated before we can make
progress in some of the directions that he set
out.</p><p><a name="06101925000447"></a>However,
in respect of the unconditional ballots to which he referred and which
we debated in Committee, we have made a substantial indication in the
new school admissions code, which was published recently and which I
circulated to noble Lords, about the applicability of random allocation
as a legitimate over-subscription criteria for state
schools.</p><a name="06101925000730"></a>Paragraphs 2.25 to
2.27 set out the circumstances in which that can
happen:<ul><a name="06101925000839"></a>&#147;Random
allocation of school places can be good practice particularly for urban
areas and secondary
schools&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000731"></a>I believe
that is the context the noble Lord had in mind, where social
segregation can be particularly pronounced. However, it notes that it
may not be suitable in rural areas where there is not the capacity for
individuals to move so easily between
schools.<p><a name="06101925000448"></a>Paragraphs 2.26 and
2.27 set out how we believe that random allocation should
work:</p><ul><a name="06101925000840"></a>&#147;If admissions
authorities decide to use random allocation when schools are
oversubscribed they need to set out clearly how this will be operated,
and must ensure that arrangements are transparent. They should
undertake a fresh round of random allocation when deciding who should
be offered a place from a waiting list, and should not use the results
of an earlier round of random allocation, as this would disadvantage
those who had applied for a place at the school after the first random
allocation was carried
out&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000732"></a>I
cite that to show we have been giving serious thought to how this could
work in practice and the guidance that we can give to schools. We also
note that it would be desirable that admissions authorities should
ensure that random allocations are supervised by someone independent of
the school. I hope that that guidance may encourage more of the kinds
of policies cited by the noble Lord in respect of Haberdashers and that
that may create a climate in which schools are more confident in using
such unfamiliar, at present, forms of oversubscription
criteria.<p><a name="06101925000449"></a>Amendment No. 58, in
the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, to include anonymisation of
admissions applications, we still consider to be problematic. I repeat
what I said in Committee that, although I will ensure that my officials
discuss with local authorities and software suppliers whether there is
a cost-effective way to take this forward, we believe that we can move
only at the speed at which the administrative processes can
cope.</p><p><a name="06101925000450"></a>I reiterate the point
about siblings. I believe that the noble Baroness may have been under a
misunderstanding about what the school's admissions code says about
siblings. It is not correct to say that it states that the admission of
siblings is poor practice. I want to establish that clearly as it is a
very important issue for schools. Paragraphs 2.10 and 2.11 of the draft
admissions code on page 19 make it clear that siblings policies may be
reasonable. Paragraph 2.10 states:</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_938"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 938</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="06101925000841"></a>&#147;Giving priority to children who
have siblings who will be at the school when they join may support
parents of young children. Admission authorities should give
consideration particularly to the needs of younger children at primary
schools, where parents may have problems with transporting children
placed at different schools. Admissions authorities should also
carefully consider how twins or triplets or other relatives, including
those adopted, living permanently in the household will be treated if a
sibling criterion is
adopted&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000733"></a>It is not
correct to say that the draft admissions code gives advice to schools
against siblings policies. On the contrary, it says that they should
carefully consider the needs of parents, particularly in respect of
younger children, when placing children in different
schools. <p><a name="06101925000451"></a>The point which the
noble Baroness may have picked up from the media which may have led to
her remarks is that we state, in paragraphs 212 and 213, that schools
which select by ability or aptitude need to think very carefully about
whether siblings policies in those cases are blatantly unfair. They
would enable parents who have managed to get one child into the school
through a selective criterion to have all their children
admitted.</p><p><a name="06101925000452"></a>I
make that point because, as the noble Baroness knows, often in schools
with a siblings policy a high proportion of the places go to siblings.
Where there is a siblings policy, the admissions authority would need
to know the names of applicants, or it would need to have addresses
from which it could ascertain whether applicants come from the
household of a child who is already present at the school. That could
be done only by making personal information available to the admissions
authority. I elaborate that point to make it clear that there are
significant practical issues in taking forward what I accept would be
desirable in principle&#151;that admissions should be more
anonymised&#151;so that the school system is, and is seen to be,
fairer.</p><p><a name="06101925000453"></a>Amendments Nos. 60 to
69 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, would require a local
authority, in consultation with the admissions forum, to prepare and
publish reports on admissions matters in its area. There is no need to
place such a requirement on local authorities. They already have powers
to make reports as they see fit. There is no whatever limitation on a
local authority&#146;s power to act in this area. The Local
Government Association seems to want us to oblige local authorities to
do things that they are at perfect liberty to do anyway, an unusual
position for it to adopt. It is normally against us telling authorities
to do things they have the power to do or not to do. I am prepared to
rest on the maturity of local authorities to make these decisions for
themselves without us needing to tell them to do
so.</p><h5><a name="06101925000950"></a>3.45

forward and, as the Minister says, the development of the software must
take place in conjunction with local authorities. I am relieved to hear
what the Minister says about siblings. I am not sure why I got hold of
the wrong end of the stick, and am relieved because I felt that giving
no preference to siblings would have been a retrograde step. I think
some admissions authorities are moving away from giving siblings
preference at secondary school level, but I will check back and perhaps
come back to the Minister on a one-to-one basis. It would still be
possible, once siblings have been taken out of the selection process,
for over-subscription to be sorted out on a random basis. Be that as it
may, I accept that both issues currently pose something of a
problem.</p><p><a name="06101925000457"></a>I am interested to

school with a foundation&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000734"></a>We already have foundation schools, as
we know, but most of them do not actually have foundations behind them.
The model propounded here is that of a foundation school with a
foundation behind it.<p><a name="06101925000462"></a>The
Government originally proposed that, in addition to other elements of
independence, these schools should also be given freedom over their
admissions, just as current foundation, voluntary-aided and
voluntary-controlled schools have freedom over their admissions within
the general code of admissions. However, that position was
substantially modified in response to concerns expressed in the House
of Commons. In consequence, in the Bill and in the newly issued code of
admissions, we now see considerable tightening of admissions
procedures, with all kinds of practices that were allowed in the past,
such as interviewing or requiring expensive and unusual uniforms, now
regarded as bad practice. Admissions authorities are now required not
simply to have regard to the new code of admissions, but to adhere to
it.</p><p><a name="06101925000463"></a>Research
evidence, to which I referred in Committee, shows that where schools
can set their own admissions criteria, there tends to be greater
selectivity and social segregation. On Tuesday, we discussed amendments
dealing with faith schools and the problem that residential segregation
mirrored by segregation in schools leads to segregated communities. For
these reasons&#151;the changes in school structures and admission
arrangements and worries about social segregation being involved in
schools&#151;there is a strong case for commissioning a review of the
impact the changes will have; whether schools are becoming more or less
segregated as a result of the changes that will be made; whether the
new admissions arrangements are succeeding in achieving a more
equitable social mix; and whether they are throwing up other
problems.</p><p><a name="06101925000464"></a>In
Committee, the Minister agreed and said it is important that we keep
the national effects of admission arrangements under review. He then
pointed out that the schools commissioner will be required to make a
report to the Secretary of State every two years using the reports for
the local admissions forums. However, procedures got a bit muddled at
that point, and I was unable to respond to the Minister on this issue.
If I had been able to do so, I would have pointed out that the schools
commissioner, who has just been appointed, is hardly an independent
authority. The press release 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_941"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 941</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>announcing his appointment made clear that his primary role is to
support and promote the development of trust schools. Indeed, it is
notable that although the press release lists five
responsibilities&#151;promoting trust schools; identifying suitable
partners and sponsors for those schools; working with local authorities
to help them develop their role as commissioning agents for school
places; ensuring local authorities are meeting their duties to promote
parental choice, greater diversity and fair access; and working
strategically on reorganisation with a small number of local
authorities&#151;gathering admissions forum reports and reporting on
what is happening is not one of them.</p><p><a name="06101925000465"></a>I have therefore brought this amendment
back. The timescales are now realistic&#151;in Committee, I agreed
that the timescales in the original amendment were
unrealistic&#151;and I urge the Government to consider it very
seriously. They are introducing great changes, and it is right and
proper that there should be a full, independent review of those changes
after they have been made. That review cannot be independent if it is
written by someone employed by the department specifically to make
those changes happen. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101925000466"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew142"></a><a name="06101925001803"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords, I support my noble
friend Lady Sharp. I apologise for my inability to be here on the first
day of Report on this fascinating Bill. I shall be brief. My noble
friend has put her finger on a great need in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06101925000467"></a>In his interesting contribution, the
noble Lord, Lord Lucas, gave some of the reasons why an independent
review is crucial. He pointed out that how parents choose schools is
greatly affected by where they happen to live. We all know that
property around a school with a good reputation often shows a much
sharper increase in value than could be explained simply by the nature
of the territory itself. For example, in my own area, the very high
rating of a school in the league tables has led to a substantial
increase in property prices in its catchment area. That is not a good
reason for admission but one of the factors that have led to quite
sharp social distinctions between schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000468"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, also referred
to the importance of trying to move towards ballots as a way of making
admissions to schools fairer. I think that all of us recognise that the
Government have committed themselves throughout the Bill to those who
have criticised it on the grounds that admissions might once again
become selective&#151;and there are great pressures in that
direction.</p><p><a name="06101925000469"></a>A great deal of
tension is implicit in the Bill. Because of league tables and the
publication of tests, parents nowadays have a much clearer idea which
schools are doing well and which are not doing so well. Articulate and
well informed parents able to interrelate with the education system
will therefore have an informed view of what school they want their
child to attend, therefore the pressures are much more towards such
parents than ever before. Without a careful review of admissions and
the admissions structure, it will be very difficult to determine
whether 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_942"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 942</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Bill has carried out the Government&#146;s intentions. I have
always been very concerned that the pressures on the education system
after the Bill is enacted will be very hard to
reconcile.</p><p><a name="06101925000470"></a>My noble friend
suggested that there should be an admissions review. I agree with the
Minister that the original timescales were far too short. Three years
seems a very sensible period in which to determine whether what the
Government have pledged is emerging, and it is important for the
Government to commit to their own beliefs by indicating their
willingness to engage in such an independent
review.</p><p><a name="06101925000471"></a>As my noble friend Lady
Sharp pointed out, the schools commissioner is not an adequate channel
for this purpose. He is bound by the nature of his job to commit very
heavily to government policies. Therefore, the case for an independent
review, and one which brings in the groups of people my noble friend
has referred to, seems very powerful. I strongly support the case she
has made
out.</p><p><a name="06101925000472"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew143"></a><a name="06101925001804"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp,
is concerned that our proposed process for reviewing admissions
arrangements is not sufficiently robust. I hope I can satisfy her that
that is not so. First, as she said, the Bill will make the admissions
regime much tougher. The new code is much more stringent in the
requirements it places on schools and the limitations it places on
practices, such as interviewing, that we do not regard as desirable but
that none the less were taking place. Schools must act in accordance
with it; it is not sufficient for them simply to have regard to it. The
Bill strikes out certain practices, such as interviewing, that were
permissible. So the regime governing admissions is both fairer and
tougher under the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06101925000473"></a>Secondly, admissions
forums will have the power to produce a report on the effectiveness of
admissions arrangements. That will include judging the extent to which
local admission arrangements support diversity, including the ethnic
and social mix of schools. On our first day on Report I read out the
guidance given in respect of those admissions forums, which is very
clear on these duties, as is the new draft admissions code which has
come out since that guidance. Paragraph 4.10
says:</p><ul><a name="06101925000850"></a>&#147;Admissions Forums
have a key role in ensuring a fair admissions system that promotes
social equity&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000735"></a>It
goes on to say that admissions forums should assess how well the
admissions arrangements,
<ul><a name="06101925000918"></a>&#147;serve the interests of local
parents and children collectively, and try to promote agreement on
admissions
issues&#148;</ul><a name="06101925000736"></a>That is a
significant move forward from the previous
regime.<p><a name="06101925000474"></a>Thirdly, the new
school admissions code requires admission authorities to adopt
arrangements which support social cohesion and diversity. Forums will
have a new right of objection in cases where arrangements do not comply
with requirements in the code or follow its guidelines. The forums can
lodge objections with the adjudicator, which is a new power that gives
a much more immediate local response to perceived unfairness in
admissions practices than was possible before.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_943"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 943</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="06101925000951"></a>4
pm</h5><p><a name="06101925000475"></a>In
addition to those three measures, fourthly, we come to the schools
commissioner and his role in undertaking the national review of fair
admissions. The noble Baroness thinks that we do not go far enough and
proposes an independent body but, in fact, we have gone considerably
further than before. Before the appointment of the schools commissioner
with his duties in respect of fair admissions, no national body had
such responsibility, whereas under the new regime the new schools
commissioner, Sir Bruce Liddington, will take account of admission
forums&#146; reports and other data to produce a report every two
years on how local admissions support fair access. In doing so, he will
consult all the groups set out in proposed subsection (4) of the
amendment, and the Government have undertaken that we will lay his
report before Parliament, where it will be subject to the scrutiny of
both Houses when it is so
laid.</p><p><a name="06101925000476"></a>In conclusion, the time to
judge whether the regime is working is when the schools commissioner
has laid that report. I note that in her amendment the noble Baroness
does not envisage her independent review being completed within three
years anyway, so if the new regime that we intend to put in place,
which is a significant advance, is found not to be sufficiently robust,
the time to return to it is when we see how it is actually working. We
should not do what we fear would happen under the amendment: set in
place yet another layer of bureaucracy in the system, over and above
that which we are already introducing with the admissions forums and
the schools
commissioner.</p><p><a name="06101925000477"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew144"></a><a name="06101925001805"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords, before the Minister
sits down, will he address the single issue of the apparently
conflicting responsibilities that the commissioner will
have?</p><p><a name="06101925000478"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew145"></a><a name="06101925001806"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, the commissioner has a number
of responsibilities, but we do not see them as conflicting. I think
that it is a point of difference between us; we have never accepted
that the promotion of trust schools will lead to any loss of equity in
admissions in an area. On the contrary, the obligations on schools,
including trust schools, to have equitable admissions arrangements will
be stronger after the Bill than before. For example, the new trust
schools will have to act in accordance with the code of practice on
admissions, whereas all schools, including community schools, had only
to have regard to it before.</p><p><a name="06101925000479"></a>I do not accept that
there is a conflict between the different roles. On the contrary, the
expertise that the commissioner develops, which will be detailed
because of his other work involving responsibility for the operation of
the schools system locality by locality, will make him singularly well
equipped to review fair admissions. As I say, if that proves not to be
the case after the commissioner's report has been laid, it will then be
perfectly reasonable for noble Lords who are concerned to return to the
issue. I hope that the House will not prejudge the effectiveness of
that regime, which has every prospect of offering
success.</p><p><a name="06101925000480"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew146"></a><a name="06101925001807"></a>Baroness

the Minister for his response to the amendment. He says that this is a
very great advance on what has gone 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_944"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 944</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>before, but he must recognise that the Bill is
making considerable changes to the structure of both the schools system
and the admissions system. He has already noted the substantial changes
that have been taking place in the admissions
system.</p><p><a name="06101925000481"></a>I
grant that the schools commissioner will lay a report before
Parliament, but I put it to the Minister that we are calling for an
independent review, rather than for someone within the system to carry
out the review. In that sense, our proposal would not add an extra
layer of bureaucracy; it is, if I may say so, a practice used
frequently by the present Government. When you have a problem with
modern languages, you find someone to come in to do an independent
review to advise the Government. That is precisely what we are
suggesting that the Government should do. Given the substantial changes
taking place, when we see how the system is working down the line, it
should be reviewed but not by someone employed by the Department for
Education and Skills, who would be <I>parti pris</I> to what is taking
place.</p><p><a name="06101925000482"></a>There
is a very strong case for an independent review. I take on board the
Minister&#146;s point that the commissioner will have responsibility
for gathering up the local reports. The local reports are interesting,
of course, but equally they apply only to a particular locality. What
is happening in a locality is interesting, but one wants a report that
takes an overarching view of all the different areas involved and that
can draw a conclusion about how far the new code of admissions and the
new structures in schools are doing what the Government rightly say
they set up themselves. Clause 1
says:</p><ul><a name="06101925000851"></a>&#147;A local education
authority shall ensure that their functions relating to the provision
of education to which this section applies are (so far as they are
capable of being so exercised) exercised by the authority with a view
to ... promoting high
standards&#148;,</ul><a name="06101925000737"></a>and,<ul><a name="06101925000919"></a>&#147;in
the case of a local education authority in England, ensuring fair
access to educational
opportunity&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000738"></a>That
is the objective set out at the beginning of the Bill. Given the
changes the Government are making, we are asking for the chance to have
an independent review.<p><a name="06101925000483"></a>We are
not totally happy, but we take on board what the Minister says and will
think about it. We may bring this back at Third Reading but, for the
moment, I beg leave to withdraw the

they said:<ul><a name="06101925000872"></a>&#147;Schools
should take action to build staff capacity, improving the confidence of
all staff in their ability to support children with a wide range of
needs&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000740"></a>Thirdly, on
page 18, paragraph 3, they
said:<ul><a name="06101925000873"></a>&#147;The Government
shares the Committee&#146;s view that a skilled workforce is critical
to achieving the five <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes for children
and young people with SEN and/or
disabilities&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000741"></a>I agree
with all that. In Committee, when similar amendments to ours were
tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, the Minister said, at col.
330 of the <I>Official Report</I> on 5 July, that he agreed with the
underlying principles. I hope that he will forgive us today for
pressing him further. As I said, I accept that we all want to achieve
the same ends, but some of us are always asking for more and
better.<p><a name="06101925000506"></a>Amendment No. 81
proposes that professional standards for teachers at all
levels,</p><ul><a name="06101925000920"></a>&#147;should be
required to demonstrate an understanding of special educational
needs&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000742"></a>The SEN code
of practice asserts that all teachers are teachers of children with
special educational needs. But the Special Education Consortium has
concerns about how well teachers are prepared. It believes that a
compulsory element at every level of teacher training is essential to
ensure that all teachers are properly prepared for their
responsibilities and that the best way is to incorporate requirements
into professional standards at every level of the service. Noble Lords
will notice that higher level teaching assistants are included in
paragraph (e). <p><a name="06101925000507"></a>Unfortunately,
there is evidence that despite the current requirements for initial
teacher training, teachers are not sufficiently well prepared. In its
2004 report on special educational needs and disability, Ofsted
reported:</p><ul><a name="06101925000874"></a>&#147;The quality
of teaching seen on the visits for pupils with SEN was of varying
quality, with a high proportion of lessons involving pupils with SEN
having important
shortcomings&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000743"></a>In
2002, the Audit Commission
reported:<ul><a name="06101925000875"></a>&#147;Many
teachers feel under considerable pressure, on the one hand to meet the
needs of individual pupils, and on the other to deliver a demanding
national curriculum and achieve ever-better test results; research
suggests that many feel ill-equipped for this
task&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000508"></a>The difficulties
arise in respect of a number of different aspects of teaching disabled
pupils and pupils with special educational needs. For example, on
planning and monitoring progress, the same Ofsted report found that
many
schools,</p><ul><a name="06101925000921"></a>&#147;undertook
too little forward planning to ensure that provision was in place to
meet the needs of the pupils with SEN&#148;.</ul>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_948"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 948</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06101925000744"></a>In addition to concerns about the core
skills for enabling disabled pupils and those with SEN to learn and
progress, Ofsted found a lack of understanding of the requirements of
the Disability Discrimination Act in respect of the planning duties on
schools and the requirements to make reasonable adjustments for
disabled pupils. <p><a name="06101925000509"></a>We have to
accept that the solution is complex and, in many cases, quite costly.
Improved outcomes for disabled pupils and pupils with SEN are dependent
on the improved knowledge, skills and understanding of those working
with and for them. Training holds the key to that. I give every credit
to the Government for the large amount of extra money, which the
Minister mentioned, to make sure that children with special needs are
appropriately dealt with. But, as I said, earlier, we always need more
and better.</p><p><a name="06101925000510"></a>The DfES 10-year
strategy for SEN, <I>Removing Barriers to Achievement</I>, is quite
clear on what the Government want to see. It
states:</p><ul><a name="06101925000876"></a>&#147;All teachers
having the skills and confidence, and access to specialist advice where
necessary, to help children with SEN to reach their
potential&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000745"></a>The
strategy also sets out the Government&#146;s intention to work with
the Teacher Training Agency and higher education institutions to ensure
that initial teacher training in programmes for CPD provide a good
grounding in core skills and knowledge of SEN. I am aware that work has
already been commissioned by the TDA for schools to develop programmes
on SEN and disability for initial teacher training. However, sadly
these will not be compulsory and they are designed for the three and
four-year teacher training courses. That will leave teachers on the
one-year training course without this
input.<p><a name="06101925000511"></a>As the Minister pointed
out on 5 July:</p><ul><a name="06101925000877"></a>&#147;The
Secretary of State ... already have the power to set professional
standards for teachers&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/7/06;
col. 333.]</ul><a name="06101925000746"></a>&#151;and of
course does so. But I understand that the current standards for
teachers are review. Indeed, in their response to the Select Committee
on special needs the Government
said:<ul><a name="06101925000878"></a>&#147;Standards are
important, but much depends on how they are achieved in
practice&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000747"></a>Will the
Minister examine with the TDA, institutes of higher education, Ofsted
and other relevant bodies how SEN and disability can be incorporated
into the full range of training, in particular the one-year
postgraduate teacher training courses where there is very little time
to devote to it, and I do not underestimate the challenge of that
fact.<p><a name="06101925000512"></a>I turn now to Amendment
No. 82. This amendment would strengthen the existing duty on local
authorities to provide special education, explicitly stating that a
range of different types of provision is required. It would also
require local authorities to report on how this range of provision
meets the range of special educational needs which exist in its own
local area. For example, although it is unlikely, if an authority were
to rely entirely either on inclusion in mainstream or on special
schools, it must justify that decision. So I should like to question
the 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_949"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 949</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government further on securing access to a range of
special educational provision and how the guidance they have announced
will achieve
this.</p><p><a name="06101925000513"></a>While
the Bill aims for choice and diversity in provision for children
without disabilities, that is not a reality for many parents of
children with autism or other disabilities unless adequate and
appropriate specialist and mainstream places are available in their
area. A recent report by the National Autistic Society entitled <I>Make
School Make Sense</I> found three things: first, that 66 per cent of
parents believe their choice was constrained by a lack of provision;
secondly, that half of parents believed their child&#146;s current
placement was not the best school for them; and, thirdly, that 30 per
cent of secondary school pupils with autism have to travel out of their
local authority to access a suitable school. I accept that,
realistically, it is sometimes the best choice for them. As a result of
these findings, <I>Make School Make Sense</I> called for a range of
provision to be enshrined in legislation. The House of Commons
Education and Skills Select Committee has endorsed that recommendation,
stating:</p><ul><a name="06101925000879"></a>&#147;The Government
should ... implement a statutory requirement for local authorities
to maintain a broad-ranging and flexible continuum of provision which
should be monitored on a regular
basis&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000514"></a>Current
law requires local authorities to have regard to the need to ensure
that special education provision is secured for pupils who have special
educational needs. It does not of course specify what sort of provision
is made, and it is right and proper that that is left to local
authorities to decide, based on local need, as long as the provision is
of sufficiently high quality. The Government&#146;s recent response
to the Select Committee&#146;s report agreed that access to a range
of provision is a desirable goal, but stated strongly that it is the
role of local authorities rather than central government to decide on
the organisation of special education provision in the area. I agree
with the Government on that. The amendment is not intended to restrict
local authorities but to present a way of ensuring that provision meets
local needs and is reported on to demonstrate how these needs are
met.</p><p><a name="06101925000515"></a>Local
authorities vary enormously in how they provide and I believe this
matter should be in the public domain. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord
Dearing, drew attention to it at Committee stage. For example, there is
almost a fivefold difference in the proportion of pupils with
statements in different authorities, from 1.08 per cent of all pupils
having statements in Nottinghamshire to 4.83 per cent in Halton in
Cheshire. In addition, the percentage of pupils placed in maintained
special schools varies from zero to 60 per cent across different local
authorities. The percentage in mainstream schools varies from 19 to 73
per cent. The variation across local authorities in placing pupils in
independent special schools runs from 0.4 per cent to over 19 per cent.
This is a remarkable level of variation and demonstrates the extent to
which local authorities decide their own strategies for the provision
for children with SEN.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_950"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 950</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101925000516"></a>In 2002, the Audit Commission believed
that this was an unacceptable level of variation in provision between
different parts of the country and stated that it continued to
be,</p><ul><a name="06101925000922"></a>&#147;especially
concerned about pupils with low incidence needs (such as autism and
multi-sensory impairment) and those with a disability, who are
potentially the most disadvantage pupils in the educational
system&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000748"></a>In 2004,
Ofsted echoed that concern. It found that lack of strategic planning
was common and services available in any one area varied
considerably.<p><a name="06101925000517"></a>There
are many examples of very good practice and I will give one. As noble
Lords might expect, it is a Liberal Democrat council&#151;Liverpool.
Over the past five years there have been enormous changes in Liverpool.
They began by Liverpool being cited by the Centre of Studies on
Inclusive Education as the least inclusive local authority in the
country because it had a higher proportion of children in special
schools than elsewhere. It believed that this was too simplistic an
analysis; however, very serious attention was paid to what could be
done. Of serious concern at that time were the 600 pupils in moderate
learning difficulty schools. They were no less able than many pupils in
mainstream. Their special school status was often based on parental
pressure, on mainstream school rejection or a response to bullying,
which should have been dealt with by the mainstream school. Some among
them had more complex learning needs but many passed a number of GCSEs.
Ofsted particularly identified this group as being educated separately
for no good
reason.</p><p><a name="06101925000518"></a>Liverpool&#146;s
revised policy contains the following elements. It statements only
where necessary. It says why go through the process with a deaf child
when their special need is quite obvious; you should simply access the
appropriate school place without delay, and that is what it did. It has
also returned pupils from expensive out of city places where their
needs can be met locally with some support. It has paid a lot of
attention to early intervention and some early years assessment
provision has been relocated into mainstream sites, where separate
education assessment can take place but opportunities for integration
in selective classroom situations can be maximised. It has developed 20
resource bases, which are frequently identified by Ofsted as excellent,
five resource-plus schools encapsulated within mainstream sites,
several reserved bases for SEN on mainstream sites, pupil referring
services and services for children with social and behavioural
problems. Liverpool has not had a dogmatic special schools or not
special schools approach; it has assessed individual needs and matched
provision
accordingly.</p><p><a name="06101925000519"></a>The
glue that cements all this together is the &#163;1.4
million that funds the special schools to provide outreach support to
the mainstream schools and their learning networks. While the press and
some of us politicians bicker about inclusion, Liverpool is one of a
number of authorities that has got on with assessing children and
meeting their needs. The amount of money spent on SEN has kept well in
line with inflation, if not exceeded
it.</p><p><a name="06101925000520"></a>What is as important as all
these structural things is that individual schools have a culture of
inclusion and communicate that to the children. Only this morning I
heard about a school where sixth-form 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_951"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 951</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pupils were encouraged to sit with some of the children with special
needs lower down the school. That had great benefits for all of them;
being closer in age, they could identify with each other quite well. It
did the children with special needs good and helped the sixth formers
to understand and help children with special needs. Indeed, one or two
of them went on to work with children with special
needs.</p><p><a name="06101925000521"></a>Amendment
No. 82B would not just require that all SEN co-ordinators were
qualified teachers with an understanding of legislation relevant to the
post and experience to support them; it would also ensure that they
were part of the school&#146;s senior management team and received
appropriate ongoing training. A consensus has emerged on the value that
the role of SEN co-ordinator brings to a school when the person is
authoritative and informed. This is a probing amendment to confirm the
Government&#146;s intentions regarding SENCOs following their
response to the Education and Skills Committee report on SEN. The part
of the response that said that the person taking on the lead
responsibility should be a teacher and a member of the senior
leadership team in the school was most welcome. In addition, the letter
of the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, to the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe,
of 12 October made it clear that the Government intend SENCOs to be
teachers.</p><p><a name="06101925000522"></a>Government
Amendment No. 140 requires governing bodies to appoint a SENCO to
co-ordinate the provision of education for children with SEN and gives
the Secretary of State a power to make regulations relating to the
role. However, the National Autistic Society and the Special
Educational Consortium are still keen to receive assurances from the
Minister, which I hope he can give us today, that the language of the
legislation will be clear in stating that a SENCO must be not just a
teacher but a member of the senior leadership team of the school. When
he speaks to Amendment No. 140, it will be useful to hear more about
the Government&#146;s planned requirements for the role.</p><p><a name="06101925000523"></a>I am sorry that I have spoken for so
long, but I cannot resist having a very brief word about the excellent
amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, in particular
Amendment No. 117A. I have no doubt that, when she speaks to it, she
will remind noble Lords that many young people who are excluded from
school have special educational needs or disabilities. It is not fair
that the provision that the school has been making for a child is
judged along with that child when exclusion is considered. For many
children, exclusion is partly due to the fact that they have not been
provided for appropriately in the school, and have kicked out in
response. However, I leave that to what will no doubt be an excellent
speech by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton. I beg to move.

Buscombe:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments
Nos. 117 and 125. The amendments address real and, I am certain,
unintended consistencies in provision for children with special needs
in mainstream schooling. Amendment No. 117 is a new amendment tabled to
address the inconsistency in discipline guidelines for children with
special needs in mainstream schools as opposed to special
schools.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_952"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 952</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101925000525"></a>Existing guidance
discriminates against SEN children in mainstream schools. There are two
main pieces of guidance dealing with physical restraint. Circular 10/98
gives guidance on physical restraint in all schools. It clarifies the
acceptable use of reasonable physical force, recommends that schools
have a specific policy on restraint, which parents must be informed
about, recommends that schools keep records of physical restraint and
states that, normally, only authorised staff are allowed to use
restraint and that training or guidance may be needed for teachers.
However, there is a separate set of guidance for teachers in special
schools. The document is called <I>Guidance on the Use of Restrictive
Physical Interventions for Staff Working with Children and Adults who
Display Extreme Behaviour in Association with Learning Disability
and/or Autistic Spectrum Disorders</I>. However, in spite of its title,
it deals only with SEN children in special schools. The introduction
states:</p><ul><a name="06101925000880"></a>&#147;Whilst ...
this guidance will have wider relevance and implications for children
in mainstream schools ... this guidance is not intended to cover
all forms of extreme behaviours in all
schools&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000526"></a>What is more,
the 2002 guidance for SEN children in special schools
states:</p><ul><a name="06101925000881"></a>&#147;Staff who are
expected to employ restrictive physical interventions will require
additional, more specialised
training&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000527"></a>There is
clearly a huge disparity between disciplinary provision for children
with special needs in mainstream provision and in SEN schooling. This
inconsistency needs to be addressed. I am concerned that Sir Alan Steer
was instructed not to look at SEN discipline provision in his report on
discipline. I fear that this has severe ramifications for the
effectiveness of this Bill's
provisions.</p><p><a name="06101925000528"></a>The freer use of
&#147;reasonable force&#148; and the clarification achieved by this
Bill is welcome. However, teachers who are not trained to deal with the
specific disciplinary problems associated with special needs and
behavioural problems are at a disadvantage, and the children with whom
they deal are at risk of completely unintentional mishandling, which
can be of great detriment to their personal
development.</p><p><a name="06101925000529"></a>I must make it
absolutely clear that I warmly applaud the fantastic job that teachers
do educating children with special needs alongside their mainstream
duties. Their forbearance and sensitivity sets an example to us all. My
amendment would ensure that their efforts are well prepared for and
well supported in both training and continual professional
development.</p><p><a name="06101925000530"></a>The second
amendment will ensure that children with special educational needs who
are excluded from schools are not placed in other schools until their
statement has been reassessed in the light of their progress or lack
thereof. There is a disparity between the provisions of this Bill and
the requirements of the 1996 Education Act, which requires an amended
statement for the child to designate a suitable school for them to
attend. The process must now involve 15 days of consultation, followed
by a maximum eight-week period during which the proposed statement must
be put forward. That is a confusing message for parents, teachers and
local authorities, 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_953"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 953</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which, under this Bill, must provide a new school place for children
within five days. Parents acting under the 1996 Act would be culpable
under this Bill. It is often the case that children with statements may
well be better provided for at home during the
interim.</p><p><a name="06101925000531"></a>I made clear in
Committee and on the previous grouping the urgent need for a review on
the provision for special needs students. This amendment would stop the
placement of excluded pupils in schools that are not equipped to deal
with those students and stem the potentially harmful effect of that on
the children
themselves.</p><p><a name="06101925000532"></a>We
welcome the new amendments that the Minister has brought forward
following the Education and Skills Committee&#146;s report. It is
right to devote resources to continuing professional development. The
mandatory training for new special educational needs
co-ordinators&#151;SENCOs&#151;and the new requirement that they
must be teachers represent a positive step in the right direction to
ensure that the people dealing with pupils with special educational
needs have adequate training. That is only right and, I am pleased to
say, in accordance with the considered opinion of the Education and
Skills Committee, in its recommendations 84 and
85.</p><p><a name="06101925000533"></a>I hope
also that a dyslexia trust to which local authorities and schools may
bid for funding to support higher-level specialist teacher training
will help those schools that need that extra support. I would be
grateful, however, if the Minister could inform the House of the
background to the establishment of such a trust, and the estimated
costs.</p><p><a name="06101925000534"></a>I hope that the Minister
can take on board these suggestions as part of a much wider
reassessment of special educational
needs.</p><p><a name="06101925000535"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew153"></a><a name="06101925001814"></a>Lord
Rix:</b> My Lords, I fear that much of what I have to
say may already have been touched on, but perhaps the rule of three
that applies in comedies to happy endings will apply if I repeat what
has already been said, as it might lead to the Minister agreeing to
Amendment No. 81 when he sums up.</p><p><a name="06101925000536"></a>The vast majority of
children with special educational needs&#151;all but 100,000 out of
1.4 million children&#151;are educated in mainstream schools. It is
therefore vital that we concentrate on SEN provision across mainstream
schools, and I am delighted that this group of amendments does just
that. It is in that context that I add my support particularly to
Amendment No. 81 on professional standards for teachers in all schools.
This amendment reflects nothing more than common sense, and the fact
that it does not already reflect reality is quite astonishing. Indeed,
it should not really be incumbent on those of us who support the
amendment to make a case in its favour; rather, we need to be told why
education professionals&#151;teaching assistants, teachers, head
teachers and others not mentioned in this amendment, such as choice
advisers&#151;should not be trained as a matter of course in the
needs of the 1.4 million pupils who have special educational needs,
only around a quarter of a million of them having a statement of
SEN.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_954"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 954</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101925000537"></a>Those who work in
special schools already receive such training, but 60 per cent of
pupils with statements of SEN are in mainstream schools, and over 15
per cent of all mainstream pupils have identified SEN. That means that
every single teacher, not just teachers in special schools, can expect
to come into contact with pupils with SEN on a regular basis, probably
on every single day of their working lives. If they are not given
adequate training on the specific special needs of these pupils, we
cannot expect them to deal adequately with them. Those pupils will be
let down. They will not be properly taught and they will not reach
their full potential. Their teachers will be let down, because they
will be unable to teach all their pupils as they would wish to. Other
pupils will be let down, because their classes will include children
whose needs are not properly met. If every child matters,
then&#151;to coin a phrase&#151;every disabled child matters.
Teacher training must be about every child, and therefore about every
disabled child and every child with
SEN.</p><p><a name="06101925000538"></a>Appropriate training is not
a question of adding an SEN module at some point in the teacher
training curriculum. It is about ensuring that SEN and disability are a
thread running through teacher training. It is also about making sure
that teachers&#146; ongoing professional training and development
days&#151;what used to be called &#147;Baker
days&#148;&#151;continue to cover SEN and disability, to ensure
that teachers are kept up to date on relevant developments on the best
ways to teach the disabled pupils and pupils with SEN in their classes.
Perhaps such days, if they focused on this area, could be called
&#147;Adonis
days&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101925000539"></a>There are plenty
of reasons why the Government make local authorities responsible for
SEN, and some of those reasons may even be good. But that makes it all
the more important that local authorities have the resources to meet
their responsibility to deliver good SEN provision. The best resources
for delivering good education are good teachers, and so we come full
circle. To deliver a good education to all disabled children and
children with SEN, teachers&#151;all teachers&#151;need to be
trained appropriately.</p><p><a name="06101925000540"></a>One
important feature of such training will be discipline and physical
restraint, and it is in that context that I turn briefly to Amendment
No. 117. Too often, standard disciplinary procedures do not adequately
address the needs of pupils with SEN. Indeed, on many occasions,
disciplinary problems may arise out of poor support and lack of
understanding, rather than simply from a pupil with SEN being badly
behaved. That lack of support and understanding may be addressed in
large part by the SEN and disability training that I have discussed in
relation to Amendment No. 81, but it is vital that discipline is
addressed in its own right. While physical restraint of any child is
something on which clear training and guidance should be in place, the
physical restraint of disabled children may have particular health and
safety implications of which all relevant staff should be made fully
aware.</p><p><a name="06101925000541"></a>Noble Lords would not

Walmsley.</p><p><a name="06101925000543"></a>I need to declare an
interest as someone who works closely with I CAN, the charity for
children with communication difficulties, and with NCH, both of which
have schools for children with special educational needs and
disabilities. I am grateful to the Special Educational Needs Consortium
for providing me with briefing for these
debates.</p><p><a name="06101925000544"></a>In
common with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, I return to this matter
in the hope of pushing the Government further on it. I am very
concerned about the alarming proportion of excluded children with
special educational needs, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said.
It is both fair and sensible that the support afforded these children
is assessed as part of the decision on whether they should or should
not be excluded. I am not sure that what I propose is as yet
encompassed in the Government&#146;s policies or in the Bill, but we
need to ensure that any disabled pupil or any pupil with SEN has a
review before they are permanently excluded from school. That review
should make a judgment on whether they have been treated in an
appropriate fashion. That is obvious and sensible because if schools
are not providing the right support for a child, why would we want them
to continue to provide the wrong support? That would result in
generations of children suffering terrible consequences from not
receiving appropriate support. One of the ways to assess that is to
take a view on whether the treatment or support they have received is
appropriate for their
condition.</p><p><a name="06101925000545"></a>I am also concerned
about the experience of children and parents. It is very demoralising
and depressing for parents to discover that their child is setting off
on the wrong path, sometimes at a terribly early age while still in
primary school, because of the lack of support they are given at the
age of eight, nine or 10. How will those children fare in secondary
schools? The incidence of excluded pupils in secondary schools,
particularly young men, can probably be traced back to the wrong
support being given in primary school. I differ with the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on the attendant cost of that. The cost to
society of those young people, particularly the young men, falling out
of the system is very high. They often end up in the youth justice
system and will certainly be socially excluded in some way or
other.</p><p><a name="06101925000546"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew155"></a><a name="06101925001816"></a>Baroness

accept the point that the noble Baroness makes that in the long term it
is a very cost-effective way of spending
money.</p><p><a name="06101925000547"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew156"></a><a name="06101925001817"></a>Baroness

assess what it costs. I pose a few questions that might help in that
regard.</p><p><a name="06101925000548"></a>First,
can the Government assure us that future investigations into behaviour
issues in schools will take full account of pupils with disabilities
and special educational needs, as set out explicitly in Sir Alan
Steer&#146;s report on learning behaviour? Secondly, will the
Government keep a close eye on the statistics on exclusions of children
with disabilities and special educational needs year on year, to
provide a clear picture of the pattern of such exclusions and the
impact of the measures that the Government are implementing?</p><p><a name="06101925000549"></a>Thirdly, if the
Government engage in further investigation and research into the
pattern of exclusions among children with disabilities and special
educational needs, will they ensure that they gather the information
from the parents and families of those children and from the children
themselves? Finally, if the Government carry out further research and
survey work on exclusions among children with disabilities and special
educational needs, can they assure us that the findings of this
research will inform the inclusion development programme as discussed
in the government response to the Education and Skills Select Committee
report on special educational
needs?</p><h5><a name="06101925000953"></a>4.45

Government have said in their reply to the Select Committee about
initial teacher training. I am less reassured, although the intentions
are good, about what is to be done about continuing professional
development in this area. I have seen that the Government have in mind
to explore with Ofsted how the school evaluation framework can be used
to ensure that teachers get the CPD that they need&#151;good. They
give a prompt that is much needed in some schools to realise the
Government&#146;s aspirations. When I read in the department&#146;s
inclusion development programme that it will help transform
understanding of SEN and disability in schools, on one hand I am
delighted, but on the other hand I am concerned that there is need for
such a transformation. Earlier in the debate, we heard a reference to
Adam Smith&#146;s hidden hand&#151;how self-interest can work to
the public good. The great man had a good deal to say about that. The
amendment brings in the hidden hand of self-interest to the public
good. It is a rather wise thing to do.</p>

Darcy de Knayth:</b> My Lords, I can be extremely
brief. I have also added my name to Amendment No. 81, which the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, so comprehensively introduced and which is now
being so thoughtfully backed up by other noble Lords from every side of
the House. Of course, it is very important that teachers at all levels
should have a full understanding of this. I very much underline what
the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said about the one-year training of
postgraduate teachers. They should have a full understanding not only
of pupils&#146; needs but of SEN and disability law, which is very
complicated; of their duties; and also of the judgment on what
constitutes discrimination. The GTC
said:</p><ul><a name="06101925000882"></a>&#147;The Council is
disturbed by the scant attention given to special educational needs and
argues that expertise needs to be developed right across the education
service, for all staff. Similarly, schools&#146; statutory duties to
promote and implement race and sex equality and to combat disability
discrimination need to be placed at the centre of the
Government&#146;s
agenda&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000556"></a>I
was then going to turn to the major bit of my speech, about Amendments
Nos. 115A, 116A and 117A, which were so well introduced by the noble
Baroness, but, remarkably, her brain also conjured up the four
questions that I was going to ask afterwards. I hope that I can give
added weight to the fact that many people are thinking of these
questions to ask the Minister. Perhaps he will at least undertake a
review and will comply with the four criteria. I also welcome his
statement about the SENCO, but again with the proviso that the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, mentioned of the Special Educational
Consortium.</p><p><a name="06101925000557"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew162"></a><a name="06101925001823"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I wish to add my
enthusiasm for the amendments in this group, in particular Amendments
Nos. 81 and 117. It is important that all teachers have that basic
training. Furthermore, not only teachers should have it as a much wider
group will be in contact with the children. That applies also in making
an early assessment, where one has not already taken place, of children
in this group, as they may not have been recognised as such at that
stage.</p><p><a name="06101925000558"></a>I particularly commend
the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton. As has been
pointed out, the percentage of children with special educational needs
who have been excluded from school is appalling. That figure alone is
enough to rock us back on our heels and make us realise that we are not
doing anything like enough about it. Many of those children, if treated
in the wrong way, will end up in prison. We know that that is the case
from the number of young people in prisons who should not be there
anyhow and who are handled, including physically, in the wrong
way.</p><p><a name="06101925000559"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew163"></a><a name="06101925001824"></a>Lord
Dearing:</b> My Lords, I rise for a second time
because I spoke to Amendment No. 80 but am now prompted to see that two
other amendments in this group are in my name and that of the noble
Lord, Lord Lucas. I had therefore better do something about
them.</p><p><a name="06101925000560"></a>In
Committee, I represented, as did the Select Committee, that there
should be a separation of the judgment of what a child&#146;s needs
were in special 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_958"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 958</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>education from the management of money and the constraints that that
imposed on decision-takers. Bringing the two together causes a risk
that the first will be moderated by the second. In response, the
Minister referred to the importance of not taking away major
responsibilities from local authorities, which by implication my
amendment did, and said that it was unreasonable to expect anyone to
sign a blank cheque. In response, I said something to the effect that I
understood that the matter could not be taken on the hoof and that,
having listened to the Minister, I was not in the business of parading
half-baked solutions. Needless to say, I was tempted by the leisure
offered by the Recess to offer the Minister some solutions. I am proud
of them, but I realise that our idea of separation is complex. Although
I am, and have been for many years, a quango person, I was reluctant to
propose another one.</p><p><a name="06101925000561"></a>My initial
idea to transfer responsibility for assessment to local health
authorities seemed a good one and would not have created another
quango. However, I found that they also were affected by monetary
considerations. So that idea did not work. I thought then of the care
commission, which certainly is not influenced by monetary
considerations, as I know from its very searching requirements for
certain classes of care home. I considered the commission, but I do not
know enough about it.</p><p><a name="06101925000562"></a>So I
thought that I would go for the simple solution, to place a statutory
duty on those charged with responsibility for considering what a
child&#146;s needs are, but to do it without regard to financial
considerations although it would remain within the local
authority&#146;s ambit. It would then be for the local authority to
decide what financial response it thought fit and right to make in all
the relevant circumstances.</p><p><a name="06101925000563"></a>I
suggest that, once a year, those charged with making assessments should
make an observation or commentary on what they feel about the response
from the local authority so that it is publicly accountable for its
decisions. Thus, there would be separation but the local authority
would be fully able and responsible for taking the final decisions and
would be held accountable for them. That is the first part of my
proposals but I have a supplementary
one.</p><p><a name="06101925000564"></a>The Minister very kindly
wrote to me about representations that I made in Committee about the
difficulties that parents sometimes have in coping with the official
documents that they receive from local authorities. He referred me to
the Parent Partnership service, which, I confess, I did not know about,
and I suspect that a large number of other people do not know about it
either. So I made some inquiries at an excellent local authority about
this body. I found that it is located in one office in one part of a
large area and that its funding, shared over the population, amounts to
25p per head. I then made some further inquiries and asked how much the
figure would work out at if&#151;although this is not always the
case&#151;it was concerned only with special educational needs. The
figure was much better&#151;14p a head. But when I think of all the
overhead costs incurred by any public body, I wonder how much time a
parent perplexed by the system could expect to have.</p>

proposal: first, that very early in a letter to any parent, the local
authority should draw attention to the Parent Partnership service with
an address and telephone number; and, secondly, that the local
authority should have a duty to see that it is adequately funded. It
should all be left with the local
authority.</p><p><a name="06101925000566"></a>I
remind the Minister that we all know, with sadness, that 20 per cent of
people leave school functionally illiterate. When you receive a letter
which, however well intentioned the official may be, has had to go
through the lawyers to ensure that it is okay, the result is not
readily accessible to parents who have left school functionally
illiterate. Those who suffer are the children, and it is our job to
ensure that children who have special needs through no fault of their
own are not disadvantaged because their parents are unable to respond,
as the middle-class parents are able to do, to this kind of document.
They need real
help.</p><p><a name="06101925000567"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew164"></a><a name="06101925001825"></a>Lord

81.</p><p><a name="06101925000568"></a>I welcome the increased
resources that the Government have given this issue but, as a primary
school governor and a grandparent with a granddaughter who has been
diagnosed as having Asperger&#146;s syndrome, I can attest to a
significant variation in the quality of education delivered in
mainstream schools. At my local primary school, the SENCO is well
trained and is a part of the senior team, and governors receive regular
reports on SEN provision.</p><p><a name="06101925000569"></a>However, my granddaughter's experience
has been mixed. Due to the influence of a very sympathetic head
teacher, one small village primary school was a good example of
inclusion in a mainstream school. At her current secondary school, the
experience is not as positive. More training seems to be needed, and
there needs to be an understanding that children with SEN have to adapt
to a very different and challenging environment in a secondary school.
They face a range of teachers where, in a private school, they had one
who came to understand their needs well. There are increased homework
demands, but there is a need to take into account the varied abilities
of children with special educational needs. I hope the Minister takes
into account that while we have put in more resources, we still have a
problem with variation in the quality of provision. The points made on
the Parent Partnership are
valid.</p><p><a name="06101925000570"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew165"></a><a name="06101925001826"></a>Baroness

Lord Rix, how to pay a delightful compliment. I think they would go
down very badly in schools where they would conjure up all the wrong
images. At least &#147;Baker days&#148; conjured up a worthwhile
profession, whereas I suspect that &#147;Adonis days&#148; would
conjure up narcissism and a complete inability for the reality to live

Hurdle. I feel as though I have spent the whole afternoon running that
race and I have a number of hurdles still to go. For any noble Lords
who were hoping to make a quick buck, the price was 33-1, so I do not
think they would have done very
well.</p><p><a name="06101925000574"></a>I start with the crucial
role of special educational needs co-ordinators in schools, an issue to
which we paid a great deal of attention following the report of the
Select Committee on special educational needs. I shall speak to
government Amendments Nos. 140, 144 and 153 which concern the crucial
role of SENCOs.</p><p><a name="06101925000575"></a>The central
importance of the SENCO to good SEN provision was recognised by the
Education and Skills Committee in its report on SEN. The committee
recommended that SENCOs should, in all cases, be qualified teachers, in
a senior management position in a school and it emphasised the
importance of training for SENCOs. Government Amendments Nos. 140, 144
and 153 are introduced to implement that recommendation.</p><p><a name="06101925000576"></a>In Amendment No. 82B, the noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley, seeks to ensure that the lead SENCO role will fall to a
teacher. While government Amendment No. 140 refers to a SENCO as a
&#147;member of staff&#148;, I can give the House a categorical
assurance that our intention, through regulations under the amendments
I have moved, is to provide that the SENCO role should rest with a
teacher. I also assure the House that the regulations will require
SENCOs to be members of the senior leadership team in a school, as
recommended by the committee.</p><p><a name="06101925000577"></a>Under the regulation-making power that we
are taking with these amendments, we will also institute more
consistent standards for SENCOs supported by nationally accredited
training, which will be a requirement for all newly appointed SENCOs to
undertake after a date that we shall determine. As a first step towards
that, we have commissioned the Training and Development Agency to
develop a 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_961"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 961</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>revised statement of the knowledge, skills and experience required of
those leading special educational needs and disabilities provision in
schools and a framework of standards for that role. This will help to
inform our understanding about the level at which tasks should be
performed and the type of nationally accredited training we will
therefore provide. I believe that this will be a very major advance to
the quality of training and support for special educational needs in
schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000578"></a>Although that
represents a direction in respect of schools&#151;we are very
reluctant to direct schools&#151;my own experience over the years has
taught me that there is no more important role in a school, not only in
the direct provision of special educational needs, but also in
simulating a culture of support for SEN and training to fulfil
obligations for SEN, than the role of the SEN co-ordinator. I therefore
hope that the House will agree that this represents an effective
response to the committee, and a significant step forward.</p><p><a name="06101925000579"></a>On Amendment No. 81&#151;also in the
name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley&#151;on professional
standards, we agree that it is important for all those who work closely
with children to be properly equipped to deal with special educational
needs and disability. The Secretary of State already has the power to
set professional standards for teachers, and currently does so in
secondary legislation and associated guidance. There is no need to set
out specific standards in primary legislation, especially as doing so
may reduce the flexibility needed to reflect developments over
time.</p><p><a name="06101925000580"></a>We take the issue of SEN
and disability in professional standards seriously. The noble Baroness
asked where we were on the current standards revision. A consultation
on the revised standards for qualified teacher status has recently been
completed and there are standards which relate to SEN and disability
issues in the proposed revisions, which are more stringent than those
they replace.</p><p><a name="06101925000581"></a>Much depends on
how these standards are put into practice. That is why, as part of our
response to the Select Committee, we have asked Ofsted to carry out a
thematic review of the journey the intending teacher takes through
initial teacher training and induction in relation to SEN and
disability. That is in addition to the work we are doing with the
Teacher Training and Development Agency on a &#163;1.1 million
package of practical initiatives to strengthen the training teachers
receive in SEN and disability. In our response to the Select Committee,
we also announced that we are this year embarking on a national
programme of continuing professional development for staff.</p><p><a name="06101925000582"></a>Amendment No. 82 seeks to confer a duty
on local authorities to secure a range of SEN provision. Section 14 of
the Education Act 1996 relates to all schools, including special
schools, and lays a duty on local authorities to secure sufficient
schools for the provision of primary and secondary education. Section
14(6) says that, in exercising their functions to secure sufficient
primary and secondary education, local authorities must have regard to
the need for securing special educational provision for pupils with 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_962"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 962</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>special educational needs. Those pupils include children with and
without statements and with a variety of special educational needs,
ranging from moderate to severe and complex. Local authorities must
already, therefore, secure a range of provision.</p><p><a name="06101925000583"></a>On the publication of information, my
department collects information on the range of SEN provision in
localities each year, and publishes information on the numbers of
different types of the school and different pupils in each type of
school in each local authority area. That is available on my
department&#146;s website. In addition, the DfES annually publishes
data for each authority, showing the number of children with statements
of special educational needs and where they are placed. Data is also
published on children with statements who are educated other than in
school, and on those who are awaiting provision. This data is also
available on the DfES
website.</p><p><a name="06101925000584"></a>Amendment No. 141 is in
the name of the noble Lords, Lord Dearing and Lord Lucas, on the
assessments and statements system. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, is now
setting himself up as one of a two-person think tank on a challenging
issue which we recognise needs continued thought. I have given careful
consideration to his amendment, which seeks to ensure that assessments
are carried out without considerations of
finance.</p><p><a name="06101925000585"></a>The
present arrangements require local authorities first and foremost to
focus on carefully establishing a child&#146;s special educational
needs so they can make appropriate provision to meet their individual
needs. At the point of carrying out a statutory assessment, they must
seek advice from the child&#146;s school, their educational
psychologist, social services, health professionals and, of course, the
child&#146;s parents. Advice is given independently and without
consideration of finance. Indeed, paragraph 7.79 of the special
educational needs code of practice, to which all local authorities must
have regard by law, makes it clear that:</p><ul><a name="06101925000883"></a>&#147;Those giving advice may comment
on the amount of provision they consider appropriate. Thus LEAs should
not have blanket policies that prevent those giving advice from
commenting on the amount of provision they consider a child
requires&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000749"></a>If, having
considered the assessment advice, the local authority decides to make a
statement, it must specify appropriate provision for each identified
need. As guardians of public funds, local authorities have duties not
to incur unreasonable public expenditure and to use their resources
efficiently in the context of meeting the identified needs of the child
in question. This seems to be the right balance. It is difficult to see
how the duties set out in the amendment could be reconciled with the
duty of local authorities not to incur unreasonable public expenditure
unless we were somehow able to provide unlimited resources.
<p><a name="06101925000586"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, is the last
person to seek to encourage us to do things that are impractical and
unattainable and subsections (2) and (3) of his new clause therefore
seek to cover this point. The issue with those subsections is that by
saying that a local authority
may,</p><ul><a name="06101925000923"></a>&#147;decide in the
light of findings the extent of financial support to be
provided&#148;,</ul>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_963"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 963</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06101925000750"></a>may simple reconstitute the current
system in which the local authority has to decide how to meet the
assessment within the resources it has available. It is not clear to me
that the amendment is an improvement. Subsection (3) is genuinely
ingenious and provides for cost-sharing between local and central
government in respect of particularly high-cost placements. He
specifies individual cases likely to exceed &#163;50,000 or
&#163;100,000 a year. I can see some merit in that proposal, but our
concern is that it might have the effect of encouraging local
authorities to make perverse decisions in respect of placements that
are not necessarily in the best interests of children because they
would know that by making more expensive placements, they would be able
to pass on a significant proportion of the costs to central government
rather than having to meet them entirely through the decisions they
make in respect of provision.
<p><a name="06101925000587"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, also tabled
Amendment No. 142, which concerns parent partnership services. I am
glad that he believes that they have an important role to play, and we
agree with him. As to funding for parent partnership services, it is
for elected local authorities to determine how best to deliver their
statutory functions, including parent partnership services, within the
overall funding available for school pupils from the department.
However, in our response to the Select Committee, we made clear our
intention to set clear expectations about how local authorities should
meet the national standards for parent partnership services set out in
the SEN code of practice, which include ensuring adequate funding.
These expectations, which we will set out in due course, will include
parent partnership services having their own budget, a management group
with independent representation, links to children&#146;s information
services and choice advisers, locating parent partnership services away
from SEN casework teams, independent training for parent partnership
service co-ordinators, access to independent parental support and a
voice for parent partnership services in local children&#146;s
services policy development. Those requirements being set out more
clearly will help the more effective development of parent partnership
services, but I take to heart the point the noble Lord made about
ensuring earlier notification to parents of the availability of the
parent partnership service&#151;and I will see if there is more we
can do in that regard&#151;so that parents are aware of the
availability of the service from the point at which they need to start
engaging with the system regarding the special educational needs of
their children.</p><p><a name="06101925000588"></a>Amendments Nos.
115A and 116A were moved by my noble friend Lady Thornton and relate to
discrimination against disabled pupils. We accept the principles that
underlie them, but we believe that they are met by existing law and
guidance. In making their statement of principles and determining the
measures that constitute a school&#146;s behaviour policy, governing
bodies and head teachers must act in accordance with their statutory
responsibilities towards pupils with disabilities. In addition, Clause
87 makes it clear that a disciplinary penalty is a penalty imposed on a
pupil where his behaviour falls below a standard that could 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_964"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 964</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reasonably be expected of that individual; that is, behaviour that could
reasonably be expected of the pupil taking into account any disability
that he or she may have. Clause 88 specifies that, in order to be
lawful, a disciplinary penalty must satisfy three conditions, one of
which&#151;the condition of reasonableness&#151;is determined by
taking into account the pupil&#146;s
disability.</p><p><a name="06101925000589"></a>The same arguments apply to subsection
(1) of Amendment No. 117 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady
Buscombe. In determining a school&#146;s behaviour policy, head
teachers must act in accordance with their statutory responsibilities
toward pupils with special educational needs. The safeguards in Clauses
87 and 88 apply to special educational needs in the same way as to
disability.</p><p><a name="06101925000590"></a>We will be
reinforcing these messages and providing practical advice on how to
provide for such pupils in our guidance on school behaviour policies.
In doing so, we will consult with the Special Educational Consortium
and other key stakeholders about its contents.</p><p><a name="06101925000591"></a>Subsections (2) and (3) in Amendment No.
117 concern physical restraint. I stress that Clause 90, which deals
with the use of force, is not new. It re-enacts provisions that became
law eight years ago, and we are not aware of any problems caused by
them since. That is not to say that there have not been cases where
pupils, parents and school staff have been unhappy about when and how
physical restraint has been used. Given the emotive nature of the
issue, there are bound to be such cases. The actual guidance and law
have not been felt to be inadequate.</p><p><a name="06101925000592"></a>The department has supported the
provision with guidance, including specific guidance relating to pupils
with special educational needs. We will be reviewing our guidance in
the light of the parliamentary debates and will consult a wide range of
stakeholders as we do so.</p><p><a name="06101925000593"></a>I
turn to Amendment No. 117A regarding exclusions in the name of my noble
friend Lady Thornton, which was spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady
Darcy. This amendment would ensure that no disabled pupil or pupil with
special educational needs could be excluded permanently unless a review
was held, either of the reasonable adjustments being made for a
disabled pupil or of the special educational provision being made for a
pupil with special educational
needs.</p><p><a name="06101925000594"></a>My noble friend asked me
about the robustness of our protections for such pupils. I entirely
agree that we need protections which are as robust as we can make them,
balancing of course the duties that schools also have for the welfare
of other pupils. The recently issued guidance on exclusions from
schools with pupil referral units, which the department has given out,
could not be more robust in this respect. Paragraph 45 on pupils with
special educational needs
states:</p><ul><a name="06101925000884"></a>&#147;Statutory
guidance on identifying, assessing and making provision for pupils with
SEN, including those with behavioural, social and emotional needs, is
given in the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice. Schools must
have regard to this guidance. School governing
bodies&#148;&#151;</ul>

friend&#151;<ul><a name="06101925000924"></a>&#147;have
a statutory duty to do their best to ensure that the necessary
provision is made for any pupil who has SEN. Early identification and
intervention, accurate assessment and the arrangement of appropriate
provision to meet pupils&#146; SEN usually leads to better
outcomes&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000752"></a>On
exclusions paragraph 46 of the guidance
states:<ul><a name="06101925000885"></a>&#147;Other than in
the most exceptional circumstances, schools should avoid excluding
pupils with statements. They should also make every effort to avoid
excluding pupils who are being supported at <I>School Action</I> or
<I>School Action Plus</I> under the Special Educational Needs Code of
Practice, including those at <I>School Action Plus</I> who are being
assessed for a
statement&#148;.</ul><a name="06101925000753"></a>I believe
that the guidance on this issue being given to schools could not be
clearer. More progress needs to be made on the actual practice in
schools itself but that is improving.
<p><a name="06101925000595"></a>The statistics on the exclusion of pupils
with special educational needs shows a substantial drop. The number of
permanent exclusions of pupils with statements of SEN dropped from
2,250 in 1997 to 1,130 in 2002. It is now down to 850 for the last year
for which we have statistics, which is 2004-05. I think that the House
will accept that a reduction from 2,250 to 850 represents great
progress by schools, although of course there is further to
go.</p><p><a name="06101925000596"></a>A recent in-depth study by
the National Foundation for Educational Research into an admissions and
exclusions of pupils with special educational needs published in
January last year&#151;I will make this research more widely
available to noble
Lords&#151;concluded:</p><ul><a name="06101925000886"></a>&#147;Pupils
with SEN generally went through the same processes as, and were treated
similarly to, other pupils, but thresholds were often higher and a
greater degree of unacceptable behaviour was tolerated before the
exclusion process was
initiated&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101925000597"></a>That
indicates that the reasonable adjustments that my noble friend rightly
seeks and which schools are expected to observe under the Disability
Discrimination Act are already being observed by the great majority of
schools, as the research stated. However, we accept that more progress
needs to be made. That is why, under the Disability Discrimination Act,
from this December all schools will have to publish disability equality
plans, which will take the implementation of their obligations to a new
level.</p><p><a name="06101925000598"></a>I therefore hope that my
noble friend will be satisfied that we are very much on the case. She
asked me a number of specific questions, which I think were put to her
by the Special Education Consortium. I have long replies to each of the
points that she raised; it may be best if I circulate those to noble
Lords in writing. I hope that that will persuade my noble friend to
decide that she does not need to bring the matter back at Third
Reading.</p><p><a name="06101925000599"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew168"></a><a name="06101925001829"></a>Baroness

to the knacker&#146;s yard, anyway. I am pleased to say that the
human noble Lord, Lord Adonis, managed to negotiate the first, second
and third fences. Sadly, he fell at the fourth. Perhaps I should
explain what I mean by that. The first fence was Amendment No. 82B and
I thank the Minister for being so clear that SENCOs will not only be
teachers but part of the leadership scheme of the school and will have
a proper programme of continuous professional development. That will
move us even further in the right
direction.</p><p><a name="06101925000603"></a>The second fence was
Amendment No. 81, and I welcome what the Minister told us: that Ofsted
has been asked to do a thematic review of the training journey that
those teachers will have to take. I look forward to seeing that report.
On Amendment No. 82, on the duty to secure a range of provision, I
thank the Minister for clarifying the situation and telling us where we
find the information. I just hope that local authorities will be
influenced by looking at the range of provision of some of the best
local authorities and tailor their practice towards
that.</p><p><a name="06101925000604"></a>On the fourth fence, we
are at Report. Because of that, unfortunately, the noble Lord, Lord
Dearing, cannot reply for himself to the Minister's comments on his
amendment, so I hope that he will forgive me for having the temerity to
say one or two things about it. The Minister said that the Government
cannot accept a blank cheque, but what he did not say is that the
Government do not mind passing that blank cheque to local authorities,
with liabilities of up to &#163;150,000 a year per pupil. The
Minister said that he fears that local authorities might make perverse
decisions to place children in more expensive provision because they
might get some of the money back from the Government.</p><p><a name="06101925000605"></a>I think that that is extremely
far-fetched and ignores the fact that the very carefully worded
subsection (3) of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing,
makes quite clear that the costs would be shared. Should the local
authority place the child in more expensive provision, it would be
paying more. The Minister's objections to the proposal of the noble
Lord, Lord Dearing, do not hold any water. Having said that, the glass
was three-quarters&#146; full today, so far as I am concerned. I am
happy with what the Minister has had to say about my amendments, and I
beg leave to withdraw the

speak also to Amendments Nos. 84 and
85.</p><p><a name="06101925000611"></a>All the
amendments relate to Part 4, which is about local-authority
intervention in schools that are causing concern. The Minister will
have noticed that we on these Benches have been very reticent, in
contrast to our deliberations in Committee, about tabling amendments on
academies, city technology colleges and so forth. This is not because
he has convinced us that handling everything via the funding agreement
for the academies is satisfactory; on the contrary, we remain sceptical
about whether exempting this category of school from much of the
legislation that applies to other maintained schools is a satisfactory
way of proceeding, especially as the number of academies grows. This is
particularly so when wide-ranging duties are imposed on local education
authorities or local authorities. Yet the ability of the local
authority to deliver is limited because many of the key schools in the
authority&#146;s area are academies or city technology colleges and
will in future be trust schools and outside its control. In Southwark,
for example, all secondary schools will shortly be academies. Children
may well attend these schools, which are not maintained by the local
authorities, but the council is still responsible for their well-being
and educational fulfilment. Indeed, the schools are assessed in their
APAs on how well they perform, whether or not the council is
responsible for them.</p><p><a name="06101925000612"></a>The
amendments seek to change that situation, and to give local authorities
the power to intervene in all schools that are not performing
adequately. Councils should have powers to intervene and to assist
schools where there is poor delivery against the wider <I>Every Child
Matters</I> outcomes outlined in the Children Act, not only against the
failure to improve educational attainment. While many academies bed
down in the system and increase in number, they will not be immune from
failure. The Government should give the councils the powers to
intervene to ensure that academies are provided with support if they
are failing or coasting, so that the children&#146;s well-being and
educational potential are promoted. This is the situation for trust
schools, and we feel that this should also be the case for academies
and city technology colleges. This would strengthen the duty on schools
to have regard to the local children and young people&#146;s plans,
and would ensure that the key role of schools in delivering the
improved well-being for children under the <I>Every Child Matters</I>
agenda is adhered to.</p><p><a name="06101925000613"></a>These are
important amendments. There is a real dichotomy between the emphasis
being placed on local councils to have responsibility for the overall
performance of schools and to deliver the general objectives cited at
the beginning of the Bill. Some councils will have very little control
over the schools that will be delivering those outcomes. I beg to
move.</p><h5><a name="06101925000955"></a>5.30

Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords, I too strongly
emphasise the importance of this apparently very minor amendment. It
would bring city technology colleges and academies within the broad
scope of local-authority responsibility and, in a sense, the Secretary
of State&#146;s responsibility. Clauses 15 to 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_968"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 968</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>17 and 56 to 70 are all about possible failures and the need for special
measures, or about the need for improvement in the case of maintained
schools. In Clause 56, maintained schools are defined very precisely as
community schools, voluntary schools, voluntary and community special
schools and nursery schools. It is clear that the group of schools
addressed by my noble friend is excluded. She referred to the
responsibility of local authorities for the well-being of children,
which is an extremely important point.</p><p><a name="06101925000615"></a>I shall not repeat what she said, but I
wish to make a different point about the morale of community schools,
which is where most children still go and, I suspect, will still go in
five or 10 years&#146; time. Let us consider for a moment the way in
which the Bill presents itself: it has a considerable expectation of
failure in community schools. It makes almost no mention of academies
and CTCs. We are told that they will be dealt with in funding
agreements. But, as my noble friend has said, it is not at all clear
how funding agreements will operate in the quite condign and powerful
way that local authorities and the Secretary of State are empowered to
do. Consider how far reaching those powers are; for example, the
ability to name extra governors and which governor should be the
chairman; the ability to compel devolved budgets to be dropped; and the
ability, in certain cases, to close a school. There is a whole range of
weapons or powers which would affect schools that are thought to need
improvement or to be, effectively, failing
schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000616"></a>The former Secretary of
State, the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, said on the first
day of Report that a &#147;generosity of spirit&#148; was needed to
recognise the remarkable achievements of many community schools.
Somehow, the Bill exudes the sense that community schools are lesser,
require more intervention, are more likely to fail and have not done a
particularly good job. In responding, the Minister
said:</p><ul><a name="06101925000888"></a>&#147;I am not prepared
to stand here and defend failure&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 17/10/06; col.
674.]</ul><a name="06101925000754"></a>Of course, in saying
that he was right. But the assumption is that the schools associated
with academies and CTCs are unlikely to fail and that there are no
special provisions to deal with them if they do.
<p><a name="06101925000617"></a>I find that assumption very hard to
justify. Earlier, I mentioned to the Minister that in the United States
charter schools, in many ways, closely resemble trust schools and, even
more, academies. They are self-governing, independent schools in which
local school districts may not interfere; they have delegated powers
over their own budgets and are allowed to bring in sponsors; and they
have a range of the characteristics which are associated in this Bill
with trust schools and have previously been associated with academies.
Yet the latest information is that charter schools in the United States
are doing less well than ordinary state schools, by a substantial
margin in reading and mathematics. I will not go into detail on this,
but I hope that at Third Reading we will discuss this in more
detail.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_969"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 969</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101925000618"></a>I am concerned about the demoralisation of
those schools which are the great bulk of schools in this country. I
believe that the Bill exudes a certain sense of discrimination between
the two, which comes out most clearly in Part 4. I, for one, profoundly
regret it. On the first day on Report, the noble Baroness, Lady Morris
of Yardley, specifically said&#151;I do not know whether the Minister
would agree&#151;that there has been a remarkable improvement in
standards in schools in the past few years. She referred, of course, to
community schools which are still the bulk of schools in the
system.</p><p><a name="06101925000619"></a>To be precise, will the
Minister tell us in greater detail exactly what steps will be taken if
a school, which is described as an academy or a city technology
college, is found to be failing, or found, on a lesser criterion, to
require improvement? How will the Minister discover that need? What
will be the role of the Secretary of State in altering or changing the
funding agreement in order to bring about changes that might be
required? What steps would be taken to close a school that was failing?
In the United States, after five years a charter school can be closed
and replaced; there is nothing in this Bill of that kind. Finally, can
he explain why these very condign measures all apply to community and
voluntary schools, but do not appear to include the schools to which my
noble friend
referred?</p><p><a name="06101925000620"></a>I
would make a final point. Those who visit schools&#151;I know that
the Minister visits many of them as do my colleagues on the Liberal
Democrat Front Bench&#151;will be aware that many teachers and head
teachers in community schools feel somehow under attack. They feel they
have to defend themselves because there have been so many indications
that somehow they are not doing well. A minority of schools are not
doing well; we all have to admit that. But that is the case in all
categories of school. Even&#151;dare I say it in this sacred
Chamber?&#151;independent schools have a tail of failing schools. The
great thing to do would be to recognise that all schools can succeed or
fail, but we should not single out particular categories as being more
likely to fail or more likely to succeed. With great respect, the Bill
strongly gives that
impression.</p><p><a name="06101925000621"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew173"></a><a name="06101925001834"></a>Lord

Lucas:</b> My Lords, I should like to ask a brief
question on the government amendments. I was not aware that a
&#147;voluntary school&#148; was an established term of art in
England. I know the terms &#147;voluntary controlled&#148; and
&#147;voluntary aided&#148;, but the word &#147;voluntary&#148;
as shorthand for both is something I have not come across
before.</p><p><a name="06101925000624"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew175"></a><a name="06101925001836"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, it is shorthand for both; I
could have referred to voluntary aided and voluntary controlled
schools. I do mean both types of school and those are what the
amendments capture.</p><p><a name="06101925000625"></a>Amendments
Nos. 83, 84 and 85 were spoken to by the noble Baronesses, Lady
Williams and Lady Sharp. They relate to non-maintained schools,
particularly academies. They asked me in the first place how they will
be accountable for failure, and in the second place how they will make
a proper contribution to pupil well-being and the <I>Every Child
Matters</I> outcomes. In terms of failure, I think there is a
straightforward misunderstanding here. The powers held by the Secretary
of State in respect of academies track very closely the statutory
intervention powers which local authorities have over maintained
schools, including the enhanced powers set out in the Bill. The
Secretary of State has a range of intervention powers in respect of
academies which he holds by virtue of an academy trust&#146;s
articles of association and funding agreements. The Secretary of State
is enabled by these means to appoint additional governors, to stop
funding the academy or to close it outright. These powers are in every
respect as extensive as those a local authority is able to exercise
under the regime set out in the Bill. As I say, they track closely the
regime we are seeking to put in place in relation to maintained
schools.</p><p><a name="06101925000626"></a>I accept entirely what
the noble Baroness has said. She is right to say that no category of
school is immune to failure. We see that failure can afflict schools in
any category and I accept that that includes academies. Indeed, because
academies are succeeding some of the most challenging schools in the
country, they face particular challenges and are liable to fail. I have
never in any way disguised that fact. But I believe that our <I>bona
fides</I> in this respect can be seen to be quite clear. For example,
the Unity City Academy in Middlesbrough was put into a category of
failure by Ofsted. My department took immediate action of a kind which
we would expect a local authority to take when exercising its powers
under this Bill. We engaged in a dialogue with the sponsor that led to
very swift and radical changes to the governing body of the academy
very quickly after the inspection report and made within a timescale
which we would expect local authorities to observe. There 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_971"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 971</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was also a substantial change to the leadership of that school, a
decision taken by the reconstituted governing body in close
consultation with the departments. I am glad to say that this year the
results of that academy rose significantly in both the key stage 3 and
GCSE
categories.</p><p><a name="06101925000627"></a>I
do not seek to suggest that there are different rules or different
regimes. There is a great difference in the relationship between the
state and academies&#151;and, indeed, other categories of more
autonomous schools&#151;and the relationship between local school
boards and charter schools in the United States. I accept that they
have a much greater degree of autonomy. In some cases&#151;because
each individual state in the US has different chartering
arrangements&#151;it is very difficult for a state to intervene short
of pulling the rug out and withdrawing funding to make it impossible
for the school to proceed. In our system, the full accountability
regime applies to all categories of schools. We discussed earlier the
school improvement partners, which are appointed in respect of
academies and other categories of school, and their accountability for
results, the publication of performance data and inspection by
Ofsted.</p><p><a name="06101925000628"></a>As
regards pupil well-being and <I>Every Child Matters</I>, we have
mechanisms in place to uphold schools&#146; accountability for
contributing to <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes, irrespective of
the category of the school. We have the new Ofsted inspection regime,
school self-evaluation and the role of school improvement partners, all
of which apply equally to non-maintained as well as to maintained
schools. In respect specifically of academies, they are obliged to
contribute to the five <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes in a variety
of ways. First, through their funding agreements, which make them
responsible for being at the heart of their community, sharing
facilities with other schools and the wider community. Secondly, it is
an expectation that each academy will work closely with its local
authority to ensure that the needs of each child are met and that the
directors of children&#146;s services are able to carry out the
duties and accountabilities placed on them for every child educated
within their local area, regardless of whether the child attends a
state or independent school. Thirdly, academies will be required to
participate in their local children and young people&#146;s plans and
to have regard to them. My right honourable friend the Secretary of
State gave an undertaking in another place that we would amend the
articles of association and funding agreements of academies to ensure
that they are obliged to have regard to children and young
people&#146;s plans. We have already indicated to the academies that
we intend to make those changes in their funding
agreements.</p><p><a name="06101925000629"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew176"></a><a name="06101925001837"></a>Lord

interesting speech and I am grateful to him for allowing me to ask a

be established under the Education Act 1996, as amended by later

agreements set out the range of interventions I have indicated and the
requirements in respect of children and young people&#146;s plans
that I have also set
out.</p><p><a name="06101925000631"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew178"></a><a name="06101925001839"></a>Baroness

the Minister for his reply. There remains, however, a real problem. For
all that is in their funding agreements&#151;academies and city
technology colleges are required to contribute to the <I>Every Child
Matters </I>outcomes, to adhere to the local children and young
people&#146;s plans and to work with the local authority to make sure
that the needs of every child are met&#151;nevertheless those are, to
some extent, voluntary matters and depend upon the good will of the
academy in contributing to them. However, the local authority is
assessed under its annual performance assessment for <I>Every Child
Matters</I> on the performance of the schools in its area. There is a
disjuncture between what is expected at a national aggregate level in
terms of aggregate measurement of how the local authority is performing
and the instruments that that local authority are given to make sure
that its performance measures up to what is expected.</p><p><a name="06101925000632"></a>I accept that the
Secretary of State intervenes, and intervenes in the same way. He was
prompt in intervening at the Unity City Academy in Middlesbrough when
Ofsted reported badly on it. We have no assurance other than his word
that the Secretary of State will act with the same promptness in
future. There may be occasions when there is a delay and, as a result,
the local authority fails to meet what is expected of it under the
<I>Every Child Matters </I>agenda.</p><p><a name="06101925000633"></a>There is a logic in what we are asking

to apologise for forgetting to thank the Minister for the government
amendments in that last group which resulted from points that we made
in Committee. We are most grateful to the Government for
that.</p><p><a name="06101925000645"></a>I should like to say a
word about Amendments Nos. 93 and 94, in the name of the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe. It is perhaps unfortunate that my amendment
comes first; we are all very grateful to the noble Baroness for raising
the important question of the role of modern foreign languages in
today&#146;s school curriculum. It might have been more desirable if
she could have spoken first, but that&#146;s the way the cookie
crumbles in your Lordships'
House.</p><p><a name="06101925000646"></a>Like the noble Baroness,
Lady Greenfield, who recently set up a new all-party group on
scientific research in education and learning to which I am very much
looking forward, I believe we should base our education policies on
high quality evidence of how children learn best. Not only that, we
need to take into account when they learn best. With languages, there
is a mountain of evidence that they learn best at an early age. My
grandchildren learnt Chinese as they were learning to talk, at the same
time that they learnt English. It was amazing to me to hear them
chattering away to each other in Chinese as they played. If we want to
do something about the terrible reputation we British have for
languages, we need to start early. That is what Amendment No. 91 would
achieve.</p><p><a name="06101925000647"></a>I am aware that the
Government have introduced a number of initiatives in primary schools;
no doubt the Minister will tell us about some of them when he responds.
I am also aware that there is a lot of good practice out there and many
schools have been very creative in the way in which they have addressed
the matter. One multicultural school I heard about has a language of
the week, when a few children get to share their mother tongue with the
rest of the school, including the teachers, for at least a few days in
the year&#151;and there are even more languages in that school than
there are weeks in the year. That sort of thing helps children to get
the idea that there is more than one way in which to express
things.</p><p><a name="06101925000648"></a>Only the other day, one
of my husband&#146;s little grandchildren looked at the television
and said, 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_974"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 974</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;Mummy, there&#146;s a <I>mochyn</I>&#148;. His mother, who
speaks only English, was a bit puzzled until she realised that in Wales
they teach Welsh to three year-olds, and Finlay was referring to the
pig on the television&#151;which in Welsh, I gather, is a
<I>mochyn</I>.</p><p><a name="06101925000649"></a>I know that there
might be an objection to my amendment relating to the availability of
the appropriate work force to carry out what I am seeking to
do&#151;to ensure that all children have some experience of a modern
foreign language from the very first key stage. I would encourage the
Government to take steps to train qualified teachers to specialise in
teaching languages to very young children. But in the mean time I see
no reason why teaching materials cannot be developed by qualified
people for use by ordinary primary
teachers.</p><p><a name="06101925000650"></a>I say
&#147;ordinary&#148;, but I think that most primary teachers are
extraordinary in the way in which they manage to get their heads around
so many subjects and make them interesting and exciting for the
children. They already wear a lot of hats, so one more may not be such
an imposition, especially if they are working with good quality
materials. Besides, I think that most teachers realise that as they are
preparing children to grow up in quite a different world from the one
in which I grew up, when air travel and mass emigration has made the
world a much smaller place, it is essential that we get them learning
languages at the best possible moment&#151;that is, early. In
addition, I would like to see schools using native speakers of other
languages from the community and bringing them into primary schools.
The foreign teaching assistants who work in secondary schools might
also be able to contribute something. We need to be a bit imaginative
and a bit flexible&#151;and I hope that the NUT will agree with
me.</p><p><a name="06101925000651"></a>On the amendments tabled by
the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, I am afraid that despite the fact
that I am grateful to her for raising the subject I do not support her
Amendment No. 93, which would make a modern foreign language compulsory
at key stage 4. With the first public examinations, you need to give
young people as much choice as possible and not be too prescriptive,
apart from the core subjects. But the noble Baroness has kindly
listened to an objection that I made when we first considered this
matter&#151;that for some children it would be better to spend the
time on more English lessons. That is what her Amendment No. 94 seeks
to address in part. But the provision applies to two groups: the first
is those for whom English is not their mother tongue, which is the
group she addresses in Amendment No. 94. The other group is of those
children for whom, although English is their mother tongue, they have
some difficulty with it and need extra help. The Government have
rightly identified that literacy is the most basic tool and opens the
door to all sorts of other learning so is the right and proper focus of
many initiatives, but the noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment No. 94 does
not take those children into account. For them, it would not be
appropriate to enforce a course of study of a foreign language up to
public examination stage.</p>

on to your Lordships a lovely phrase that I heard only this morning
from my noble friend Lord Roberts of Llandudno. He told me that when he
was in Jerusalem recently a young Arab boy said to him, &#147;When I
have one language it opens one window on the world; when I have two
languages, it opens two windows on the world&#148;. I leave your
Lordships with that thought and I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101925000653"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew182"></a><a name="06101925001843"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> My Lords, Amendments Nos. 93
and 94 carry on our crusade for the reintroduction of modern foreign
languages as compulsory subjects up to the age of 16. That compulsion
was the case until 2003, when modern foreign languages were demoted
from foundation subject status to entitlement subjects. The amendments
would allow those children for whom English is a second language to
spend time studying English that they would otherwise spend on another
modern foreign language. We believe that will complement the fantastic
efforts of schools that teach a large proportion of children for whom
English is not their first
language.</p><p><a name="06101925000654"></a>Since the demotion of
modern foreign languages in the curriculum, there has been a dramatic
drop in the number of people studying a modern foreign language at
GCSE. Indeed, by November 2005, 64 per cent of maintained schools had
experienced a fall in the numbers studying modern foreign languages for
key stage 4, compared with figures for the previous three years. John
Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College
Leaders, stated in the <I>Times</I> on 25 August this year that the
entries for foreign languages are in &#147;free
fall&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101925000655"></a>I
have highlighted this situation before. I remind your Lordships&#146;
House that a survey last February by the European Commission found that
two in three adults in Britain could not speak a language other than
English. That has severe ramifications for our place in a competitive
global market. It is not just a matter of trade-offs, as the Minister
described in his response in Committee; rather, this is a serious
component of the future of our successful competitiveness in a global
economy.</p><p><a name="06101925000656"></a>There
is a serious failing in the way in which policy on the curriculum has
been managed under this Government. The Government&#146;s policy has
been described by the general secretary of the National Union of
Teachers, Steve Sinnott, as a &#147;complete disaster&#148;. I
hasten to add that I do not believe that that is the fault of the
Minister, or necessarily the way in which this present department has
dealt with the issue. In fact, I sincerely believe that, were it
convenient to undo the policy decision from 2003, he would do so. That
would be welcomed by the professional and teaching sectors, and it
would enhance our integration in a global and European economy. Indeed,
that is the decision that I hope to encourage him to consider
today.</p><p><a name="06101925000657"></a>It is
widely recognised that offering only optional languages up to 16 has
taken its toll on the success of our education system as a whole. The
director of the National Centre for Languages, Isabella Moore,
states:</p><ul><a name="06101925000897"></a>&#147;With 70 per
cent of businesses now involved in some form of international activity,
the idea that languages are just for &#145;academic&#146; pupils is
short-sighted and damaging to the economy&#148;.</ul>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_976"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 976</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06101925000755"></a>You only have to go into the City of
London to see that most of the employees now are foreign. The reason is
that they come to this country able to speak different foreign
languages competently&#151;not just one, but maybe two and often
three&#151;and to do business in them.
<p><a name="06101925000658"></a>Isabella Moore&#146;s
statement is striking. I was reminded of it as I read the Financial
Services Skills Council&#146;s report,<I> Graduate Skills and
Recruitment in the City</I>, of September this year. The paragraph on
skills and abilities makes it clear that foreign graduates have a huge
advantage over English graduates in the City. Those graduates are a
direct product of globalised labour markets which have undergone
periods of change in recent years&#151;namely, countries in eastern
and central Europe with developed education systems. The report noted
that, as I just said, many of the graduates who apply to international
firms speak several European languages, including their first language
and English, and that the potential further expansion of the EU will
increase the flow of highly skilled migrants from East to
West.</p><p><a name="06101925000659"></a>Let me be clear. I am not
suggesting that we do not welcome the great benefits that people from
other countries bring to our economy. Those economic migrants make an
invaluable contribution to our economy. But I believe that we should be
giving our children the skills that will lead to their having the same
opportunities to compete in that market. That is the least that we can
provide.</p><p><a name="06101925000660"></a>I heard the noble
Lord, Lord Dearing, talking on Radio 4 at the weekend about the need to
make learning a foreign language interesting, attractive and important.
With great respect, I worry that we fear requiring children to
undertake challenges in their school life unless those challenges are
somehow sugar-coated. One only has to consider for a moment the growth
in competition for jobs from highly skilled, low-cost economies such as
China and India, where children are learning foreign languages and are
hungry to compete with our children in the UK, to appreciate just how
important languages are.</p><h5><a name="06101925000957"></a>6
pm</h5><p><a name="06101925000661"></a>In short, our children cannot
be aspirant if they do not speak at least one modern foreign language.
That is how important this is. Therefore, I am pleased that the noble
Lord, Lord Dearing, is to carry out a language review and that the
Secretary of State has noted the amendments that we tabled in Committee
and has recognised that this is an urgent
matter.</p><p><a name="06101925000662"></a>I have reread the
Minister&#146;s response in Committee, where he made it clear
that,</p><ul><a name="06101925000898"></a>&#147;Part of our
problem in focusing high-quality language teaching in our schools is
deciding which language should be taught&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 20/7/06; col.
1513.]</ul><a name="06101925000756"></a>That is why I have
revised my amendments so that the choice of languages would remain a
matter for the discretion of the Secretary of State. I believe that
that is right, as it allows time for consultation on the most
appropriate languages to learn and flexibility to adapt languages
learnt in a changing world.<p><a name="06101925000663"></a>I
congratulate the Minister on the initiatives that he has introduced. A
positive drive towards training

welcome.</p><p><a name="06101925000664"></a>I
was intrigued to hear about the Spanish language dance mat that the
noble Baroness, Lady Howe, has been sent. I hope that before this Bill
goes to another place other noble Lords will have an opportunity to
test it out.</p><p><a name="06101925000665"></a>I say to the noble
Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp, that while the principle of
their amendment is laudable, I fear that the cost implications in the
immediate future are too great. However, it is a worthy aim, which I
hope the Minister can factor into consideration of the future of
primary education. The comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley,
about the workforce were absolutely right. I well recall that my
introduction to learning French was entirely audiovisual. It was not
necessary for the teacher to have a qualification in that foreign
language under his or her belt. I learnt just from listening to a tape
and watching a screen. It was fantastic. I can still repeat much of
what I learnt many years ago. To say that the measure is unworkable
because there are not enough teachers exacerbates the downward spiral.
I shall repeat that comment when we discuss science education next
Tuesday. We cannot afford to lose any more time. This matter is
critical.</p><p><a name="06101925000666"></a>I have said much about
the need to teach foreign languages to meet young people&#146;s
aspirations in the global economy. This is not just about securing jobs
in the City; there is huge competition for all jobs. The flexibility
that so many foreign students have to take on new subjects because they
can converse in a different language is amazing. We are denying our
children huge opportunities and chances in life because of the frankly
dreadful policy that is in
place.</p><p><a name="06101925000667"></a>These
amendments are tabled in spirit with amendments on the three sciences
and the IGCSE that we shall discuss next week. They are all presented
with a joint purpose&#151;to raise standards in our schools and to
give our children the global opportunities that they deserve. I hope
that the Minister will give a positive response to our amendments and a
stronger policy commitment to modern languages than we have seen from
his department so
far.</p><p><a name="06101925000668"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew183"></a><a name="06101925001844"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I very much support
these amendments. My children went to the French <I>lyc&#233;e</I>
aged four and mopped up French like sponges. That is the age when
children begin to learn language. Although initially I was delighted
that the maintained system would by 2010 offer children aged 10, for
the first time, the chance to choose a foreign language, nevertheless I
could not help reflecting that in most independent schools there was no
question of having an option. You were taught a foreign language. You
may not have enjoyed it much but you jolly well got used to it. Now we
are in this disastrous situation, which seems to have got worse since
2003, as we heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe. That is
clearly due to the fact that foundation status was removed at that
stage.</p>

secondary stage there are so few pupils now taking the subject
voluntarily. We are also seeing very few going on to read foreign
languages at university, so we have a growing spiral of horror. I urge
the Government to think in terms of recruiting more people. One or two
suggestions have been made&#151;for example, recruiting people who
are perhaps over here doing other jobs and who have foreign languages.
Even within our own community, there are people who have considerable
skills in modern foreign languages. We should be recruiting them to
help us&#151;as a temporary measure, if you like&#151;to get over
this problem and to reinstate foreign languages.</p><p><a name="06101925000670"></a>I commend the Minister for the interest
that he has clearly taken in this issue, not just because I have as a
result had the dance mat sent to me. There has also been a lot of
activity in terms of helping the individual. I commend the BBC&#146;s
attempts in the interactive programme &#147;jam&#148;, which
children and those with special needs can take particular advantage of.
It is also open to teachers to interact in the same sort of way. You
have the same situation as the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, was
talking about, where you could learn from a screen updated with the
internet. As far as I am concerned, the earlier this is done, the
better, and you should make it attractive in whatever way you like. You
could have daily a language of the week. As has been pointed out, we
have all these different languages, and everyone could speak their own
and show the different words that are used in their mother tongues. I
urge the Government to please do anything that they can on this issue
and to treat it as a matter of
urgency.</p><p><a name="06101925000671"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew184"></a><a name="06101925001845"></a>Baroness
Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords, I shall use a
foreign language to say, &#147;<I>Plus ça change, plus
c&#146;est la même chose</I>&#148;. I cannot forget that
years ago when I was Secretary of State for Education we endeavoured to
bring in French to schools for children at the age of eight, with the
suggestion that there should be a second foreign language at the age of
12 when children had gone into the upper school. We started a special
language teachers&#146; college, and we tried to encourage people to
go in and to learn other languages. There was a big upsurge, as the
noble Lord, Lord Dearing, will find out, in the study particularly of
Russian at that time, followed quite closely by Spanish. There was
quite a widespread fashion in schools to learn Russian because of the
significance of Russia in the 1970s and 1980s, and Spanish became a
more popular subject. I do not quite know why so much of that
initiative has withered on the vine. It may have been partly the
outcome of financial reductions proportionately in educational
spending.</p><p><a name="06101925000672"></a>I completely agree
with the noble Baronesses, Lady Buscombe and Lady Howe, that this is a
disaster. A country such as ours, if it expects to go on being
successful, even in the most direct economic terms, cannot expect to be
taken terribly seriously, or to get contracts, or to win service
contracts in particular if it is completely unable to speak any
language but its own. It is not very easy to conduct diplomacy entirely
in one&#146;s own language; it makes one very unpopular 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_979"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 979</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with foreign powers. But it is much more than that; it is about a kind
of narrowing of the whole sense of the world&#146;s culture and it is
an inability to know any of the literature of other countries in a
world that is becoming increasingly interdependent. It means that
Britain in many ways is impoverished by the simple incapacity to speak
anyone else&#146;s language. It is not only about language, but about
thinking in the way that other people
think.</p><p><a name="06101925000673"></a>I remember years ago,
when I was teaching in Africa, hearing one French African say to
another, &#147;<I>Voila l&#146;esprit Cart&#233;sien</I>&#148;.
That was is the middle of a desert in Senegal. I could not help
thinking that there was something quite staggering about French culture
when all those miles away from metropolitan France people can talk
about <I>l&#146;esprit Cart&#233;sien</I>. That tells you something
about other cultures, other languages and other countries and the
contribution that they can make to the world&#146;s
civilisation.</p><p><a name="06101925000674"></a>So I strongly
support the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, in her amendments, and I am
certain that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, will listen very carefully
because I am sure that his heart is already with the
debate.</p><p><a name="06101925000675"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew185"></a><a name="06101925001846"></a>Lord
Lucas:</b> My Lords, one trouble with the French is
that they cannot admit that Descartes was wrong. I entirely support the
spirit of my noble friend&#146;s amendment. It seems enormously
important that we should get ourselves to a position where we find
foreign languages easy, as many other European nations do. The learning
of languages is clearly not inherent to us in a genetic sense; it is
something that we have allowed to develop as a cultural
artefact.</p><p><a name="06101925000676"></a>Having been top dogs
for a long time, we do not realise that we cannot now &#147;boss it
around&#148; in the way that we used to. Although we have the great
privilege of English being the international business language, it will
clearly be under threat from Chinese. The Chinese are determined to
make their language the business language of the East and they are
putting a lot of money into that. I am delighted that we are responding
through the British Council to keep English in there.</p><p><a name="06101925000677"></a>One way and another, we are going to find
ourselves in a world where we need to speak foreign languages and, in
any case, doing so is a matter of courtesy. If you are dealing
seriously with people from another country, it is clear that you, one
of your colleagues or someone in the business must understand them,
their culture and their language. This should be, as it is in so many
other European countries, something that we generate
ourselves.</p><p><a name="06101925000678"></a>As
the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said, language learning has to start at
the earliest stages, when it is easy. I have the habit of buying DVDs
on eBay and, from time to time, I end up with some fairly strange
products. So, when I have not quite read what it is I am buying, my
daughter watches &#147;Shrek&#148; in Cantonese and various other
things in French and Mandarin. But she absorbs and enjoys them, and one
picks up the occasional foreign word in her conversation&#151;it
seems to be a natural facility at that age.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_980"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 980</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101925000679"></a>As my noble friend Lady Buscombe said,
there are many good products out there at the moment. There are
self-education courses aimed at almost every level. It does not require
teachers to know the language; they can learn it along with the pupils.
Indeed, having an inexperienced teacher helps you to learn to use the
product and to get over problems. We could set out on a journey
together in Russian, my teacher and I, and I do not need her to start
with a word of it. So long as she understands how the process works, we
can follow the same course together and help each other to get over the
hurdles. That can happen at any age.</p><p><a name="06101925000680"></a>We do not need a great cohort of people
speaking whatever language in primary schools. What are we going to
dictate to primary schools that they should do? We need only give them
the facilities and the encouragement so that they can pick up on a lot
of material that is out there and explore languages with their pupils.
They can give those pupils a facility and make it seem easy to them.
They can make it seem that languages are not the enormous hurdle that
they have come to be seen to be&#151;the hard discipline or the GCSE
that is hardest to get through. Languages should trip easily off the
tongue.</p><p><a name="06101925000681"></a>I am absolutely
delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, has been given the job
that he has. It means that we have two people to speak to this evening:
the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and the Minister&#151;and I hope that
we can convince at least one of them.</p><p><a name="06101925000682"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will take an
interest in the music examination system, which, it seems to me, has
always had a great deal of application in languages. It should be taken
in small steps. The split between playing and theory also seems to fit
very well with languages. You can have just the speaking&#151;the
enjoyment&#151;of the language to a certain level and allow the
theory to lag behind but then catch up later. That is certainly how
people get caught into the system of music exams. They may well reach
grade 5 without knowing much theory but then realise that they have to
catch up. But, by that stage, they are already on the ladder
and&#151;whoosh&#151;the theory comes on from behind. On the other
hand, the two peg together so that, by the time you are getting
anywhere serious, you are level-pegging on theory and on the enjoyment
side.</p><p><a name="06101925000683"></a>There is a lot of hope if
only we can realise what it out there, how easy it is to learn
languages and how much can be done without enormous expenditure or
training and without a great deal of dislocation. One thing we must do
is ensure that we motivate schools to teach languages. At the moment
one can drop languages, take up media studies or whatever and there is
no difference at all; there are the same results and the same
motivation. We have to make it clear that languages are to be valued
and that they must be reported on separately so that schools can focus
on them. Let them use their ingenuity and the facilities with which we
provide them to decide how, with their pupils, they will make progress
in languages.</p><p><a name="06101925000684"></a>There is a great
deal of expertise and understanding out there about how to teach
pupils. Let it go. Let us not have the problem we had a few

&#147;business studies in Spanish&#148; was pioneered by Millais
School, a state comprehensive in Horsham. It was killed by the QCA,
which said, &#147;We&#146;re not having this; it is far too
expensive; it is not standard; we will charge you &#163;50,000 a year
to ensure it is up to standard&#148;, and so it died. That is
entirely the wrong attitude. We have to let lots of people try lots of
different ways of motivating pupils who come from a background where
there is no incentive to learn languages. We want them to pick up
languages and enjoy them. Given that kind of spirit, we will get
somewhere.</p><h5><a name="06101925000958"></a>6.15

Quirk:</b> My Lords, I also urge my noble friend Lord
Dearing on his way. I wish him the best of luck and I congratulate the
Government on having the idea. The great irony is that in this country
we have the reputation of being monolingual. In fact, we are the most
multilingual country in western Europe. We ignore that at our peril.
Most of the languages that are spoken are either unfashionable or
dangerous. Being monolingual, when we talk of speaking a foreign
language in this country, we think only of the Anglo-Saxons in our
midst. They are the people who are
monolingual.</p><p><a name="06101925000686"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Lucas, rightly mentioned the problem we have in motivating people.
The fact that English is misleadingly referred to as a world language
helps to disincentivise our young. I hope that when my noble friend
Lord Dearing gets down to business, he will not look upon GCE or even
the old CSE as the appropriate models for foreign language learning,
but will look more towards the model for music testing. Under the music
criteria, a child learns a little at grade one on violin or piano and
acquires a sense of achievement when he gets there. At grade five there
is a link across to music GCSE. I think we shall have great difficulty
in teaching British children French, German and Spanish unless we can
find new ways of motivating and encouraging them to learn those
languages.</p><p><a name="06101925000687"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew187"></a><a name="06101925001848"></a>Lord
Dearing:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may reflect for a
moment. In 1993, I was withdrawn from the world of higher education,
where I was devising a new funding methodology, to do a lightning
review of the national curriculum. By comparison, university was a
kindergarten. I had never been so terrified in my life as during the
three months I was given to review the national curriculum because
there was such passion and conviction, but it was all over the place.

shut up. I will say things, however, from time to time, because it
draws fire, excites interest and I learn.
<p><a name="06101925000689"></a>A couple of things. First, I had a letter
from a head teacher in a special school which said some good and
sensible things, but she felt that this review was not really for
special schools. I e-mailed her to say, &#147;Yes, the review
concerns all schools&#148;. Secondly, several references have been
made to the ladder. Without having studied it, I see it as something
that must command my attention, partly because of the small steps and
the motivation and recognition that come from it and partly because,
between steps, there are smaller steps recessed within the school
rather than externally&#151;the individual rungs are external. It
could be a means of getting that articulation between
primary&#151;where everybody is saying we should start&#151;and
secondary without the dislocation that so often happens. I say that
with some anxiety but, since it has been urged upon me, I shall look
into it.</p><p><a name="06101925000690"></a>I am vastly intrigued
by the dance mat. I have received in the post &#147;Flirt
Spanish&#148;, and wonder if we could trade. I have not yet assessed
it for its relevance and value.</p><p><a name="06101925000691"></a>I feel privileged as well as terrified to
undertake this review, and do so with the recognition of how important
it is to make progress in this area. I recall the German ambassador
once saying something like, &#147;If you come to my country to buy
something, speaking English, OK. But if you come to sell something, it
helps to speak a bit of German&#148;. I think we all gain from
speaking a bit of German.</p><p><a name="06101925000692"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew188"></a><a name="06101925001849"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, anyone who has followed
education policy over the past 15 years, under both parties, will know
that whenever a particularly intractable problem presents itself, one
not subject to the powers of mere mortals to overcome, the noble Lord,
Lord Dearing, is sent for. By an inscrutable process which usually
takes several months&#151;he acts very fast&#151;he produces a
<I>deus ex machina</I>: the answer to all our problems and an effective
way forward. If he was able to do it with student finance&#151;about
the most intractable issue it is possible to imagine&#151;he may find
languages a relatively easy problem to crack.
</p><p><a name="06101925000693"></a>On behalf of the whole House, I
say how grateful we are to the noble Lord for taking on this
responsibility. In my experience, there is no challenge that he does
not rise to splendidly. The country owes him many debts of gratitude
for the public services he has performed over the years, and this will
be not the least of them.</p><p><a name="06101925000694"></a>A
heavy burden rests on him, because there is a great sense of public
unease&#151;I shall be frank&#151;reflected in the debate this
evening about the teaching of languages in secondary schools. The noble
Baroness is quite right to highlight the issue in her amendment. We
have grappled with it and have not found the last word on policy in any
respect, and have passed the baton to the noble Lord to find a better
way forward for us.</p><p><a name="06101925000695"></a>Under the
terms of reference, which my right honourable friend has agreed with
the noble Lord, he will examine the scope for action to further

languages after 14. He will look at how we can support secondary
schools in making a wider range of more flexible language courses
available, with accreditation so that more young people keep up
language learning&#151;if not all the way through to GSCE, certainly
to the later years of secondary education. He will work with
representatives of further and higher education to see what might be
done to widen access to, and increase interest in, language learning
among students. He will also consult employer organisations, other
organisations and pupils to see what ideas they have for taking forward
policy in this area.</p><p><a name="06101925000696"></a>The noble
Lords, Lord Quirk and Lord Lucas, mentioned the languages ladder. It
closely reflects music grades and was designed with the philosophy of
music grades in mind. Students can demonstrate their competence in
languages in small stages and progress without having to make the giant
leap to GCSE that was previously required. I am delighted to say that I
am about to present the 10,000th award under the languages ladder
scheme, and that must be a sign that it has reasonably wide take-up,
which is a welcome development. I am delighted that the noble Lords
highlighted the languages ladder for examination of how its wider use
in schools could be encouraged to ensure that teaching and learning
languages do not suffer the rapid fall-off that they currently
experience in secondary years.</p><p><a name="06101925000697"></a>In respect of Amendment No. 91, which was
tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, I am glad to say that the
position in primary education is rather better. When we introduced the
new policy on languages, which included making them optional at key
stage 4, our philosophy was that we needed to do much more to make a
reality of what the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, was seeking to do
back in the 1970s; namely, the systematic introduction of languages in
primary schools. In order to carry through that policy, we not only
established a new national entitlement that will take effect in due
course, but we also provided significant support for languages teaching
in primary schools, including a new PGCE for languages in primary
schools&#151;formerly, there was no dedicated PGCE for teaching
languages in primary schools&#151;and providing financial support to
allow schools to introduce languages. Since that policy began in 2002,
more than 2,000 primary teachers with a languages specialism have been
trained, and in the financial year 2006-07 and until the end of this
decade, a further 1,000 primary school languages teachers will be
trained 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_984"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column 984</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>each year. By the end of the next financial year, we will have invested
more than &#163;60 million to build capacity at primary
level.</p><p><a name="06101925000698"></a>There is evidence that
this is having an effect. In December 2002, only one in five primary
schools was offering language learning opportunities, most of that was
extracurricular and there were no trained primary teachers specialising
in languages. Now, according to the latest survey, 56 per cent of
primary schools are delivering or planning to deliver languages
learning programmes, so significant improvement has taken place in
primary schools. However, I accept that there is a great deal further
to go. We need to look not only at training additional languages
teachers for primary schools, but also at how languages can play a role
in the development of extended schools at primary level and at how we
can further encourage supplementary schools, which can have a
significant languages component, which we are also seeking to do. We
also need to look at how we can further embed the languages ladder so
that primary school pupils not only start to learn a language, but take
the stages of the ladder seriously to improve their competence year on
year. If we can crack that, we will have made a substantial
contribution to ensuring that pupils in secondary education are
motivated to learn languages. In languages, as in all other subjects,
motivation is the key. If students arrive at secondary school motivated
to learn languages by already having made progress and possessing steps
on the languages ladder, then half our job will have been
achieved.</p><p><a name="06101925000699"></a><b><a name="61019-0004.htm_spnew189"></a><a name="06101925001850"></a>Baroness

freefall. I share her concern. We differ on what to do about it. We
feel that if we started teaching modern foreign languages earlier more
young people would want to take them up to external exam level and go
on to university; so we would not need to compel them.</p><p><a name="06101925000700"></a>The old saying is &#147;If it

which has been overseen by an independent panel of experts and veterans
representatives, consisted of three main studies. The first examined
the interaction of certain vaccines in mice and reported last year on
21 July 2005 (<I>Official Report</I>, House of Commons, 117
WS).</p><p><a name="06101923000021"></a>The
second, and main, study has been undertaken at Defence Science and
Technology Laboratories (Dstl) Porton Down and involved
monitoring marmosets for up to 18 months following the administration
of vaccines and/or pyridostigmine bromide (the active ingredient in
nerve agent pre-treatment tablets). Partial results from the
study, covering cognition, muscle function, general health and sleep,
were announced on 20 July 2006 (<I>Official Report</I>, House
of Commons, 37 WS). Papers reporting the remaining final
results on the immunological aspects of the study have now
been published online in the journal <I>International
Immunopharmacology</I> and can be found at
www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/15675769. The papers report that
the immune system had not been compromised by any of the treatments and
that there was no evidence of adverse health effects due to the
administration of vaccines and/or pyridostigmine bromide. The study
findings have been independently endorsed. Donald Davies, Emeritus
Professor in Toxicology at the Imperial College, London, who chaired
the independent group which oversaw the study, has commented that the
study was well designed and conducted. Together with the expert
immunologists from the panel, he supports the conclusion that the
animals suffered no adverse health effect, despite exposure to
exaggerated doses of
vaccines.</p><p><a name="06101923000022"></a>The final study
examined whether staff from Dstl Porton Down who received multiple
vaccinations during their employment have higher levels of sick leave
than their unvaccinated colleagues. The findings, which are being made
available today on the MoD website, show that staff at Porton Down who
had received multiple vaccinations suffered no excess sick
absence.</p><p><a name="06101923000023"></a>The overwhelming
evidence from the programme is that the combination of vaccines and
tablets that were offered to UK forces at the time of the 1990-91 Gulf
conflict would not have had adverse health effects. This has been a key
area of concern among Gulf veterans and the results of the research
should be reassuring to those veterans who have been concerned about
the safety of the medical countermeasures that they were given. I hope,
too, that it will reinforce confidence in the countermeasures that are
offered today and in the
future.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61019-wms0001.htmstate_3"></a><a name="06101923000005"></a>Ministry

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Tom Harris) has
made the following Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06101923000030"></a>I am announcing today
that a new, simple zonal fares structure will be introduced for train
travel within London from January 2007. The <I>Future of Rail</I> White
Paper, published in 2004, announced our intent to work with the Mayor
on rationalising fares and ticketing technology within the Greater
London Authority (GLA) boundary. At the moment, there are several
thousand individually priced station-to-station rail fares within
London. The system is complex and a barrier to introducing smartcard
technology to train services within the
capital.</p><p><a name="06101923000031"></a>We have changed the
franchise agreements of those train operators setting fares within
London, to require them to replace the many different individually
priced fares with a simple set of London-wide zonal fares. The new
fares will be based on the same familiar zones already used for

be required to set peak single, peak return and off-peak return fares
for journeys wholly within London on a zonal basis from January 2007.
Operators will be required to set rail-only seasons on a similar zonal
basis from January 2010.</p><p><a name="06101923000032"></a>The
prices for the new zonal peak singles and returns&#151;and from 2010,
seasons&#151;will remain subject to the limits set by fares
regulation. As a result, London commuters will on average pay no more
using the new zonal fares than they would have done had current fares
continued and been increased as permitted by regulation. Operators will
not make a net gain from the change in these
fares.</p><p><a name="06101923000033"></a>The new fares mean that
the same fares will apply in all parts of London. Passengers who have
been paying fares below the London-wide average may find the new fares
higher, whereas those currently paying higher-than-average fares are
likely to find the new fares lower. Prices are being published today on
the DfT website, and will be placed in the Libraries of the
House.</p><p><a name="06101923000034"></a>This
simplification of London rail fares paves the way for Oyster
pay-as-you-go smart ticketing to be rolled out across national rail in
London over the next few years. As interoperable smartcards based on
the Department for Transport-sponsored ITSO (Integrated Transport
Smartcard Organisation) standard are rolled out outside London,
passengers will be able to benefit from national through-ticketing on
all modes of travel to deliver truly seamless
journeys.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61019-wms0001.htmstate_6"></a><a name="06101923000008"></a>Railways:

Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Tom Harris) has
made the following Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06101923000036"></a>The
Department for Transport has today published the north-west regional
planning assessment for the railway (RPA), the fourth in a series of
eleven RPAs covering England and Wales. The north-west RPA covers the
whole of the north-west
region.</p><p><a name="06101923000037"></a>RPAs are the key link
between regional spatial planning (including preparation of regional
transport strategies) and planning for the railway by both Government
and the rail industry and are designed to inform the development of the
Government's strategy for the railway. They look at the challenges and
options for development of the railway in each region over the next 20
years, in the wider context of forecast change in population, the
economy and travel behaviour. An RPA does not commit the Government to
specific proposals. Instead, it sets out the Government&#146;s
current thinking on how the railway might best be developed to allow
wider planning objectives for a region to be met and identifies the
priorities for further development
work.</p><p><a name="06101923000038"></a>The north-west region has
a population of just over 6.8 million , 11 per cent of the UK total,
and the highest population density of any region outside London. While
population levels are not expected to grow significantly, the number in
employment is

journeys is forecast for the region and it is expected that there will
be particular growth in longer distance journeys, particularly to
London and the south-east. Within the region, the highest increases are
expected to be in journeys to and from the metropolitan
areas.</p><p><a name="06101923000039"></a>Planning for railways in
the north-west needs to take into account a changing economic and
social context set out in the regional spatial strategy and regional
economic strategy. Rail has a part to play in addressing
national and regional government agencies&#146; aims and delivering
the objectives of initiatives such as the Northern Way, which have
influenced the formulation of the north-west
RPA.</p><p><a name="06101923000040"></a>The RPA clarifies the role
of the railway in the region, its contribution to the economy and its
place in the overall transport system, setting out where greater rail
capability and capacity will be needed over the next 20 years, and the
options for responding to that need. The focus of the RPA is making
better use of the existing network but it also draws attention to the
need to improve access to stations, including interchanges, and the
expected need to increase train capacity to meet forecasted growth in
demand.</p><p><a name="06101923000041"></a>Copies of the document

Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the
Minister of State for Transport (Dr Ladyman) has made the following
Ministerial Statement.</p><p><a name="06101923000043"></a>The QEII
Bridge at Dartford was built under a concession agreement whereby it
would return to public ownership after the construction costs were paid
for through tolls at the crossing. This happened in March 2003. The
Government decided at that time to implement a regulatory charge at the
crossing at broadly the same levels as the tolls, using powers in the
Transport Act 2000. The reason for this was to manage the high demand
for use of the crossings.</p><p><a name="06101923000044"></a>The
department has been reviewing the charging regime in the light of
current traffic levels, likely future demand and broader transport
policy considerations. Given the forecast growth in traffic,
maintaining a charge for the use of the crossing is the only credible
way of keeping traffic at manageable levels in the medium term.
However, we have concluded that the case for imposing a charge at night
when traffic is much lighter is outweighed by the 



<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS92"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column WS92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>



<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS92"></a><b>19 Oct 2006 : Column WS92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>potential gains from encouraging traffic to avoid
peak times. The department therefore intends to drop the charge for all
vehicles using the crossing between the hours of 22.00 and 06.00. The
department believes that this will be an incentive, for lorries in
particular, to make journeys outside busy periods where this is an
option. Our analysis indicates that if daytime charges are left at the
current levels then traffic will continue to grow, leading to worsening
congestion. Cars have been paying a &#163;1 rate for 10
years.</p><p><a name="06101923000045"></a>The case for increasing
charges has been clear for some time. One reason why increases for cars
have not previously been proposed is because of concerns that multiple
coin transactions are likely to cause delays at the booths. For some
years it has been possible to pay tolls electronically, using microwave
&#147;tags&#148;. Such systems are common on the Continent and in
the USA. Dartford, and some other tolled roads and crossings in the UK,
already offer the option of paying via a tag. This means of payment
saves costs for operators and allows drivers a smoother passage through
the charging booths.</p><p><a name="06101923000046"></a>The
Government also wish to mitigate the impact of charge increases on
those who depend on regular use of the crossing for work or business.
The Government therefore propose that charges for car drivers paying
cash should increase to &#163;1.50. Under these proposals, drivers
who choose to use a dart tag would pay a significantly discounted rate
of &#163;1, which is the current cash charge. With more people using
the dart tag, traffic flow through the charging booths will be
smoother, and regular users such as commuters will experience little
financial impact.</p><p><a name="06101923000047"></a>The
implementation of the new charges will be made using a charging order
under the Transport Act 2000 and the Government will, as is required,
consult on this. We expect to launch that consultation by December 2006
with a view to having the order in place by October 2007 and the new
regime coming into effect by January
2008.</p><p><a name="06101923000048"></a>In the longer term, we
expect demand for use of the crossing to continue to grow. Various
options for new capacity across the Thames have been considered in the
past, but the Government believe the issue now needs to be moved
forward, particularly in the light of development plans for the Thames
Gateway. The department will therefore be commissioning a study to look
at the options for addressing traffic issues in the longer term,
including the possibility of a new crossing. Work will start
immediately on specifying the scope of the study with a view to letting
the study as early as possible in
2007.</p>

Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos):</b>
The humanitarian situation in the Palestinian Territories remains
difficult, particularly in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians in Gaza receive
only six to eight hours of electricity and two to three hours of water
every day. Israeli Defence Force (IDF) incursions and air strikes
continue. Palestinian homemade rockets are still being fired into
Israel. Gaza's border crossings with Israel and Egypt have been mainly
closed since late June, except for imports of basic supplies. DfID is
keeping close track of the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and
Gaza through the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian
Affairs (UN OCHA).</p><p><a name="06101927000023"></a>With
technical assistance from DfID, UN OCHA is producing a monthly
<I>Humanitarian Monitor</I> report. According to the most recent
report, poverty in Gaza now stands at 79 per cent, marginally up from
77 per cent a year ago. However, among families that depend on salaries
or payments from the Palestinian Authority (PA) poverty has risen from
42 per cent to 49 per cent in the past year. Average food prices in
August were 9.95 per cent higher than in July. Hospitals and health
centres in Gaza continue to function, although at reduced capacity.
Fourteen per cent of essential drugs are out of stock. More
than 80 Palestinian homes and structures were destroyed, 61
Palestinians killed and 146 injured in Israeli military activity during
August. Internal violence among Palestinians caused 12 additional
deaths and 55 injuries. Homemade Palestinian rockets injured
10 Israelis. The monthly <I>Humanitarian Monitor</I> is available at

specific programmes to provide, first, essential medicines and health
supplies; secondly, operations, maintenance and repair costs for water,
sanitation and electricity services; and, thirdly, income for the
poorest Palestinian Government workers, including teachers, who have
suffered a severe loss in income over recent months. DfID has also
provided &#163;15 million to support Palestinian refugees in Gaza and
the wider region, though the United Nations Relief and Works

for gifted and talented students both in their own and partner
schools.</p>
