That includes any decisions of the European Court of Human Rights where these are assessed as appropriate to the measures under consideration. We do not believe that this approach inhibits the introduction in the United Kingdom of counterterrorism measures.</p>

In the wake of a critical alert and of the evidence up the road at the Old Bailey, should not the following steps be taken to avoid the inhibition: to reclaim the surrender of sovereignty under the European Convention on Human Rights; to enable Parliament to enact and enforce counterterrorist legislation and safeguard sensitive intelligence, and so to that end amend the Human Rights Act; and to seek derogation under the convention? The need for those measures could never have been envisaged in 1953 on ratification, in 1999 on enactment of the Human Rights Act or before 9/11, which transformed the world.</p>

This Government have a proud record of undertaking to do that. I am not aware that human rights legislation has inhibited us in carrying out that sacred duty because it is an important balance to strike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="07071035000039"></a>The Army&#146;s Diversity Thread programme seeks to increase the number of ethnic minority soldiers recruited into all parts of the Army by engaging with key influencers and the target audience. This involves raising awareness of the Army and its place in society and building interest in the Army, its careers, values and standards, all with the intention of potentially securing a commitment to join or simply to support the ideals of the service.</p>

I chair the Conservative Muslim Forum and the Ethnic Diversity Council. I speak at meetings and seminars encouraging the ethnic minorities to join the police and Armed Forces. My Question was prompted by the fact that, when I attended the Trooping the Colour ceremony, out of some 1,400 officers and soldiers I saw no more than 10 persons from the ethnic minorities. There is something not quite right here. Will the Minister assure your Lordships' House that everything is done to combat racism in any form&#151;I emphasise &#147;any&#148;&#151;in the Household Division, and that if there is a perception of racism, adequate awareness of the Army and its values are raised through enhanced public relations?</p>

It is very important that we continue all the efforts in the tri-services, not only in the Army, to increase the number of ethnic minority young men and women who want to be part of our armed services.</p>

<a name="70710-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="07071035000042"></a>Recruitment to our armed services from our ethnic minority communities has increased year on year for each of the past seven years. However, we start, as the noble Lord indicated, from a very low base. For instance, in 1998-99 only 1.7 per cent of enlisted service people were from an ethnic minority. In 2006-07 that has gone up to 3.9 per cent. Our target for 2013 is 8 per cent, the percentage of the population from ethnic minorities as measured in the 2001 census. We will continue all the recruitment initiatives and training going on in the Army and other services to get to that target.</p>

The Minister will be aware of the National Audit Office figures on recruitment and retention for November 2006, which, as she said, showed an increase in recruitment from the ethnic minorities; but there are also some worrying factors. First, while we have increased the number recruited to some ranks from 1 per cent to some 6.2 per cent in 2006, it has levelled off significantly in the past few years. Secondly, and more importantly, while there has been improved recruitment of ethnic minorities at other ranks, the figures for officers are far lower&#151;only a third of those for other ranks. Will the Minister comment on that and tell the House what the Government intend to do about it?</p>

The highest-ranking ethnic minority direct-entry officer is a brigadier. We know that it is a problem and we are on to it. What are we doing about recruiting? We are getting to young people directly by going into schools and youth clubs. We are sponsoring sports events and kit, and doing direct marketing of that kind.

Since that time, following implementation of the five-year action plan and its monitoring by the CRE, interest has levelled off. Is it not time that another action plan with independent monitoring was put in place to ensure that we hit the targets set for the armed services and the Household Division?</p>

The CRE has had a long relationship with the Army and the MoD, looking at the problems, starting 10 years ago, of bullying, perceptions of racist behaviour and so on. It recognised that it had to improve the situation in the armed services. The CRE has worked closely with the Army and the other services. The noble Lord has said in the past:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="07071035000259"></a>&#147;The Armed Forces have recognised that equality and diversity are positive strengths for an organisation and their work in this area is setting standards that other sections of society should follow&#148;.</p>
</ul>

It appeared quite clearly to me that there was some holding-back because it is felt that this Government, with a little help from the previous Government, have cut the military beyond the quick and that it is no longer a prime service. Ministers need to get around a bit more. Is the Minister aware that I have not heard many Members from the other place trying to persuade ethnic minorities in their constituencies to join the military or the police forces? I am a little suspicious of the Government&#146;s intentions in this area. Not nearly enough force and push is being put into recruitment.</p>

In particular, we are working with the Sikh community in Southall. Sikh Gurdwara staff are working very closely with the Wembley recruiting office. That is a small example of where we are talking directly to communities that traditionally have not looked to the services.</p>

They deal with perhaps the most distressing forms of cancer, which are so disfiguring and cause difficulty in eating. Seventy-two per cent of the 197 experts consulted in this field considered that it was very important to have a much greater stress on and funding of end-of-life care. Will she take that into consideration?</p>

It has undertaken to set up an independent working party under Sir David Walker to develop a voluntary comply-or-explain code so that its case can be better presented to the public. At present, only the adverse position has been identified and, as my noble friend indicated, that ought not to lead to immediate reaction from the Government, nor will it.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="07071035000260"></a> Clause 53, page 26, line 25, leave out subsection (3)</p>
</ul>
<a name="70710-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07071035000097"></a>The noble Baroness said: The business managers should provide the mover of the first amendment after Questions with some standard form of wording that would show all the proper courtesies but allow the House a moment to show how much noble Lords support the development of local government in England and Wales. I hope that is the right formula. Many years ago, when I brought the controller of a BBC radio channel into the Chamber, he looked at the microphones and said, &#147;It must be quite interesting mixing the sound in here&#148;. This is probably an example of that; the volume of my microphone seems to have been turned up.</p>

<a name="70710-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07071035000098"></a>The amendment is grouped with Amendments Nos. 89 and 90, in the name of my noble friend Lord Greaves. Clause 53 provides for elections for parish councillors to be held in years when there are also elections of district councillors in the same place. I can understand that there would be reasons for having the two sets of elections on the same day, such as cost, convenience and turnout, but there are also good reasons to separate them. Where the parish is the &#147;parish pump&#148; type, beloved of those who write certain types of fiction, and not political, one can understand that cost and convenience would outweigh other considerations.</p>

<a name="70710-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07071035000099"></a>However, not all parishes are small or apolitical. Where there is a lively local political scene, it would not necessarily be desirable to hold the two sets of elections at the same time. It is useful for voters, first, to be able to show that they understand that this is a different election and, secondly, to reflect shifts in the political mood as the years go by. The two elections can be a useful counterpoint to each other. I have tabled this amendment so that the Government can explain their thinking and to ask them to confirm that in this instance &#147;district&#148; includes a unitary authority. I beg to move.</p>

My noble friend raised a very important matter about parish councils which will underlie quite a lot of what we say on the next part of the Bill: the great variety and difference there is between the different bodies called parish councils or the larger ones called town councils. Some are large, with a large budget, and function like a town council; others are small, covering a village community or even a community with no obvious village, and operate very differently. They operate under the same law and the same rules, but, as my noble friend pointed out, they can differ greatly. Amendment No. 89 would simply insert the duty of a district council to consult parish councils before it took any action under this clause. It seems reasonable that, if your elections are to be moved from one year to another, you ought to be asked first what you think about it. That ties in with what my noble friend said about choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07071035000101"></a>Amendment No. 90 is very specific and would apply in very few circumstances. Nevertheless, I can envisage circumstances in which the year of an election, under the Government&#146;s proposals in this Bill, would be moved from one year to another and there would be a choice. For example, if a district council was moving back from whole-council elections to electing itself by halves every two years, the parish council election date would probably have to be moved under the Bill. There would be a choice of two years in which to do that. It seems reasonable that, under those circumstances, what the parish council thinks should prevail.</p>

I am very glad that we have been able to have this debate now. Before I turn to the amendments, let me confirm to the noble Baroness that &#147;district&#148; includes unitaries.</p>

<a name="70710-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07071035000103"></a>The Government are opposed to the amendments tabled against Clause 53 and 45. Current standard practice is that parish council elections are held in the same year as the elections to the district ward within which they are situated. This is to reduce the costs and administrative burdens on electoral administrators. Amendment No. 88 would allow the date to be set for a year different from that for the district ward elections, which would increase costs and administrative burdens. We are therefore opposed to this amendment.</p>

<a name="70710-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07071035000104"></a>On Amendment No. 89, we do not consider that central government needs to be prescriptive on the consultation procedure that the district council follows. I mentioned that approach earlier in Committee. The aim of devolution is to trust democratically accountable local authorities to act reasonably and to consult those parties which they consider to be interested. We do not believe that provision specifying these specific consultation steps needs to be made in the Bill. However, the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is perfectly reasonable. Making an amendment which would allow the parish council&#146;s view to prevail on this issue is not acceptable. We are devolving responsibility to local authorities. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden and costs for electoral administrators, and therefore the district council must decide. There would also be a considerable risk that a political group controlling a parish council might choose an election year that would suit its electoral prospects.</p>

<a name="70710-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07071035000105"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 90, we have retained the power in the Local Government Act 2000 so that if in the future, for example, the vast majority of councils in England operated whole-council elections, the Secretary of State would be able to move the remaining few councils to achieve a uniform pattern across England. The amendment would prevent the Secretary of State from doing that in the future under any circumstances. We are clear that the power to change electoral cycles should generally be devolved to local authorities. However, we believe it is important that the Secretary of State retains a power that in particular and, I stress, exceptional circumstances he or she may use in the future to change, by order, a council&#146;s electoral cycle to that of whole-council elections. I hope that the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07071035000117"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment does not need a great deal of discussion, but I thought that it was worth running through what appears to be a wish by central government to encourage more local authorities to move towards single-member, as opposed to multi-member, wards. This is certainly associated with a wish that local authorities that elect every year by thirds, or three years out of four by thirds, should move to whole-council elections every four years.</p>

<a name="70710-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07071035000118"></a>I am not sure that central government should be taking a view on whether single-member or multi-member wards are good or bad. It seems to me that that should basically be left to local discretion. However, a number of issues arise from it which come from tradition as much as anything else, and it is a tradition based on sensible things. Large county councils with large county divisions have traditionally had single-member electoral divisions. That has worked because they are large both in area and often in terms of the number of people in each ward and each division, and a single-member division is therefore sensible.</p>

The authorities ought to be asked to look at that, although the decisions should be basically local.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07071035000120"></a>In large or small urban authorities, multi-member wards are a good idea, whether the elections are by thirds or whole-county elections, because they provide people with a choice of councillors. Councillors are not infallible, although sometimes some of them think they are. Sometimes it is good to have a choice of who represents you in your ward. Sometimes that involves different parties, but even if it is the same party, some people may be very good while others are hopeless. People go through bad patches in their lives; they may be ill and unable to serve the people as well as they might have done previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07071035000121"></a>There ought not to be a presumption that single-member seats are better than multi-member seats, and the Government ought to pull back from what seems to be a current wish to move more authorities to become single-member wards.

Clause 55 allows county councils, along with all other councils, to make a request for single-member electoral areas. To require them to make such a request would force county councils that wish to retain two- or three-member divisions to do something they may not want. The Bill provides local choice, and we see no good reason to force county councils to make such a request. If they wish to do so, no doubt they will.</p>

<a name="70710-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07071035000123"></a>It is questionable whether the Electoral Commission and its Boundary Committee would have the resources to conduct reviews of the 21 county councils that do not have single members in all their divisions if those councils were forced to make these requests within six months.</p>

<a name="70710-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07071035000124"></a>The noble Lord indicated that he wished Clause 55 to be deleted, but it inserts new sections 14A and 14B to the Local Government Act 1992. Those new sections enable a principal council that is subject to a whole-council election to request the Electoral Commission to direct the Boundary Committee to conduct an electoral review and to recommend whether each electoral area in a council&#146;s area should return one councillor. The Electoral Commission is not obliged to grant the request, but if it decides not to do so, reasons must be given. Electoral areas in a county council are county divisions, and the areas in a district council are district wards, as I am sure noble Lords are well aware.</p>

<a name="70710-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07071035000125"></a>In conducting the review, the Boundary Committee will be required to have regard to the following matters, which it must already have regard to when carrying out electoral reviews: it must reflect community identity and interests, ensure effective and convenient local government, and secure equality of representation. If the Boundary Committee, having had regard to these needs, considers that it would be inappropriate to recommend that all electoral areas become single-member electoral areas, it is not obliged to make such a recommendation. The clause devolves to councils the initiative to seek single-member electoral areas where they consider it right to do so. The amendment would force councils to do something they do not wish to do. I hope that the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment. We recognise the importance of tradition,

If that review was undertaken, presumably the change in the wards would not come into force until the following election time. What impact might that have on the nature of representation? Presumably, the way that the ward boundaries are formed could affect the make-up of the local council.</p>

It is for the Electoral Commission to decide that. If such a review takes place, the Boundary Committee would need to take into account the criteria that I outlined.

If I have understood the Bill correctly, an issue of substance here needs to be looked at carefully. These provisions are, as I understand them, about boundary reviews in areas with elections either twice or three times every four years&#151;in other words, elections by halves or by thirds.</p>

<a name="70710-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07071035000141"></a>Many non-metropolitan districts&#151;districts in two-tier areas where there is a county council and district councils&#151;currently have a range of wards, from one member to three members. There are often quite a lot of three-member wards, but sometimes there are two-member wards and, particularly in rural areas, single-member wards. Some districts have predominantly single-member wards, such as Ribble Valley or Craven near the Pennines where I live, with a few multi-member wards in the towns. Other districts, such as Pendle or Burnley, have mainly three-member wards but may have, as Pendle does, some two-member and single-member wards.</p>

<a name="70710-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07071035000142"></a>If I have read the Bill correctly, authorities that elect in halves will have to have wards divisible by two and authorities that elect in thirds will have to have wards divisible by three. This would mean a substantial change in the existing pattern and would seem to me in these areas to be a mistake. The existing pattern of wards is deliberately there to reflect the geography of the place; there are towns where multi-member wards are appropriate and rural areas where they are much less appropriate, with a village or group of villages with just one councillor.</p>

<a name="70710-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07071035000143"></a>The purpose of Amendments Nos. 95 and 96 is to probe exactly what is proposed in the Bill and whether my reading of it is correct. Amendment No. 99 looks at the situation in metropolitan districts. If metropolitan districts are to be able to have wards of different sizes&#151;which is apparently proposed, although I am not sure how it fits in with what I have just been talking about&#151;this issue should be discussed. The proposal may be appropriate, particularly for any that move towards whole-council elections, although I do not think that there will be many. Taken together with the section that I have just been talking about, however, it appears that the choice is between three-member wards and six-member wards. In metropolitan districts, six-member wards would run the risk of being altogether too big. The amendments are a means of probing what these provisions mean with a view to determining later whether they are sensible or not. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70710-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07071035000145"></a>The Government oppose Amendments Nos. 95 and 96 because, where there are elections by halves, the wards should, where possible, have two councillors or a number of councillors divisible by two; where there are elections by thirds, the wards should, where possible, have three councillors or a number of councillors divisible by three. This is to provide equity of opportunity for electors at the ballot box.</p>

<a name="70710-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07071035000146"></a>In an area with elections by thirds, there will be elections in three out of four years in a full electoral cycle. If you have three-member wards in such an area, there will be elections in each ward in each of those three years and all electors will have a chance to vote at every election, giving them the opportunity to influence the composition of the council on each such occasion. However, if there are single-member and two-member wards, in those wards elections will be held in only one or two years of the full electoral cycle and voters in those wards would miss out on the opportunity to vote in years when voters in other wards would be voting. We believe that this should be avoided wherever possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07071035000147"></a>However, we have made having the appropriate number of councillors per ward desirable rather than mandatory. This is so that if the Boundary Committee believes that where, for example, there are elections by thirds, having three-member wards would not allow a particular community to be included wholly within that ward, thereby not reflecting the community identity criteria that I mentioned earlier, a different and more suitable number of members for that ward can be recommended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07071035000148"></a>In January 2004, the Electoral Commission stated that in principle it is fundamentally unfair and unacceptable that within an individual local authority some of the electorate should have fewer opportunities to vote and influence the political composition of the authority than their neighbours in a different ward. We are therefore providing within the Bill that, if there are not whole-council elections, the number of members per ward should reflect the electoral cycle unless for a particular ward the Boundary Committee believes that that cannot be achieved, notwithstanding the downsides that that would bring.</p>

<a name="70710-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07071035000149"></a>We do not believe that Amendment No. 99 is necessary. The Electoral Commission has stated that its current policy is to avoid wards with more than three councillors per ward as it believes that that dilutes accountability. There are currently no wards with more than three members in any principal council in England. Therefore, the intention of the amendment is already being met. However, we do not wish to reduce the options available to the Boundary Committee. In future, there could be peculiar circumstances somewhere in England where a four-member ward might best reflect the local community. Clause 48 removes the requirement in the Local Government Act 1972 that the number of councillors returned for a ward in a metropolitan district should be divisible by three. In future, the number of councillors

That will bring the arrangements for metropolitan district councils into line with those for shire district councils.</p>

<a name="70710-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07071035000150"></a>Clause 58 is the result of a request from the Electoral Commission, which conducted a year-long review of the electoral review process. Following the review, the commission requested that it be given greater flexibility in metropolitan areas, and this clause delivers that. The amendment would reduce that flexibility, which would inhibit the independent Electoral Commission and the Boundary Committee in their desire to produce the most suitable electoral arrangements for the different areas of England. I hope that I have helped the noble Lord by giving him further information and that he now feels able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I am pleased about one thing in it, which is that my reading of what the Bill proposes is correct. However, I am not pleased about being correct, because the Government are fundamentally wrong. With the words &#147;where possible&#148; and so on, the noble Baroness makes it sound as if there will be a few exceptions here and there, but not very many, and that, where there are exceptions, the wards will be bigger to accommodate communities rather than smaller. I am not happy about that. It is a substantial, fundamental change for a number&#151;I do not know how many, but I will find out&#151;of shire district authorities that elect by thirds at the moment and have wards ranging from one to three members. Those authorities will find a significant change in their arrangements when we next have a boundary review. The arrangements that exist at the moment are there for good reasons, and usually accommodate the reasonable needs of rural areas. People do not feel cheated because they do not vote as often as other places, but if you ask them to weigh up the relative benefits of having their own councillor for a group of villages or having three councillors as part of a much larger rural ward, many like the arrangements as they are.</p>

There may be circumstances where it is appropriate to have bigger wards in rural areas, but in many places people deliberately go for small two-member or single-member wards in those parts of a district where that is appropriate. I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that my reading of the Bill was correct. For the moment I beg leave to withdraw this amendment, but some of us might like to have further discussions about this and come back to it on Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07071035000174"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment takes us to the clause dealing with the change of name of an electoral area. It would require the local authority to give at least two months&#146; notice of a proposal to change the name. I was prompted to pursue the matter because of my experience at London borough level. The ward that I represented for 20 years disappeared as a result of ward boundary changes, and so did its name. I was quite startled by the number of times local people asked me what had happened to the ward that was under that name.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07071035000175"></a>The name is important&#151;it is an identifier&#151;and people can be quite strongly wedded to it because it expresses at a political level the place that they feel is theirs.

A number of Members of Parliament referred to the importance of names in a political context. There are several issues involved. The members of the committee were particularly concerned about the question of marginality, which, as they are Members of Parliament, I suppose they would be. A mixed composition ward might include a huge council estate and great deal of quite prosperous middle-class housing, and whether you name it after the council estate or after the prosperous housing makes a difference to the impression that people have of where that ward naturally lies in traditional political allegiances.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07071035000177"></a>That is the clear message that came across from the discussion in the House of Commons committee. We know that it is true. If you name the ward after the council estate, it sounds as though it might be a Labour ward; if you name it after the posh area, it sounds as though it might be a Tory ward. The truth is, of course, that it might be a safe Liberal Democrat ward. But perception is important. In marginal wards, whether people think it is worth bothering to go out and vote is a crucial matter in local elections and can make a real difference to the result.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07071035000178"></a>Amendment Nos. 100 and 101 run together. A change of name is an important decision and should require a two-thirds majority of the council. The Minister may say that we are being overprescriptive again and that we should leave this to local authorities. However, I come back to the point that I made on the first day of Committee that, for obvious reasons, electoral matters are different in kind from a great many of the other things that local authorities do. Decisions made about electoral matters can influence and determine the results of elections and the people making the electoral decisions may have a vested interest in them. I am not saying that they should not make such decisions, but they should have to think about them.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07071035000179"></a>First, my noble friend and I are suggesting that there should be a statutory publicity requirement so that authorities cannot sneak through decisions. Secondly, I am suggesting that it should be more difficult to pass changes to ward names than to make decisions on most of the other things that local authorities do. This is a part of the electoral process and the impositions on local authorities ought to be greater than they are.</p>

The Bill as it is constructed says that a meeting must take place in order for those names to be confirmed, but it does not actually say a meeting of what. Presumably it is either a meeting of the council, in which case the council can make the decisions, or a local meeting that can be attended by people who live in the ward.

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07071035000182"></a>A name that identifies an area is either posh or otherwise in the minds of the electorate, and they will not take kindly to suddenly discovering that the place where they reside is named differently. As I understand it, the council that has the power to do that would be ill advised to do so and cause a furore, because the political consequences could well be quickly visited upon it and its political complexion. The Minister can help the Committee by explaining the advantage of the amendments to the present situation. At present the council is allowed, in the light of empirical evidence, to decide that there is a need for a change and to propose and effect that change, but only by taking along with it the people who are affected. Although the Minister and others have used the term &#147;far too prescriptive&#148;&#151;that is, there are too many tiny details&#151;there are some people who want everything in tiny detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07071035000183"></a>As an ex-councillor, I think councils ought to be given some credit for their political sense in appreciating that changes, which from the town clerk&#146;s point of view may seem to be administratively sensible, need to be looked at in the light of the effect upon ordinary people. I do not have a view on the value of the amendments. I agree with what has been said. The present Local Government Act under which we are operating gives ample provision for the local council to make its decisions, with safeguards. People who control councils are not politically stupid. They know the consequences of what they are doing. If they behave unreasonably&#151;or politically, with a large &#147;P&#148;&#151;they deserve all they get.</p>

It allows a local authority to change the name of any of its electoral areas&#151;district wards or county divisions&#151;by resolution of the authority at a special meeting. That is our interpretation of the clause. Where the name of an electoral area is protected, a resolution  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1299"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cannot be passed until the Electoral Commission has agreed to the change. The name of an electoral area is deemed to be protected if it has been specified under the Acts in subsection (6)(a) within the past five years. Particular circumstances protect some areas.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07071035000186"></a>The current position is that the name of an electoral area can be changed only by the Electoral Commission following a full electoral review, which takes about 12 months. We are making that change following an evaluation of the periodic electoral review process. The Electoral Commission requested the change. It considers that given that the council can change the name of the district, the parishes and parish wards within the district, it should also be able to change the name of the district wards. This is part of devolving power and flexibility to local authorities. Local authorities should be able to change the names of their electoral areas as they see fit unless they are protected, as I said.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07071035000187"></a>On the point made by the noble Baroness Lady Hamwee, the Local Government Act 1972 already makes provision for the procedural requirements for meetings of local authorities so the question of notice is already covered. It includes requirements about notice and voting. We do not think that it is necessary to supplement the existing provision in this Bill with regard to that issue.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07071035000188"></a>As I said, I agree with the Committee that names are important and the issue can be emotive. We accept that, but we are trying not to be too specific or prescriptive, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, suggested I might say. The aim is one of devolution; to trust local authorities to act reasonably and consult those parties who are interested. We will discuss Clause 139 tomorrow, but in this provision we are trying to devolve decisions to local authorities. We do not consider that a two-thirds majority should be required for a name change in an electoral area. It is unlikely that a name change would be of interest to all members of the council and it would be too great a restriction on an authority to require a two-thirds majority.</p>

The exception is Amendment No. 101A, which heads the group, to which I shall return.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07071035000197"></a>All the amendments reflect the view that it might be a good idea to have the two elections on the same day but that some notice needs to be given so that everybody knows what is going on, not least the candidates, the political parties, the electoral registration officers and the returning officers. There is a dispute over whether the period should be six months, which I understand the Government will propose in their amendments, or one year, as the Electoral Commission proposed&#151;which in different ways some of my amendments suggest, as well as the amendments of my noble friend. We will have the interesting discussion over whether it should be six months or one year, but there is a general view that the period should be in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07071035000198"></a>Amendment No. 101A is slightly more ambitious. It would be over-egging it to say that it was a probing amendment, but it floats an idea in the hope that that might generate a discussion outside the confines of this House.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07071035000199"></a>Three years ago the local elections took place on the same day as the European elections. It was a glorious May and June, and the experience of taking part in those local elections in that fine weather, with light evenings right up to nine o&#146;clock at night and not having to go out canvassing or delivering leaflets in the depths of February, March or April on dark nights, was really delightful. From the point of view of encouraging participation in elections, it would be sensible if we thought about moving the ordinary election day to June. It might also increase turnout. That was certainly the experience in June 2004. Turnout was up in those elections and there were various reasons for it. There were four all-postal pilots, which detained your Lordships' House for some time before it agreed to them. They certainly increased the turnout a little in those areas where they took place. However, the turnout went up in other places as well.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07071035000200"></a>A comparison of the different regions, and of Scotland and Wales, and the different circumstances in those areas suggested that the increase in turnout was down to three things. Some of it was down to the all-postal pilots&#151;perhaps about 5 per cent. Some of it was down to having the European elections and the local elections on the same day, so that those people who cared about local elections also went to vote in the European elections and those people who cared more

That appeared to account for another 5 per cent. However, even in areas where neither of those things applied and where an ordinary election took place at the polling stations, the turnout was up by about 5 per cent.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07071035000201"></a>There was a clear indication of an underlying increase in turnout at those elections. I do not think that anybody has worked out exactly why it was, but I firmly believe that it was because the elections were in June. A lot more campaigning was taking place because of the better weather and better circumstances, and a lot more voters turned out. The Government are keen on increasing the turnout and think of all kinds of strange gimmicks which most of us think are pretty hopeless and do not work, or are dangerous, such as all-postal voting. However, moving the local elections four or five weeks into the summer would do that. It would not have an unfortunate effect on the running of local authorities. Local authorities managed perfectly well in 2004, with an annual meeting a month later, and I am sure they would do so again.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07071035000202"></a>I float the amendment as an idea rather than as a serious matter that I expect the Government to agree to immediately today. However, it is a move that we and the local government community, as it calls itself nowadays, should think about generally. I beg to move the amendment, to allow debate on the group.</p>

It is interesting that there is a proposal in the Bill that we should muck about with election dates. We have had a great many debates in this Chamber as elections have moved for various reasons. I well recall the moving at short notice of the date of the general election due to the foot and mouth crisis.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07071035000204"></a>If we are to accept that dates will from time to time be changed, we have to accept also limits within which those dates can be moved unless a national emergency arises. National emergencies do not normally arise where local government elections are concerned. If the European elections are to be taken as the base on to which local elections could or could not be moved, we need a long lead-in. A year is probably a little over the top&#151;I am sure we can debate the virtues of whether it should be a year or six months ad nauseam. However, there must be time, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, for returning officers to be able to prepare, for them to get two lots of ballot papers ready for the counting to be arranged, and for all the administrative tasks that have to be done for elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07071035000205"></a>However, I hope that this will not become the normal course of events. I accept that if one has a couple of elections thrown together at the same time, more people may turn out to vote in them, but there is a danger of people of becoming election-weary and just turning up because it is any old election and saying, &#147;It doesn&#146;t really matter whether it is the European election or it&#146;s the local elections because they are all there together and, well, we might or we might not go&#148;. We still want to encourage people to

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07071035000206"></a>This is a permissive clause that allows the Secretary of State&#151;under an order if necessary or required&#151;to consider moving the date. I hope that it remains permissive only and does not become a regular event. However, if it has to be used, I will propose that at least six months&#146; notice is given.</p>

My amendment seeks to alter the proposed six-month period to one year.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07071035000208"></a>I want to make it clear that I am only discussing the proposed power to coincide the date of local and European elections. It is not about a wider power to move the date of local elections. I have some sympathy with the sentiments just expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. As a former county councillor, I fought two county council elections on the same date as general elections. There is no doubt issues become clouded and that county seats are won or lost on general election issues. That is a pity. It tends to add to the general sense that local government is somehow secondary and much less important than national government. Nevertheless, if one takes the view, which the Government clearly have taken, that the next set of local elections should be held on the same date as European ones, there are some merits in having a year&#146;s notice period.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07071035000209"></a>From the Government&#146;s point of view, I frankly cannot see the problem with a year&#146;s notice because we know the dates of both those elections. However, it makes a difference from the point of view of councils. For example, council members who are due to retire will need to know that they have to serve an extra month. That might not sound very long. However, people sometimes move away or become less active as they come to the end of their terms of office.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07071035000210"></a>If they are expected to serve out an extra period, there are questions about the level of representation. A year&#146;s notice gives the councils much more flexibility to alter standing orders and change dates of annual meetings and budget arrangements. The fact that the Electoral Commission is supporting one year&#146;s notice should at least give the Government pause for thought that this might be a good idea. A year would be consistent with the existing legislation, the Representation of the People Act 1983.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07071035000211"></a>A general climate of cynicism exists about the manipulation of dates. The noble Baroness referred earlier to&#151;heaven forfend&#151;the idea that parish council election dates might be manipulated. If so, I am sure that that accusation could be levelled even more here, whereas a year takes some heat out of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07071035000213"></a>We are in a situation where we are genuinely attempting to bend over backwards to meet what we believe is the convenience of the electorate. Sometimes the electorate are not all that interested. I certainly think that having two elections on the same day is the maximum that we can expect people to absorb. If there are both European and local elections, there is a fair gap between the two so they will not be confused in the minds of the electorate.</p>

<a name="70710-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07071035000214"></a>As for the question of six or 12 months, I come down on the side of six months. The Electoral Commission recommended 12 months but everyone concerned who is a political animal&#151;there are very few of them about, and their number is diminishing&#151;watches these things and looks for advantages and disadvantages and for someone pulling a fast one and all the rest of it. But events happen and things have to be taken into account. Six months is a decent period in which to give notice. After notice is given by order, that is the law and it has to be carried out. I fully understand the benefits and advantages of trying to minimise the number of times that electors have to go to the ballot box. On balance, I think that the Government&#146;s proposals in the Bill are just about right.</p>

I had not appreciated until quite recently just how much preparation is required by the returning officer and those working for the returning officer&#151;the council officials&#151;to book places for polling stations and a place to hold the count. I am talking partly about the London experience, the scale of which makes matters even more difficult. An enormous amount of work goes on behind the scenes, which even those of us who are closely involved do not appreciate. Time and again I have heard returning officers and those who support them complaining about the late notice that they receive from central government about small changes in the rules. They know that the changes are coming but they cannot act until the change is incorporated in an order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07071035000216"></a>Six months from today would be around Christmastime and the end of the year, so in terms of practicalities the time available would be cut to about five months. There are very good, practical and sensible reasons why the maximum proposed in the amendment&#151;one year&#151;should be pursued. One does not need to leave the decision until much later but, quite apart from the electorate, it would be enormously beneficial to the electoral officers who have to make the arrangements if the decision was made a year ahead.</p>

We believe that such a period is too long. I am delighted to see that the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has tabled an amendment proposing a six-month period, which is along the lines suggested by the government amendment.</p>

<a name="70710-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07071035000219"></a>A similar amendment to the 12-month amendment was tabled in another place following concerns raised by the Electoral Commission. The commission suggested that a 12-month period was needed for three reasons: to prevent present or future Governments from gaining political advantage; to give electoral administrators sufficient time to be prepared for a combined election, as we discussed; and to be consistent with existing legislation. In another place, the Government agreed to give the matter further consideration, which we have done. We accept and have always accepted that there needs to be a substantial period between the making of any order changing the date of a local government election and the election affected. Such a period is needed, as we heard, to give electoral administrators sufficient time to put the necessary arrangements in place.</p>

<a name="70710-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07071035000220"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, illustrated, there have been two recent examples of local government elections being changed: in 2004, the order that combined the local government and European elections was made in March; and, in 2001, following the foot and mouth outbreak, the change was made in April. As the noble Baroness suggested, we can all agree that that was short notice. In each case the circumstances were particular. I accept that such a period in the normal course of business is too short. After careful consideration, we believe that a minimum of six months is the right period and that this should be included in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07071035000221"></a>In deciding that six months was the appropriate period, we needed to weigh up the purpose of the order-making power in Clause 60, which was intended to ensure that local government and European elections could be combined in years when they coincide. This is more convenient for voters and has been shown to increase turnout, as has been noted in our discussion. We fear that, if the period is too great, the lack of flexibility would prevent the provisions from being used and we would lose the benefits of Clause 60. It is important that electoral administrators are given sufficient time to prepare for elections on what would be a later date than they were originally planning for. They need to be comfortable that after a certain date there will be no changes to the arrangements for local government elections.</p>

<a name="70710-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07071035000222"></a>As the Bill is currently drafted, although electoral administrators would be aware of the Government&#146;s intention to combine at an early stage, they would not be able to act with certainty until an order was made. Therefore, we agree that it is important for all those involved in local government elections to be aware of

We consider a six-month period to provide ample notice to electoral administrators, as well as to parties, candidates and electors.</p>

<a name="70710-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07071035000223"></a>Section 37 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 gave the Secretary of State the power to move the date of local government elections. However, to our knowledge, this power has been used only once. One of the reasons is that any order under Section 37 of the 1983 Act has to be made in the February of the year preceding the election year. This period of 15 months is a long way in advance of the election date. The Government&#146;s view is that even a 12-month period would have the effect of substantially reducing the effectiveness of Clause 60, to the point where it might not be practicable for decisions to move election dates to be made. We accept that an amendment needs to be made to Clause 60 to provide a cut-off date for orders to be made, but we do not accept that 12 months is necessary. We believe that six months is sufficient. We understand that the Electoral Commission believes that anything below six months would be problematic.</p>

<a name="70710-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07071035000224"></a>It is of the utmost importance that any change of date for local government elections is not, and is not perceived to be, made to achieve some political advantage. Ideally, one would wish to see any such move command the support of all parties. A major safeguard against perceived political advantage is that the order would need to be approved by a vote in this House. I do not agree that making the period 12 months, as distinct from six months, would provide any material or greater safeguard. As I hope that I have demonstrated, a 12-month period renders the provisions pointless. On that basis, I hope that noble Lords will feel that they do not need to press their amendments and that they can support the government amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07071035000229"></a>I am fascinated by the idea that Governments do not choose election dates for political advantage. Perhaps the logic of the Minister&#146;s statements is that we should have fixed-term Parliaments so that we know exactly when the dates of general elections will be. If she were able to persuade the Government to do that, electoral administrators would carry her around the streets of London, or anywhere else, on their shoulders, garlanded with flowers and all sorts of things. However, I do not hold out any hope for that.</p>

&#147;The new Department for Children, Schools and Families brings together for the first time ever in one place the responsibility for all policy across Government to promote the well-being of children and young people. With your permission I start this Statement with a proposition on which I believe every Member of this House and every parent and grandparent in our country can agree: every child matters, and we all have a responsibility to ensure that every child has the chance to develop their talents to the full.&#147;After decades of underperformance, we have turned the tide. Standards have risen&#151;over 58 per cent of 15 year-olds achieved five or more good GCSEs in 2006 compared to only 45 per cent in 1997. There has been new investment&#151;35,000 more teachers, 172, 000 new classroom assistants, over 1,100 new schools and over 1,200 Sure Start children&#146;s centres. Teenage pregnancy rates are at a 20-year low, reoffending rates among young people are down, and 600,000 children have been lifted out of poverty.&#147;But there remain significant challenges that require us to change and renew. Parents want a greater focus on standards, we have far more to do to close the attainment gap between poorer children and their better-off peers, there are still too many young people not staying on in education and training after 16, and 2.8 million children still live in poverty, with many falling behind in learning before they even start school and more likely to end up in trouble as they grow up.&#147;In this Statement today I can announce immediate steps we can take to reinforce our focus on standards in the classroom and personalised learning, to back teachers and improve discipline in and out of school, and to strengthen school leadership. We can take these steps as we also begin a national consultation on how we can put the needs of children at the centre of our policy-making and build a stronger, fairer Britain, breaking the barriers to opportunity  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1308"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>so that every child and young person has the chance to make the most of their talents, not just a privileged few.&#147;First, standards and personalised learning. A child who cannot read, write or master basic maths will never succeed in education. Our priority must be standards, not structures. We will renew our focus on the things that really matter to parents and meet their rising aspirations. That means getting the basics right. Since 1997 we have raised standards in literacy and numeracy in primary schools. We are implementing the recommendations of the Rose report into early reading to ensure that all schools and nurseries teach phonics properly. The Every Child a Reader pilot is now helping 5,000 six year-olds with significant literacy problems to learn to read.&#147;The next step is to raise our game in maths, building on the successful numeracy strategy we launched nearly 10 years ago. I can tell the House that Sir PeterWilliams, Chancellor of Leicester University and chair of the Advisory Committee on Maths Education, has agreed to lead a review of the teaching of maths. His review will look at effective methods of teaching and learning in primary schools and nurseries, and advise us on how to develop pupils&#146; deeper understanding of maths and on the development of our Every Child Counts pilots to help pupils falling behind in primary schools.&#147;Effective teaching is increasingly geared to the distinct needs and progress of individual children, so I want to see a greater focus on personalised learning, with appropriate support and schooling for gifted and talented children, those with special educational needs and those falling behind. Regular testing is essential for monitoring the progress of individual pupils, but there should be scope for schools to make well informed judgments on when pupils should be tested. While we do not support streaming, which makes a blanket and often arbitrary judgment on children&#146;s intelligence and can ignore their individual talents, I strongly support setting for individual subjects, with judgments made by heads and teachers according to the needs of their school.&#147;Today I can tell the House that, building on the &#163;1 billion we have already allocated to personalised learning in 2007-08 and following the recommendations of the Gilbert review, I am allocating &#163;150 million over the next three years to expand the highly successful Assessment for Learning programme to further help teachers build expertise in tracking individual pupil progress and monitoring and mentoring achievement. Greater personalisation, Assessment for Learning and our successful Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning programme will benefit all children, including high achievers. They will also help us to tackle underachievement and raise standards among disadvantaged children.&#147;As we expand our extended school programme of out-of-hours provision in sport, music and drama to every school by 2010, we need to ensure that children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their parents do not miss out but have a chance to  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1309"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>benefit from extra out-of-hours tuition and after-school clubs. So I can tell the House that over the next three years we will provide an additional &#163;265 million to enable extended schools to do more to support disadvantaged children and young people. By year three, the funding will enable all schools to offer these children two hours a week of group activities in term time, plus 30 hours of additional activities over the holidays. &#147;To secure our economic future and promote opportunity for all, we must also do more to improve the post-16 staying-on rate. We will legislate over the coming year to raise the education leaving age to 18. But we also need a 14-to-19 curriculum that is relevant and engages young people in learning, offering them the skills that they need for future study and to succeed in the workplace. Details of the first five new 14-to-19 diplomas will be available within the month, ready to be introduced into schools and colleges in September 2008. &#147;Secondly, as we drive up standards, we must also do more to back teachers, freeing them from unnecessary bureaucracy, promoting discipline and letting our professionals get on with the job in the classroom. We are committed to the current workforce reform programme, developed with our social partners, to free up teachers&#146; time to teach, and I have asked my department to examine what more we can do to reduce unnecessary burdens for teachers and heads. &#147;Later this week, when we report on our review of the secondary curriculum for 11 to 16 year-olds, we will ensure a more focused curriculum that teaches the basics but reduces prescription and puts more power in the hands of individual schools and teachers. That will enable schools to personalise their teaching to meet the needs of different pupils, enabling us to place trust in the professional judgment of heads and teachers. To give teachers the time to prepare for the new curriculum, I can announce that we will allow an extra inset day for all secondary schools in the school year 2007-08. &#147;Our Teach First scheme is attracting and keeping high-performing graduates working as teachers in some of our most challenging inner-city schools. From September, it will be extended from London and Manchester to the West Midlands and, by 2009, to Liverpool and Yorkshire and the Humber. Building on the Transition to Teaching programme, we will now consult on a new Teach Next programme to promote mid-career routes into teaching, especially for people from industry and the sciences. &#147;Teachers cannot teach effectively unless they also have powers to maintain discipline. Teachers now have, for the first time, new statutory powers to tackle disruptive behaviour, including legal rights to restrain violent pupils and confiscate property. &#147;Every child has the right to feel safe in school. We should expect good behaviour in all our schools and see it in all our schools, so Ofsted will shortly issue strong new guidance to inspectors which will make clear that behaviour by pupils that has a negative impact on learning is unacceptable. Repeated  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1310"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>low-level disruption, as well as more serious isolated incidents of bad behaviour, should not be tolerated. By making this clear, Ofsted will, in effect, raise the bar on what is satisfactory behaviour and what is not. Ofsted&#146;s inspectors will focus on behaviour during inspections and, where they find behaviour to be inadequate, they will conduct monitoring visits to make sure it improves. &#147;Thirdly, as well as driving up standards and promoting discipline, I want us to do more to back strong and innovative school leadership. Specialist schools are driving up standards across the country. Trust schools will cement partnerships between schools, businesses and other local organisations and bring new dynamism and innovation to support strong school leadership. &#147;Our academies programme is driving radical transformation in weak and failing schools in disadvantaged communities. All academies now actively collaborate with schools and colleges in their area, just as schools should co-operate with academies. Currently, all academies replacing local authority schools proceed with local authority endorsement at the feasibility stage, and at the funding agreement stage we already have a duty to consult local authorities and we take their concerns fully into account. &#147;Results in academies are improving faster than they are in other schools. Truancy rates are down. Increasingly, inner-city local authorities such as Hackney, Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield are putting new academies at the centre of their local school strategies. But the test of whether an organisation can be a potential sponsor should not be its bank balance but whether it can demonstrate leadership, innovation and commitment to act in the public interest.&#147;From today, I am abolishing the current requirement for universities and high performing schools and colleges to provide &#163;2 million before they can sponsor an academy. Many universities are already engaged with academies, and I now want every university to actively engage with them.&#147;At the heart of the innovation in the curriculum that academies make possible is flexibility, which we will maintain for all new academies, built on the platform of the core national curriculum, which all new academies will now follow in English, maths, science and ICT. Academies have told me that they make the greatest impact on standards when they are a central part of their local community. They already have a duty to collaborate with all other schools in their area and are inspected by Ofsted against this. In addition, we have now removed their VAT costs on their buildings when their facilities are used by the wider community. &#147;It is my belief that, as we move towards our target of 200 academies by 2010, rising thereafter to 400, we should now accelerate the pace of the academies programme over the next few years, with a much greater role for universities. This afternoon, the Minister with responsibility for schools and academies is announcing that funding agreements are being signed off for the following five new

To build a national consensus, to engage universities and the wider public and private sectors, and to drive forward our ambitions for children and young people&#146;s education, the Prime Minister and I will now chair a new National Council for Educational Excellence. &#147;This council and its members will act as advocates and champions to transform expectations and aspirations for the education system, to mobilise every section of the community behind our national mission to become a world leader in education and, in particular, our aspiration that every secondary school should have a business and university partner. &#147;Sir Michael Barber has agreed to act as senior adviser to the council, which will meet for the first time later this month. My department&#146;s focus is on raising standards in schools, backing teachers and promoting strong school leadership, but schools cannot bear the whole burden. All the evidence shows that a child&#146;s life chances&#151;and their chance of having a safe and happy childhood&#151;are decisively shaped by their experiences in the first 22 months of life, by early years education, by family income, a supportive family environment and by diet and the opportunity to play and do sport. We need excellent universal services for all children and families, but there will always be some children and families who face additional challenges. &#147;We must tackle the causes of child poverty, youth crime, family breakdown and wasted potential so that we can strengthen our society and deliver security and opportunity for all. We recognise the importance of early intervention and of targeted support for children with special educational needs and disabled children. As the new department takes over joint responsibility for youth justice with the Ministry of Justice, it is vital that here, too, we spot problems quickly, before they escalate into crises. &#147;This is a complex agenda. We will shortly publish our 10-year youth strategy, our national strategy on safeguarding and our strategy on teenage parents. I intend to use the opportunity of the new department and the remaining months of the spending review to consult widely on how we can use all the levers at

To help draw up this plan, over the next four months, we will consult teachers, children&#146;s professionals, universities, colleges, the voluntary sector, parents, children and young people themselves. To do so, Ministers in my department will co-chair three working groups alongside a leading practitioner. The three groups will look across the range of education and wider services affecting children and young people&#151;with one group for nought to seven year-olds, one on eight to 13 year-olds and another on 14 to 19 year-olds&#151;and involve experts from schools, colleges, children&#146;s services, health partners, the criminal justice system and the wider public, voluntary and private sectors. I plan to be able to report the results of this consultation and set out the emerging children&#146;s plan in the autumn. &#147;This is a challenging agenda, but getting it right is critical to the future of our country. Every child has talent; and, with the measures I have set out today and the consultation we now begin, we will now ensure that every child gets the best start in life and the support they need to make the most of their talents. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.

It is large and comprehensive, so I will concentrate on only a few issues this afternoon. No doubt, we will have many weeks and months to discuss this in detail.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07071035000249"></a>As my honourable friend Michael Gove said, a new commitment to aspiration, excellence, diversity and discipline in our schools is to be applauded. It goes without saying that we all have a responsibility to ensure that every child has a chance to develop their full potential, because every child matters. So, we welcome much of what has been announced, which is hardly surprising given that a good deal of it chimes with Conservative Party thinking&#151;not least, good discipline in our schools and access for all our children to good after-school activities.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07071035000250"></a>The proposals announced this afternoon are ambitious, but we have doubts about the Government&#146;s ability to deliver, based on their record of the past 10 years. If a child is deprived of the basics in literacy and numeracy, then all the exciting things that education has to offer will be lost, which is why we campaign vigorously for the teaching of synthetic phonics in our schools and welcomed the findings of the Rose review. Can the Minister assure us that phonics will be incorporated in the Every Child a Reader programme?</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07071035000251"></a>There has also been a good deal of concern that so much of the modern maths curriculum now requires reading skills, so children who have not mastered reading will also fall behind in maths. So, we were pleased that in their new focus on standards and  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1313"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rigour the Government are reviewing the way that maths is taught in our schools. Almost half of 11 year-olds do not reach expected levels in maths, and the proportion of pupils with good GCSEs in maths has fallen since 1997. The targets for numeracy have been missed in every spending round since 1997, and Ofsted has reported that the national numeracy strategy is having &#147;limited effects&#148;. Why, I wonder, have we had to wait 10 years for this review? Fewer than half the maths teachers in our schools have a maths degree. What is being done to attract more talented maths and science graduates into the classroom?</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07071035000252"></a>The Government, as we have heard today, are placing a great emphasis on personalised learning. We agree that ensuring that teaching is tailored to the needs of each child is valuable. Can the Minister explain how this will be achieved, given that the number of pupils in classes of more than 50 has risen in the past two years? That is particularly important among our youngest children. There is, however, concern that lots of children will get their personalised learning from computer screens. While technology has an important role to play in education, it is not and nor should it become a substitute for a teacher or whole-class teaching.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07071035000253"></a>An important part of personalised learning will be setting by ability. Twice last week I tried to tease out from the Minister the Government&#146;s intention on setting, and I shall try for a third time. The Minister said quite rightly that it would be up to head teachers to decide what to do; but, with only 40 per cent of lessons in secondary schools set by ability, how will the Government persuade the rest?</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07071035000254"></a>The Minister&#146;s commitment to academies, which build on the Conservative Government&#146;s city technology colleges, is beyond question. There is an energy and sense of purpose in academies. We are pleased that there are to be more, that the Government have spotted a good policy when they see one, and that they have adopted our proposals for relaxing the barriers to involvement in setting up new academies. However, one of their strengths is their ability to run their own affairs. I wonder whether the Minister shares our concerns that their very attractiveness may be undermined by placing them under the control of local authorities once more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07071035000255"></a>In 2001, my right honourable friend Iain Duncan Smith, in looking to new ways of delivering policy, created a shadow department for children and families, so we welcome the creation of the new Department for Children, Schools and Families, which has one of the most important briefs and faces some of the most difficult challenges. As the Secretary of State said, getting it right is critical to the future of our country. Conservatives have always had at their heart a commitment to expand opportunity and to champion aspiration for all. We will work with the Government where such measures that they propose are clearly in the best interests of our nation&#146;s children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07071041000003"></a>The Minster talked about turning the tide, and I imagined a rather amusing picture of him standing on the beach trying to hold the tide back. The Government have of course done a great deal to raise standards, which we willingly acknowledge. The Minister gave a long list of the wonderful things that the Government have done, but forgot to mention one or two things. For instance, although 58 per cent of 15 year-olds achieve five or more good GCSEs, the numbers where that includes English and maths are still disgracefully low. About a quarter of young people leave school with no better than a level D GCSE. Teenage pregnancy rates are at a 20-year low, but we still have one of the highest rates in Europe. Although 600,000 children have been lifted out of poverty, the Government&#146;s target was 1 million. However, I do not wish to sound a sour note. The Government have done a great deal, but there is such a lot more to do.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07071041000004"></a>The Minister said that parents want a greater focus on standards. However, parents really want every school to be a good school. They should not be forced to use what choice they have to choose a school on the other side of town, taking their child all the way there with the consequent effects on traffic congestion and global warming.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07071041000005"></a>I was happy to hear the Minister say that the Government&#146;s priority must be standards and not structures. That is a U-turn, because the Government&#146;s agenda has been structures rather than standards, producing a dizzying variety of schools about which parents need a great deal of information to make whatever choice they have.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07071041000006"></a>The Minster raised a large number of issues. First, he talked about the importance of ensuring that all schools and nurseries teach phonics properly. I have some reservations about that idea. There are many good reading programmes and it should be up to the professionalism of the teacher to decide what is appropriate for each child and at what stage. For example, it is simply not appropriate to teach phonics to a child until they have reached the appropriate level in listening and speaking. Here I mention the need for more speech therapists in schools&#151;and, indeed, in nursery schools, because early intervention is so important.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07071041000007"></a>The Minister talked about personalised learning and the importance of adding extra people to help children who are struggling with their literacy. We mentioned last week that diagnostic reading software can be a very useful tool in the armoury of a teacher in helping children who are struggling with reading&#151;not just at the beginning, but at the end of primary&#151;to get their reading up to an appropriate level so that they can benefit from the materials put before them at secondary school. Very often, they stop after their second SATs and do not go any further. That is why we have this transition problem. I shall not repeat the questions asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, about maths teachers, but we are equally anxious about the answers.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07071041000008"></a>The Minister talked about a greater focus on personalised learning with appropriate support. Does that mean that he will be looking at the process of statementing? We on these Benches feel that it is important that statementing is done by an appropriate group of professionals and that it is separated from  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1315"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the providers of the services. We welcome the extra resources, but do they also mean additional counsellors and family outreach workers in schools outside the classroom as well as teachers?</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07071041000009"></a>I also welcome the fact that the Government are thinking of allowing teachers to make more of their own judgments about when children should be tested. However, the problem is not so much the assessment as what is done with it, and so I come to league tables. These Benches feel that there is a need to broaden the criteria for them to include more value-added information to help parents to make their judgment about what the school is doing.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07071041000010"></a>We accept that the social and emotional aspects of learning programme has been very successful. The Government seem to put great emphasis on it, but I am still puzzled about why they will not make PSHE mandatory. Will there be any development on that?</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07071041000011"></a>We also welcome the additional money for extended schools, but two hours a week is not very much and could be gobbled up in using the breakfast club so that there would be nothing left for leisure and other broadening activities. Is there any ambition to make that more in future? I also point out that, when schools have extended hours, there are child protection issues and issues about children travelling home a little later at night. That needs to be thought about.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07071041000012"></a>We look forward to the legislation coming before us to increase the age for leaving education to 18. I am pleased that the Minister said &#147;education leaving age&#148; not &#147;school leaving age&#148; because it is crucial that the curriculum offered is appropriate. The provision must be of high quality if young people are being forced to stay until 18. These Benches are still worried about the level of preparedness for the 14 to 19 diplomas. Some local authorities and schools seem to think that it is way off down the track and are not prepared at all.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07071041000013"></a>The Minister mentioned that schools will have reduced prescription about what they teach beyond the core curriculum. However, that is not new. The Education Act 2002 gave schools the power to innovate, and not many of them have used it.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07071041000014"></a>The Minister mentioned the new statutory powers to tackle disruptive behaviour and restrain violent pupils. I repeat my plea for all teachers to have training in this, otherwise we could have disasters.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07071041000015"></a>Can the Minister clarify whether the story in the <I>Financial Times</I> that no LEA will be forced to have an academy if it does not want it is correct? Even if that story is true, it would only be cosmetic if having a brand-new school building where it is much needed is linked to that school being an academy. Having said that, we welcome the &#163;2 million barrier being taken away from those who know about education and who want to open an academy or sponsor one. Universities do, and they are the people who should be sponsoring academies, if we are to have them.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07071041000016"></a>The noble Lord again mentioned the duty to collaborate with all other schools in the area. No school is an island; every brand-new, shiny school has an effect on the applications to all other schools in the area. Only the local authorities can plan this sort of  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1316"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1316</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provision across the board. I encourage the Government to do what they said that they would and make sure that they take into account the local authorities&#146; views on this. Now that we will have 400 academies, can we stop this pretence that all academies are replacing failing schools? They are not.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07071041000017"></a>We also welcome the council that the Minister announced, but how much is it going to cost and how will value for money be assessed? How will its work be reported to Parliament? We certainly agree that we need excellent universal services for all children and families. Only when these services are universal will there be no stigma to any family taking them up. Universal services to children and families promote social mobility and social cohesion from the earliest days, when children all grow up together.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07071041000018"></a>Youth justice is one of the new responsibilities coming into the Minister&#146;s department. When I visited a young offender institution recently, I was most concerned to discover that many of the release plans break down so quickly and frequently. Part of this is because there is nobody there to make sure that it all happens as planned. We all know that when young people go into these institutions, the release plan is worked on from day one. They go out with all flags flying, but often, sadly, it all breaks down and their education plan or whatever just does not happen. With that new responsibility, will the Minister look into that? If the plans were implemented, we could reduce reoffending.</p>

I prefer to put it rather differently. A strong sense of shared purpose has animated us all in education over the last few decades. As a nation together, across parties and across different parts of society, we have made education a much stronger priority. This is not like King Canute trying to achieve the impossible on the beach but a perfectly possible set of ambitions that we have taken on as a nation. A substantially higher proportion of our young people should achieve to high levels, comparable to the proportions that we have seen in other countries. We should get as close as we possibly can to having all our young people mastering basic skills, which is possible with good-quality teaching starting from the earliest years. The failure of our education system and inadequate investment in the past prevented us from getting there. However, through a strong sense of shared national purpose over recent years, including an injection of significant new investment in the past 10 years, we have seen progress towards goals that are readily attainable provided that we have the national will to achieve them. They are not utopian or unachievable in any sense.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07071041000020"></a>I was glad to see in the responses of the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Morris, a strong sense of unified purpose. Usually when I write my notes on responses, it is the hostile points that I need to answer that occupy most of the space. In fact, I agree with most of the points made by the noble Baronesses. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said that we were stealing her clothes. I would say that she  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1317"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is stealing ours, but I am happy that we should engage in mutual cross-dressing on many of these issues, because it matters so much to our schools, young people and families that we do not see these as party-political issues. I do not believe that the questions of discipline in schools, after-school activities, setting, good-quality school leadership, educational participation to the age of 18, valuing our teachers more or any of these issues should be regarded as party political. The issue is simply one of will, purpose, investment and real determination to achieve results, which I believe we share on all sides of the Chamber.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07071041000021"></a>I welcome most of the comments made by both the noble Baronesses and the support that their parties have offered. On the more specific comments, I agree for example that ICT is not a substitute for good teachers. Hand in hand with the significant investment that we have had in ICT over the past 10 years has gone a significant increase in the numbers of teachers and assistants. I agree that we need assistants of all kinds, including counsellors and family outreach workers, an issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. Of course, the big increase in the numbers of assistants has included outreach workers of the kind that she described.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07071041000022"></a>I am glad that both noble Baronesses welcome the steps that we have taken to engage universities much more strongly in the education system, including in academies; I welcome the fact that they agree with us on the relaxation of the financial barriers to participation in the academies programme. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and I have differences, in theory, on academies; I simply note, as the Minister, the huge enthusiasm among many Lib Dem authorities for engaging in the academies programme. Indeed, the London Borough of Southwark, whose leader and I engage frequently on the issue of academies, has one of the highest densities of academies of any local authority in the country and, unless my facts are mistaken, it is run by the Liberal Democrats. So in many areas, even where we profess to disagree, the common ground between us is much greater than might be thought from some of the rhetoric.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07071041000023"></a>Let me respond to some of the specific other questions that were raised. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, asked whether the attractiveness of academies would be undermined by placing them under local authorities. It is very important to understand what we have said today in respect of academies. We welcome the fact that academies that are replacing existing local authority schools are, in effect, jointly commissioned by my department and local authorities. Local authorities are increasingly seeking out potential sponsors, including universities, colleges, businesses and individuals. We welcome that and want to build on it. We want the new local authority of the future to be increasingly a commissioner of services, including educational services, and not the direct provider. However, the management and operation of academies will continue to be subject to their sponsors and their boards of governors; there will be no change in the effective autonomy that they have in that respect.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07071041000024"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, raised the issue of the maths review and said that she had doubts over our ability to deliver. However, the national literacy  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1318"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and numeracy programmes over the past 10 years have been extremely successful. The proportion of 11 year-olds reaching the required level 4 in the key stage 2 tests has risen dramatically since 1997. More than 100,000 children a year now reach the standard required at the age of 11 in maths than was the case 10 years ago. So there has been a significant improvement.</p>

<a name="70710-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07071041000025"></a>But we need to be honest about the fact that one in five 11 year-olds is still not up to that standard. We believe that it is right to look in a fundamental way, after 10 years&#146; experience of the operation of the national numeracy strategy, at how we can improve that situation. Sir Peter Williams will look not only at pedagogy, which is important, and at how mathematics is taught, but also&#151;linking into another question raised by the noble Baroness&#151;at the qualification and training of teachers. Unless the teachers have the competence to teach mathematics effectively in primary schools, they will not be able to deliver higher standards, particularly at the more challenging end of the ability range where pupils are falling behind.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70710-0007.htm"/>


<a name="70710-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07071041000026"></a>We are also asking Sir Peter to advise us on the design of effective catch-up schemes in maths, which will perform a role similar to that of the Every Child a Reader programmes. As the noble Baroness and I constantly say in exchanges across the Chamber, we want the catch-up to be as limited as possible because we have got it right first time. We want to ensure that, by using effective phonics programmes for teaching reading and effective programmes for teaching numeracy, we steadily and dramatically reduce the proportion of those in the earliest primary years who fall behind.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07071041000027"></a>That links, of course, directly into personalised learning, an issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. I noticed that in another place her colleague David Laws, who is new to education, said about personalised learning that he now understood what the educational jargon meant; he thought that it was what teachers had been doing for 50 years, which, of course, it is&#151;every teacher seeks to personalise their provision. However, small-group tuition, programmes for gifted and talented pupils, a much wider array of after-school activities and so on are all expensive areas of educational provision and it is important to consider what we are proposing in terms of personalisation hand in hand with the increased resources that we are making available to schools. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, it is only by providing more resources to schools that it is possible for them to become 10-hour-a-day institutions that offer a whole programme of after-school activities&#151;including the arts, sport and so on, which were not present before&#151;as well as childcare and other provision of that kind. We are seeking increasingly to personalise provision as we provide more resources in ways that simply were not possible before, because the resources were not there to provide smaller-group tuition, a wider curriculum and a much richer range of after-school activities.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07071041000028"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked about the national council. I cannot tell her precisely how much it will cost, but I can say that it will be lean and mean. We do not intend it to be a great drain on the public purse; it will need only the resources necessary  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1319"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1319</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to cover its running costs. The first meeting will take place shortly, and we will soon thereafter set out the council&#146;s goal and work plan, which is what we will judge its work against. A very distinguished group of business leaders, university leaders and others is engaging in it, which testifies to our profound shared national purpose. I agree with the noble Baroness&#146;s points about the importance of youth justice to the new department. I will come back to her on her comments on release plans in particular.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07071041000029"></a>The reduced prescription that we are talking about, in the key stage 3 review whose conclusions will be published shortly, is available not just to a small number of schools that, for example, apply for the power to innovate, which the noble Baroness mentioned. It will apply to all schools, so that we give greater flexibility in the development of the curriculum, including a vocational work-related curriculum for those young people for whom it is suitable beyond the age of 14.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07071041000030"></a>The noble Baroness rightly said that the introduction of the new diplomas is an immense challenge. I do not minimise the challenge; it is one of the biggest things that we will be doing in education over the next period. It is important that we get it right. Personalisation is not simply about additional resources, but also about having a more fit-for-purpose curriculum. If we are honest and look at the history of education policy in this country over the past 50 years, we see that the area in which we have been weakest is vocational and work-related skills and making them properly available in schools.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07071041000031"></a>There are immense challenges ahead. I am delighted that we have such strong consensus across the Chamber. We intend to continue to build on the progress that we have made over the past 10 years.</p>

Given what was said in the Statement&#151;the greater emphasis on maths, the relaxation in the rigours of the national curriculum to allow more space for schools, personalisation of learning and various other directions&#151;can we hope for a proper consideration of the place of IGCSE in schools? It is such a successful examination&#151;a great British examination&#151;taken up by over 100 independent schools now as providing something over and beyond GCSE. It seems ridiculous that we should ban it in state schools, when Botswana is putting all its pupils through IGCSE maths. We are limiting our ambitions to mastering basic maths. We must have something that goes further than that and allows the expression of the great achievement that is possible by so many pupils in the examination structure.

However, I know that the IGCSE is very dear to the noble Lord&#146;s heart and that of other noble Lords. As he knows, we commissioned the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to look at the whole issue of the IGCSE. It has published a report and consulted. We are considering the results of that consultation now and I hope that we will have more to say soon.</p>

I would like to know a little more about the behavioural side. This new department gives us a great opportunity to improve our record of early intervention on a range of behavioural problems&#151;whether health problems such as obesity or more serious behavioural problems resulting from family breakdown, poor parenting and so forth. If we are really clever at this, it does not have to be about more money. It is about getting better at identifying problems at an early stage and intervening. Rather than having more of the existing agencies, do we not need a pool of teachers who are trained to intervene with families and children who are getting into difficulties? Teachers going into such situations will often be more acceptable than people wearing a welfare hat.</p>

<a name="07071041000041"></a><b><a name="70710-0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07071041000156"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, as ever, my noble friend makes a very good point. Having trained practitioners in this area can make a big difference to the way that behaviour is managed in schools. Increasingly, schools have trained practitioners in the way that he suggested. The additional resources available to schools will enable us to have trained professionals in a way that would not have been possible in the past because there was simply not a large enough budget.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07071041000042"></a>However, serious behavioural problems are rare in schools. Indeed, Ofsted's own data show that, at 3 per cent, the proportion of secondary schools judged unsatisfactory on behaviour is at an historic low and half what it was in 1997, so we must keep this issue in proportion. A good deal of the challenge lies in helping families at the earliest stage of their children's lives. The big expansion of children&#146;s centres, Sure Start and support for families in the earliest years of their children's lives will make a big difference to behaviour over time. In particular, it will equip parents to become better parents and support their children better through school. I hope, therefore, to see that proportion of bad behaviour decline still further.</p>

I have two questions for the Minister. First, on page 3 when discussing the new 14 to 19 diplomas, the Statement says that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="07071041000116"></a>&#147;Details of the first five new 14 to 19 diplomas will be available within the month, ready to be introduced into schools and colleges in September 2008&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071041000112"></a>That is only a year and two months away, but the curricula have not yet been published. The QCA has been careful in terms of allowing federations of schools and colleges to go through the gateway, and a number will effectively be piloting the diplomas in the first year, but am I right in thinking that the new diplomas will not generally be available within schools until the pilots have been completed?</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07071041000044"></a>On diplomas, will the Minister assure us that there will be sufficient careers guidance within schools early enough for young people to be able to make proper choices between the GCSE and vocational routes? That is essential because careers guidance in schools has not been up to the mark recently. It would be good to see it improved.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07071041000045"></a>On academies and universities, the Statement says that the Government have an,</p>
<ul><a name="07071041000140"></a>&#147;aspiration that every secondary school should have a business and university partner&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071041000113"></a>Does that mean that existing academies will acquire university partners and that academies sponsored by universities will acquire business partners? The language on page 7 says very explicitly that,</p>
<ul><a name="07071041000141"></a>&#147;every secondary school should have a business and university partner&#148;.</ul>

We are starting with a more limited scale in the first year, after which we will learn the lessons from that and scale up. She is right, too, in saying that guidance for  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1322"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>students up to the age of 14 in potential diploma lines will be vital, alongside guidance on potential GCSE options. That will be one thing that we will look at very carefully as we begin that work.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07071041000047"></a>On the business and university partners, we are saying that every secondary school over time will have one. That is an aspiration policy for the future&#151;we are not in a position now to ensure it&#151;but we believe that it is a goal that we should work towards. Looking at how we can make that achievable is one of the goals that we are setting for the new national council that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has set up. Noble Lords on all side of the House will probably regard that as a desirable goal. It is absolutely desirable that state schools, as private schools have done since time immemorial, should have the closest possible links with universities and should simply take it for granted that they have university partners, as almost every private school that I know does.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07071041000048"></a>We think it right to build on the success of the specialist schools programme, whereby schools have sponsorship to become specialist schools, much of which has come from local businesses, which have often given support in terms of governance, curriculum, mentoring, work placements and so on. They have given support for schools in kind that is much greater than the financial support that they have offered. Building on that, it will be possible to have a much richer array of business partners for schools. That directly links to the noble Baroness&#146;s first point. If we have much stronger business links with schools, the diplomas will also be more successful, because the emphasis on work-related learning and the quality of the work-related learning that takes place in schools will be enhanced.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07071041000049"></a>I do not disguise from the House the scale of the ambition. We have 3,500 secondary schools, so it is a very ambitious goal to ensure that they all have a meaningful higher education and business partner, but we believe that it is an appropriate goal. Learning from the experience of the specialist schools, academies and the large number of trust schools being established, many of which have university and business partners, we believe that it is an achievable goal for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07071041000051"></a>One of the programmes that the Minister mentioned seemed to stop at Yorkshire and the Humber. Will the Minister please not forget the needs of Tyneside? I say that coming as I do from the north-east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07071041000052"></a>On the further expansion of the academies programme, will the Minister clarify the position of the Church of England-sponsored academies? Will they be treated in the same way as those he mentioned that will be sponsored by universities?</p>

I would dearly like to see it play a role in the north-east, too. We are expanding it progressively because it is very  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1323"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1323</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>important that the quality of the management of the programme, which has been very high, and the attractiveness that it has to high-performing graduates, is not diluted as it expands. That is why we are moving at the rate of one city a year, building up from London where it started. It is a testament to the success that we are having in recruiting good graduates into teaching that, from the leading universities, which 10 years ago were sending very few of their graduates into state school teaching, we now have massive overapplication to Teach First. This year there were over 1,500 applications for 300 places.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07071041000054"></a>Teach First is regarded as a highly prestigious programme, which is a testament to the changing attitudes of young people to teaching&#151;and very welcome that is too. It is also a testament to reform, because the establishment of Teach First, which was done in partnership with the teaching unions, involved a complete rewriting of the rules on teacher education. We ended the requirement to do a full-time PGCE for one year; in place of that, teachers train at Canterbury Christ Church University for six weeks over the summer and are then placed in properly supervised groups in schools. Their commitment to teach is for only for two years. We were led to think that the overhead cost of training them might not be justified but, in fact, more than half of Teach First graduates stay in teaching for more than two years, which is an immensely valuable resource to our schools. I give the right reverend Prelate the assurance that we shall seek to expand the programme and not neglect the needs of the north-east.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07071041000055"></a>The Church of England has been a very important and highly successful promoter of academies. As the right reverend Prelate will have heard, one of the new academies that I announced today is a Church of England academy in the London Borough of Southwark. We want to see the church play a key role in the expansion of the programme, as local communities wish to see the church engaged&#151;because this is all about local consent and preference. However, it will not have escaped the notice of the right reverend Prelate that the church is not itself a high-performing university, college or school. It has many other attributes but those three are not among them, so it will not qualify for, so to speak, passing &#147;Go&#148; without making any payments&#151;the concession that we are announcing today.</p>

In addition to the assurances that he gave my noble friend Lady Morris on preserving the existing freedoms of the academies, do the Government have any plans&#151;based on the success of the initial academies&#151;further to extend their freedom so that they have more freedom to develop in ways that will enable them to attract parents and pupils?</p>

Therefore, the Government may want to consider allowing sets to be created across schools to provide that high-ability teaching group.</p>

<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="07071041000059"></a><b><a name="70710-0007.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07071041000162"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, it is open to schools to collaborate as the noble Lord suggests and to have groups that span schools. That is a matter for local arrangements. It is also possible to have oversubscription criteria for schools, such as banding. I am getting rather technical now, but there are systems of admission that ensure a proper cross-section of the ability range and therefore make it more likely that schools have top sets than they might otherwise have done&#151;although that depends on their being oversubscribed. If they are undersubscribed, they may have difficulties in that regard. But on the issue that the noble Lord raised&#151;the ability of pupils to be taught across schools&#151;that is possible and will become increasingly common as we develop diplomas and see more collaborative working between schools in offering a wider curriculum.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07071041000060"></a>On the noble Lord&#146;s point about new schools being established, under the Education and Inspections Act 2006 local authorities have a duty to respond to proposals for the establishment of new schools and can themselves commission new schools. It very much depends on the commissioning state of mind of the local authority. A local authority that wants to see new provision can commission it, and there are requirements under the 2006 Act that new schools that local authorities decide to commission must be subject to open competitions.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07071041000061"></a>We have just seen the first two competitions for new schools completed, the first in Haringey and the second in Southampton. I shall send the noble Lord details of those competitions, as I know that he has a keen interest in this matter. What is striking is the wide range of different proposals coming forward in those competitions&#151;and these were the very first ones. A vibrant debate took place in local communities in both Haringey and Southampton about the rival merits of the different proposals, the different curriculum strengths, and the strengths and weaknesses of the different educational partners associated with the proposals. I believe that the strength of competition that will develop over time as the school competitions advance will be very great and that they will be both welcome to new promoters wanting to establish schools and beneficial to local communities, which will have a wider range of options from which to choose and be more likely, therefore, to secure a high-quality school as a result.</p>

<a name="70710-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07071041000062"></a>Academies already have substantial freedoms and flexibilities so I am not sure what the noble Lord had in mind, but if he has any particular ideas that he would like to put to me, I would be glad to look at them. There is great flexibility within the academy framework to enable innovation to take place. We have not found that academy sponsors feel hidebound.</p>

To what extent will it be directed from the centre? To what extent will its advice sit on the table? The advancement of literacy is vital for raising standards in both education and behaviour.

We are providing a great deal of high-quality resource to schools on the teaching practices in respect of reading which come out of the Rose report. We have just issued to schools new teaching materials, handbooks and CD-ROMs, which give good supporting guidance to them on how to implement Rose. The materials have been extremely well received by schools and, although we do not formally direct them, virtually all of them will implement Rose. The materials that we have put out have had a very positive response from teachers.</p>

However, people of secondary school age value their friendships greatly and develop through them. Where setting takes place in a big school, and you are with one group of people in one subject and another group for another, you keep losing your friends, whereas with streaming you are with the same group and you benefit from being with friends throughout your time at school, except that you have the flexibility of moving between streams if you develop in such a way that you can.

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07071041000071"></a>The noble Lord said: This small group of amendments deals with some important matters. Amendments Nos. 112, 171, 172 and 255, tabled in my name, would replace the supplementary vote with the alternative vote. The other amendment in the group, in the name of my noble friend, is rather more ambitious. She will speak to it in due course.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07071041000072"></a>Amendment No. 112 would replace the existing system of the supplementary vote for mayoral elections with the alternative vote. My other three amendments would use the alternative vote, rather than the supplementary vote, for elections which the Government proposed for any elected executives. We have not discussed elected executives yet, so the amendments pre-empt the question whether we will have them, but it seems sensible to discuss the two voting systems together. The third area in which the supplementary vote is used is London mayoral elections. My amendments do not cover them, because they are subject to different legislation, but I would in spirit make the same change in their case, too.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07071041000073"></a>The supplementary vote is a rather cack-handed voting system, which the Government cobbled together when they set up elections for mayors and the Mayor of London. It is election by a traditional &#147;X&#148;-voting system. After the first vote, people are given the opportunity of marking their second preference with an &#147;X&#148; in a different column. The two candidates with the most first-preference votes progress to the second round. Any second-preference votes for those two remaining candidates are then transferred to them and added to their total, giving the result of the election.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07071041000074"></a>Before moving the amendment, I should perhaps have welcomed the Minister to what I think is her first discussion in Committee on electoral systems. There will no doubt be many more to come. They are all great fun.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07071041000075"></a>The supplementary vote differs from the alternative vote in that candidates are numbered one to five by voters and votes are simply transferred until somebody has gained over half of the votes cast. That system is used for the election of the leader and deputy leader of the Labour Party, so it has achieved a certain amount of fame recently. It is used also in elections in your Lordships' House, so it is not without some background. If it is good enough for the Labour Party, it should be good enough for mayors and elected executives; and if it is good enough for the House of Lords, it should certainly be good enough for mayors and elected executives.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1328"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70710-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07071041000076"></a>What are the problems with the supplementary vote, and why did I say it was cack-handed and cobbled together? First, it seems to cause unnecessary confusion. The number of spoiled ballot papers is significantly higher than usual, certainly higher than in normal elections: around 3 per cent in the first-preference count and around 8 to 10 per cent on the second count, not including those that cannot transfer because they would go to the wrong candidate. I had difficulty researching previous elections by the supplementary vote. I asked the Government what the situation was, but they said that they did not collect data. It is time that somebody started.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07071041000077"></a>Secondly, the supplementary vote is not efficient, and there is a very high drop-out rate on the transfer to the second round; it can be as high as 80 per cent and is typically 60 or 70 per cent. Although people are offered a second vote, in general most of those votes do not count. They are not used because people use their second preference for somebody who has already dropped out, and the vote is then lost. Your second vote only counts if it goes to one of the candidates in the top two; therefore whether your second vote counts is accidental, which is not an efficient voting system.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07071041000078"></a>Thirdly, the supplementary vote distorts choice. As I have said, whether your vote is counted on the second ballot is accidental; therefore, that must distort the result. I have been doing a bit of research and have just two or three examples.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07071041000079"></a>The 2005 Torbay mayoral election was unusual because there were 14 candidates, despite which the turnout was only 24 per cent. However, 15,000&#151;62 per cent&#151;of the votes were for candidates not in the top two. Of those, nearly 12,000&#151;almost 49 per cent&#151;were not transferred. As a transferable voting system, it was a flop.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07071041000080"></a>In the election for the mayor of Hackney in 2002, 76 per cent of votes did not transfer to the second round; the rate was almost as high in the next election, four years later. There were a huge number of rejected ballot papers in Hackney: 619 were rejected because of voting for more than one candidate as the first preference; 209 were unmarked or wholly void for uncertainty; and 4,400 were rejected in part. The system was not working properly. As I have said, up to 10 per cent of papers tend to be rejected as void or spoilt at either stage.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07071041000081"></a>In the Mansfield mayoral election earlier this year, nearly 8 per cent of ballot papers were spoilt. There was a great scandal at the level of spoilt ballot papers in the Scottish parliamentary election; however, the same level seems to apply in these mayoral elections. That cannot be a good thing.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07071041000082"></a>Those are typical. I will not detain noble Lords with statistics on lots of other places. Typically a high proportion of votes are not transferred and quite a lot of people who want to vote spoil their papers inadvertently. About 10 per cent of ballot papers are spoilt. Around two-thirds of second-preference votes are not transferred. Therefore, the system is not efficient.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07071041000083"></a>The alternative vote is easier to use; it gives maximum choice and is easy to understand because anybody can number. It is an efficient system in that a high proportion of the votes are transferred until somebody is either elected or is named the runner-up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07071041000084"></a>I do not know why the supplementary vote was invented. Most electoral systems are a matter of principle&#151;what they are based on&#151;the purpose that they exist for and the outcomes. We can argue about first past the post, the alternative vote and various kinds of proportional representation but those arguments are about principles, purpose and outcomes. The supplementary vote is a defective system and is not fit for purpose. It does not work, and that is the main argument against it.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07071041000085"></a>I beg to move Amendment No. 112, which would introduce the alternative vote instead of the supplementary vote for elected mayors.</p>

My modest amendment&#151;I do not see it as ambitious contrary to what my noble friend said&#151;seeks to introduce the single transferable vote to local council elections.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07071041000087"></a>On these Benches, we are dedicated advocates for the single transferable vote and like to bring it up at every opportunity. We have always made the case that in a well functioning democracy every vote should have equal weight. In first past the post elections, this evidently is not the case. Lest I be charged with naked self-interest, there are parts of England, south-west London, for example, where first past the post works very much in favour of the Liberal Democrats, but that still does not make it right.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07071041000088"></a>The single transferable vote provides an opportunity for political parties to get more people elected from underrepresented groups, such as women and the black and minority ethnic population. It has never been more important to improve that representation.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07071041000089"></a>The Government have the example of Scotland to see how the single transferable vote has worked and will be able to assess the difference it makes to how Scottish councils are governed. We also have proportional voting systems in operation for the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament, the European Parliament and the London Assembly; therefore, it is not new. I would like the Government to consider the single transferable vote as an option for English local government elections as they have done in Scotland.</p>

Therefore, I will not be supporting these amendments but could not resist saying how much I would want to oppose proportional representation.</p>

Probably the reason that the Labour Party resisted major change is that the existing system favoured it. Before anyone talks about chicanery or corruption or anything like that, one has to understand that the method and manner whereby an electoral system can bring party-political advantage have been there from time immemorial. You win some, you lose some.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07071041000093"></a>To give my own illustration, in 1964 we won Enfield council by 31 per cent to 29 per cent; four years later, we lost by 51 per cent to 9 per cent. That reflected substantially the change in the mood of the people of Enfield. Over the past 40 or 50 years, we have been not only recognising the illogicality of the existing systems but genuinely seeking to engage the electorate much more than in the recent past.</p>

I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, for welcoming me to my first House of Lords debate on electoral systems. I have what may be a guilty secret to share: I have been rather enjoying the debate. It could be a mistake to admit that.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07071041000096"></a>As I am sure the Committee would expect me to say, every voting system has advantages and disadvantages. The Government acknowledge that there are arguments both for and against the various proportional voting systems, and we have introduced new voting systems for the devolved Administrations as well as for the mayoral elections in local authorities. As we know, mayors in local authorities are elected by the supplementary vote system. We have also proposed in Part 3 of the Bill that the supplementary vote system be used for electing an elected executive. More widely, the elections conducted in the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Greater London Assembly use the additional member system, and for the European Parliament the list system is used. In each of those cases there was a good reason to adopt the voting system that is now in place.</p>

<a name="70710-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07071041000097"></a>Noble Lords seek today to change the system for electing mayors across England from the supplementary vote system to the single transferable vote system. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, also wishes the directly elected executive to be returned via the additional member system. He has set out why he considers those systems are advantageous. However, the Government do not believe that now is the time to make changes to any of the electoral systems in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07071041000098"></a>The noble Baronesses&#146; amendments were described as both ambitious and modest. The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, set out why they wish to see the single transferable vote used for elections to principal and

However, that would mean that the first past the post system would no longer be used. One of the advantages of the first past the post system is that it ensures a direct relationship between those who are elected and the electorate within a specific geographical area. This system has historically been used to elect councillors to all local authorities. By tying members to a geographical area, a ward or a division which is constructed to reflect the identities and interests of communities, first past the post ensures that citizens know who represents them and, very importantly, representatives know whom they are representing. We believe that that is a significant advantage of the current system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07071041000099"></a>The Government are, however, carrying out a review of the new voting systems used in the UK for the devolved Administrations, the European Parliament and the London mayoral and assembly elections. I hope and believe that this review will pick up the issues of confusion, transfers and spoilt papers to which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, pointed. We are of the view that it would be inappropriate to pre-empt the findings of this review by encouraging the introduction of changes to the voting systems in the Bill.</p>

First, on behalf of my noble friend who is proposing STV in local elections, it is rather odd that the Government are not going to allow some councils that might want to move to STV as a pilot scheme to do so, particularly as most of those councils are currently controlled by a majority of Liberal Democrats and would almost certainly go without overall control under STV. In terms of political advantage, I would have thought that the Minister would be grabbing our hands off, but never mind.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07071041000102"></a>The Minister also said that STV would do away with the link between the geographical area, the councillor and the electors. That is not true. STV requires multi-member electoral areas which we have, as we discussed, in many areas in local government. They might be a bit bigger than three-member wards or they might be three-member wards, but the Scottish local government system has just moved from single-member wards towards those with two, three or four councillors. They retain as much of a link as I have in my ward, where two colleagues sit on the council with me. Whether I get elected by STV is a different matter, but who knows?</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para1"></a>

That is not a proportional representation system; it is a different way of electing a single person. I hope that those are helpful comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07071041000104"></a>I shall also reply very briefly to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. Again, we are not proposing proportional representation for the election of mayors because you cannot divide one mayor between different people; it is just a different way of electing the mayor. I ask her whether she and the Conservative Party support the supplementary vote system or whether they would like to abolish it and go back to first past the post for elections of mayors. We already have a different system for electing mayors. My submission is that it does not work; the system was bust before it started. It ought to be replaced with a system that actually does what the supplementary vote system sets out to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07071041000105"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Graham, said that we had lots of outlandish electoral systems, but I do not think that the one which I am trying to abolish&#151;the supplementary vote system&#151;exists anywhere else in the world. It is not outlandish in a technical sense; it is an invention of this country and it is time that we uninvented it.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07071041000106"></a>I hope that this was a useful discussion. There is a problem here: the supplementary vote system does not work properly. It has all sorts of problems. Whatever system is used in future for mayors and for any elected executives that ever get off the ground, this system is not the answer. I hope that as part of their review the Government will seriously think about it. My question for the Minister is whether this review of electoral systems includes a review of the supplementary vote specifically. Will the supplementary vote be included in the review when it comes out later this year? It is good to hear that that will happen later this year.</p>

<ul>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07071053000003"></a>The noble Baroness said: I will also speak to Amendments Nos. 113A and 125. This group, which also contains Amendments Nos. 121A and 126, covers two separate issues. I apologise to the Committee if I have contributed to the muddle&#151;there was an attempt at degrouping last night, which does not seem to have stuck. Some of issues were over whether one of the amendments was acceptable, but I do not think that that should prevent us from debating the principles involved.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07071053000004"></a>The first of the two issues is whether an authority should have complete flexibility and a complete menu of choice in the arrangements that it puts in place to undertake and discharge its functions. Our Benches think that it should. Earlier in Committee, my noble friend Lady Scott referred to Henry Ford saying, &#147;Any model as long as it&#146;s black&#148;. To continue the analogy, there are one or two different models here, but not the whole range of vehicles. We believe that local authorities should have the choice. The Government talk a great deal about freedoms and flexibilities and about devolving decisions and so on. In short, why do the Government feel the need to prescribe?</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07071053000005"></a>The second issue is about what the 2000 Act calls &#147;alternative arrangements&#148;. I find that terminology bizarre, because those arrangements were the norm; when they became characterised as &#147;alternative&#148;, that in some way debased and devalued them. It is only so-called small councils, serving populations of fewer than 85,000, that have been entitled to operate the so-called alternative arrangements, which are closer to the old committee system than the executive/scrutiny model. In practice, these arrangements are not now quite the same as the old committee system. Why are the Government so intent on blocking that system? What is the problem? I have not heard any arguments for the structure itself being inherently faulty. I do not recall hearing arguments at the time of the 2000 Act that it was such a bad structure that it should be restricted to small councils. Ensuring that small councils need not go through the upheaval of creating an executive/scrutiny split and enabling them to continue in their old ways was something of a concession. However, it is becoming the accepted wisdom that those old ways have something wrong with them.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07071053000006"></a>In the debates in the Commons committee, the Minister talked about the &#147;devolutionary and pragmatic approach&#148; taken in 2000. As far as I can see, he did not argue why that was right or wrong then or whether it was something that the Government gave in to. As I was very much involved, I happen to know that the figure of 85,000 was the subject of some trading between the Government and these Benches; we got it up from the original figure to increase choice at local authority level. A lot of what we have heard is not argument but assertion. I hope that tonight we hear argument&#151;about the merits or demerits of that system and of giving local authorities greater choice than the Government seem prepared to accept&#151;not simply assertion, which has tended to be the case in a number

Ministers have said, &#147;We don&#146;t agree with the noble Lord because we don&#146;t agree&#148;, instead of taking us through all the arguments and enabling us to understand how the Government arrived at their conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07071053000007"></a>Of the other amendments in the group, we might have tabled Amendment No. 125 as a consequential amendment. However, this is now one of those God and Robert Browning moments. Browning is said to have said, &#147;When I wrote this, God and I knew what it meant. Now only God knows&#148;. If the Minister feels that it is difficult to respond, I will have considerable sympathy. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="07071053000008"></a><b><a name="70710-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071053000028"></a>Baroness Scott of Needham Market:</b> I support my noble friend Lady Hamwee in her attempt to introduce more flexibility and choice in the models of governance available to local authorities. I want to make a number of points. The experience of the last few years has shown no particular appetite among the public for the elected mayoral model, which suggests that the general public are wary of the prospect of the concentration of power in the hands of one individual. The public are being rather wiser than the Government. Certainly until now the majority of referendums held on the mayoral model have resulted in no support for a mayor.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07071053000009"></a>There are some practical difficulties, which are not insurmountable, but about which the Government need to think carefully before going too far down the road of forcing local authorities to choose the mayoral model. There is a real possibility that in many areas, at the time of election, there might be a particularly contentious local issue&#151;it might be not even council related, but something like a hospital closure. A mayor might get elected on the back of a single-issue campaign. There is nothing wrong with that, except that under this model that person will then have complete control of the local authority, with a budget of many millions of pounds, and yet might well have had almost nothing at all to say about other council services.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07071053000010"></a>Nor is there any evidence of a great groundswell of support for mayors once the referendum has decided that there will be a mayor. My noble friend Lord Greaves, speaking to an earlier amendment, referred to the situation in Torbay. There the turnout for the mayoral election was 24 per cent, and there were 14 candidates. The level of popular support for the winning candidate&#151;for the person who exercises all this executive authority in that area&#151;was very low indeed. The Government need to understand that someone is not a strong leader because they or the Government say that they are a strong leader; they are a strong leader partly because of the way in which they govern in their area, but also partly because they have a level of popular support. With the low turnout and all the problems that we have heard about from my noble friend Lord Greaves about how the supplementary vote system works, there is a real problem for people identifying with the mayor.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07071053000011"></a>I urge the Government not to get too carried away with the London example, because London is not typical. Around the country, there are few figures as prominent and well known as Ken Livingstone is  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1335"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>here. The political realities and the cultures of local authorities vary enormously across the country and reflect the history of the area. A wider range of leadership models enables councils to choose a model that better suits their culture, ethos and tradition.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07071053000012"></a>Another practical difficulty worries me, to which I hope the Government have given some thought. Under the old committee system in particular, people rose through the ranks, in effect. They chaired sub-committees and then they chaired major committees or held cabinet positions. All those jobs provided testing grounds for them where they learnt their craft and where colleagues and the public could decide whether or not they were suitable people. Under the new system it is difficult to see where the mayors of tomorrow will come from. Where will they get their experience when there are no other executive positions on offer?</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07071053000013"></a>I strongly support my noble friend Lady Hamwee in saying that there is no evidence from past performance that the leadership models impact directly on the quality of local government produced. In recent years, central government has thrown a raft of inspection regimes at local government, all of which have shown an improvement across the board, with no evidence to link that to the style of governance. I could be cruel and point out that the governance model chosen for Stoke-on-Trent&#146;s council resulted in its performance plummeting.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07071053000014"></a>I support the amendment and urge the Government, if they really want to be taken seriously on devolution, to give local authorities more choice over the single most important issue facing them&#151;their style of governance. If the Government are not prepared to let go and give local government that choice, I am afraid that all their words on devolution will be seen as meaningless rhetoric.</p>

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="07071053000015"></a><b><a name="70710-0009.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07071053000029"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> Amendment No. 121A in the group seeks to do very much the same as the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee&#151;to restore to local government, if it wishes, the possibility of a committee system. That is ruled out by the Local Government Act 2000, except in local authorities with populations of 85,000 or under. Neither of the Ministers was here at that time, but I assure them that it was a very hard-fought battle that ended up with a limit of 85,000&#151;no more than that&#151;for local authorities to be allowed to maintain their committee system.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07071053000016"></a>It would be a flight of fancy if anyone believed that the cabinet model or the elected mayor model worked to the benefit of all councillors. It is of enormous importance to people in the cabinet, who now earn enormous sums of money for being there&#151;rightly, in view of their extra responsibility. But to think that overview and scrutiny is the perfect role for ward councillors who are not in the cabinet or not associated with it would, frankly, not be exact. It is not a great job and it carries with it no power of decision. Many people elected to local government believe that they will go in with an ability to influence decision-making.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07071053000017"></a>Practically all overview and scrutiny is retrospective. In my local authority, there is a very short timescale for calling in a decision before it is made. That is one  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1336"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1336</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>way of looking at a decision, but the decision is in the hands of either the cabinet member&#151;as is mostly the case&#151;or the cabinet. A back-bencher&#146;s role in that is limited. It is also true that decisions are not scrutinised before they are made to anything like the same extent as previously. People used to deride the committee system and say, &#147;Oh, it was only a rubber stamp&#148;, but I can remember many occasions when it looked as if committee decisions were about to go through but came under very sharp scrutiny from back-bench members who knew exactly what they were talking about and who could make a committee chairman extremely uncomfortable because he had not taken into account a lot of the detail.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07071053000018"></a>I do not imagine that all local authorities would want to go back to a committee and sub-committee system. I do not imagine that they would necessarily want to adapt an executive to have a supporting committee system. But why should local authorities not have the option of doing that? Why should they not have the option of making sure that their back-benchers are included in a way that is satisfactory to them? We are going around in hoops and loops trying to make sure that this has happened. The right to call in decisions will do something simply to rectify what cannot happen under the present system of bringing matters forward. One was always able to do it, but now it is not possible and we have to have different ways of doing it.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07071053000019"></a>There are many structures and we need to look at all of them. This structure was denigrated and ruled out at the time. We should expand our systems of administration to allow the committee and sub-committee system to come back as part of the arrangements that local authorities are allowed to adopt.</p>

I have never hidden the fact that I am a yesterday&#146;s man in terms of involvement in local government. I attend my party meetings and I meet my local councillors, who all have my respect. We are reflecting on whether the existing system is working. Colleagues involved in it are telling me that it does not. As an observer of the situation, I have no evidence that it does not.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07071053000021"></a>I realise that there are two tiers of councillors&#151;those who are at the top table and those who are not&#151;but my knowledge of my local councils is that those councillors who are not at the top table are keen to get there. They have opportunities of demonstrating to their colleagues that they are able or more able to serve at the top table, because that is where the power lies. The breadth of change, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, referred, is that those who have cabinet responsibility have been remunerated considerably. I come from an era when I did not get a penny. I soldiered on, always thinking that I ought to get a penny, but I never did. I have no hang-up regarding those who carry responsibilities of not only taking decisions but defending them afterwards being paid for that. That is the way that the system works here&#151;people who have responsibility are paid for it and are answerable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07071053000022"></a>The thrust of the Bill from the beginning has been to try not only to elevate the concept of leadership, with a capital &#147;L&#148;, in relation to the mayor, the leader or the chairman, but to change the atmosphere and the environment of leadership. We can all think back over previous years when there was a good man or woman in local government who, in the first instance, had the respect of their colleagues and, in the second instance, demonstrated their abilities to the public.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07071053000023"></a>On balance, I am in favour of trying to ensure that there is powerful leadership in the council. That does not mean that people who do not have ebullient personalities are debarred from leadership, because quality of leadership comes in many shapes and sizes. It is not always the best speaker or debater who is the best leader, because the leader not only has to speak, but also has to weld the team together, create the best policies and be the best public relations man or woman.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07071053000024"></a>The system that we have in existence, for good or ill, is still at a very early stage&#151;only six or seven years in. I do not detect a groundswell among councillors, and certainly not among members of the Labour Party, that there is something inherently wrong in the present system, but I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say, because she will be equipped not only with a point of view, but with experience and evidence to back it up.</p>

Nobody is suggesting going back to the old systems in every detail. What we are suggesting is a system based on committees or a hybrid system. There is no reason why a hybrid executive and committee system cannot work. Indeed, many councils have one because they have area committees which take quite a lot of executive decisions. That is allowed under Section 18 of the 2000 Act. We will discuss that when we reach later amendments.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07071061000002"></a>It does not matter whether there is a groundswell across the country. The important thing in a devolutionary era is whether people in an authority feel strongly that they want to change the system and have the ability to change it in the way that they think will deliver the best local government. The Government sometimes talk as though they are the ones advocating good community leadership, efficient councils, good delivery of services and lots of local vision and everyone else is going back to the 19th century. There was plenty of local vision in the 19th century. It is simply a question of there being different ways of achieving the same things. Why should people on the ground in their own councils not make those decisions? We have heard so much devolutionary rhetoric but now that we are getting onto some major issues, the devolutionary rhetoric seems to be scuttling away under the floorboards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07071061000003"></a>We will discuss the role of councillors later so I will not go into that now. When the word &#147;committee&#148; is raised, people talk about horses and camels&#151;a camel being a horse designed by a committee. That may be true but what are committees for? Nobody would employ a committee to design a new house or&#151;I was going to say transport system but perhaps that is wrong. Design is something best done by professionals who go away and do it. Then it comes back and, like the Olympic logo, you say, &#147;Yes, this is wonderful&#148; or, &#147;This is a load of rubbish&#148;. If you are sensible and it is a load of rubbish, you kick it out. That is how good design is done. You would not employ a committee to design a horse. Let us look at some other analogies. What is a donkey? A donkey is a horse designed by bureaucrats. What is an elephant? An elephant is a horse designed by self-important leaders. What is a giraffe? A giraffe is a horse designed by policy wonks in Downing Street.</p>

<a name="70710-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07071061000004"></a>Take that as you wish, but what are committees good at? Committees are good at discussion. We are in Committee now and we are discussing things. It is far easier to involve members of the public in council decisions if you have good functioning committees because there is a forum where people can take part in the discussion. If they are run properly, are efficient and are given or develop choices, they are actually quite good at making decisions, particularly at local level where they are acting on behalf of the community. Nobody ever agrees on everything&#151;there are always different interests and different points of view&#151;but a good functioning representative committee can make the decision in open session in public. People may not like it, but at least they are able to come along, listen, take part and see that decisions are being taken democratically. If decisions are made by one person, how on earth does that process happen? If there are single-party executives on councils&#151;I have to point out that I am a member of one&#151;it is not satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07071061000005"></a>I am, for my sins, the executive member for housing market renewal in Pendle. As part of the housing market renewal pathfinder, the council gets about &#163;9 million a year to invest in the area, which is a lot of money for an ordinary, small district council, so we wanted an executive member who was responsible for it. I said that I would do it, but only on the condition that I could have a committee. I now chair the housing market renewal committee. People can come along to the forum. If they do not like our decisions, they come and shout at us. When we have real choices to make, people come and tell us what they think. It is all done in public and the debates are reported in the local newspapers. This year, I have even insisted that we have members of the opposition groups on the committee. That is the scrutiny element of committees that the noble Baroness spoke about, which is so important.</p>

In some places it worked very well and in others&#151;such as Lancashire County Council, of which I used to be a member&#151;it was not all that good. But a huge amount of scrutiny took place. That was the function. Far better scrutiny took place under that old system than takes place in the artificial, manufactured way in which overview and scrutiny committees work nowadays.</p>

I am grateful for all the contributions.

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07071061000009"></a>Clause 62 provides for changes to the executive arrangements that local authorities in England can adopt. It does that by amending Section 11 of the Local Government Act 2000. The three executive models that we propose will be set out in the Bill. I hope to meet the challenge that the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, raised about providing evidence, not assertion, on why leadership is important and why we have chosen this route.</p>

Briefly, as I understand it, it seeks to preserve for England the option of all members of the executive being elected to the council, but I shall have a slightly longer answer to give on that. I shall not reiterate what the amendments seek to achieve but will move on to the debate about the system of governance that we are proposing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07071061000012"></a>The first thing that we can all agree on is that the challenges facing local councils are different from what they were five or 10 years ago. It is not just that the pressures are intensifying or that resources have to be spread wider. As was summed up in the Lyons report, councils are no longer just agents of service delivery. What Lyons said, and what the councils themselves are saying, is that there is more to the local council than simply ensuring that schools are good, hospitals thrive and the streets are clean. It is not just about meeting new challenges that we could not have envisaged 10 years ago, such as climate change, mitigation and anticipation, and all the changes that they imply, or the pressures of ageing. It is about the role of the council in envisaging and developing the shape of the place. It is a good phrase because, although it is slightly elliptical, we all know what the making and shaping of a place means. It is a broader vision that requires different sorts of leadership. In order to underpin this change of culture, about which my noble friend who is not in his place was talking and which we set

I shall come to that shortly.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07071061000013"></a>As we stated in our White Paper:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="07071061000027"></a>&#147;Places need clear vision and strong leadership to deal with constantly changing economic, social, environmental, and cohesion challenges&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071061000026"></a>The <I>New Council Constitutions:</I><I>Findings from the 2005 ELG Sample Survey</I> showed that the arrangements that were introduced by the 2000 Act support visible and effective leadership. It was an independent report that was updated in June. It showed that since 2000 there have been changes. Councils have taken on the new freedoms. There are three sets of new freedoms. Some have taken on all of them and others have made cautious progress. Nevertheless, there has been a shift towards more concentrated leadership. The final report of the <I>Long-term Evaluation of the Best Value Regime</I> showed clearly that leadership is the most significant driver of change and improvement in local authorities.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07071061000014"></a>That is one set of evidence, but we also have another very recent set of evidence. At Second Reading, we published a report, <I>Does Leadership Matter?</I> It was a thorough academic report undertaken by the same research team led by Professor Gerry Stoker. The evidence is very comprehensive but it boils down to this:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="07071061000028"></a>&#147;There is general agreement that the aim of enhancing effective leadership has been met and that the new executive arrangements have bedded down well, thus providing more visible and effective leadership and quicker decision-making which is in turn associated with better service delivery ... Taken together, our findings show a consistent relationship between on the one hand, authorities with a stable political leadership and authorities that have over a period of time given the full range of powers to their leaders and, on the other hand a better service performance and greater citizen satisfaction&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70710-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07071061000015"></a>On the one hand we have the challenge of doing things differently because we need to, but we also have the evidence that building on what came in 2000 is a movement for a greater concentration of power. That is the direction of travel and the evidence suggests that it is working.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07071061000016"></a>We believe that the key to success in local government is strong and accountable leadership. We have come forward with what we think is necessary. All the surveys of stakeholders, councillors and officials demonstrate four things: the new arrangements show that decision-making is quicker; the role of the leader has become stronger; the leader of the council has a higher public profile; and the council&#146;s relations with partners have improved.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07071061000017"></a>We are in no way pushing the mayoral model to the exclusion of the other three set out in Clause 62, but the mayoral models are perceived to be out-performing the non-mayoral authorities when it comes to effective local leadership. They get higher marks across a whole series of criteria. They also get higher overall approval ratings. More than 50 per cent of councillors and nearly 75 per cent of officers also believe that under the new arrangements the executive has become more effective in articulating a vision.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07071061000018"></a>I would not dispute that the best leaders can be successful in any system, but the executive governance arrangements that we have set out are most likely to

I think that we have reached a point in local government history and in national and local government where we need to take more decisive steps, which is what the Bill will bring about.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07071061000019"></a>Noble Lords have spoken with great eloquence, but with a little scepticism too, about the old committee system. It found few friends. Even Simon Milton has been quoted as being critical of the system and saying we would not want to return to it. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said that it was not perfect. From reading the deliberations in another place and from what people said, it was virtually invisible to most people. Nobody knew who were on these committees. When I was working in the voluntary sector it was extremely hard to find out who one should approach and how, or what the process was.</p>

She was one of the best-known politicians in the county; she had a presence and was highly respected throughout the county. I give that as one extremely good example, but what the Minister is saying is not actually true.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07071061000022"></a>Very few people knew what the remit of the committees was. In the other place, a whole raft of arguments was given from first hand experience about the obstructive nature of some of the committees and the obscure nature of some of the work. I do not want to denigrate the committees, nor, God forbid, the people who served on them, because they worked very well over many years. But the 2000 Act recognised that things had to change. The noble Lord seemed to suggest that they worked better for smaller authorities&#151;the fewer than 85,000&#151;than for larger authorities where there was a bigger challenge. We began to explore the tension between leadership and scrutiny. That is the balance expressed in the White Paper and the Bill. Yes, we have to have stronger leadership, but we also have to have greater powers of scrutiny. This is an opportunity for the ward councillors now to develop their own profile in a way that has not been possible before. We shall come to the role of the overview and scrutiny committees and the community calls for action, and so on.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07071061000023"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said that the committee system brought on trained people but I fail to see why that cannot be developed under the existing and future system. Many of the overview and scrutiny committees themselves are turning into policy and development committees as they review the work of the council. As my noble friend said, it feeds ambition.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07071061000024"></a>In the three models that we have set out&#151;the leader and cabinet executive, the mayor and cabinet executive, and an elected executive&#151;we are allowing for choice, but within a set of principles that say that we require

That is required in modern local government and that is where the strength lies. This is an area on which we disagree, but I hope that we can tease out some of these issues during our deliberations.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07071061000025"></a>I turn briefly to Amendment No. 125, which seeks to preserve the option of a council being able to elect all the members of the executive. As we have previously discussed, the new leader and the cabinet model, which the Bill introduces, removes that option. In future the cabinet will be appointed by the leader. We shall debate that on the next amendment. In this way, as I have explained, we think that coherent and stable leadership is more easily created.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07071067000001"></a>Noble Lords might have asked why Welsh authorities appear to retain the option of electing their leadership group&#151;I know that I am giving the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, even more ammunition for a future exchange. Clauses 62 and 63 seek to modify the 2000 Act provisions in relation to English authorities but we intend to leave unchanged the detailed provision in relation to Wales, as that is obviously a matter for the Welsh Assembly and the Welsh Government.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07071067000002"></a>While I suspect that we may not agree, I hope that, with that statement of principle, I have been able to provide at least more than an assertion of why we are doing what we are.</p>

<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="07071067000003"></a><b><a name="70710-0010.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071067000087"></a>Baroness Scott of Needham Market:</b> I thank the noble Baroness and wish to continue the debate with a few further points. First, I want to put on record that no one on these Benches is suggesting that leadership is not important. As someone who worked for some years undertaking assessments of councils for the Audit Commission, I was always absolutely clear that the highest performing councils were those with the most effective leadership.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07071067000004"></a>The point at issue is that the 2000 Act brought in some changes to the governance of councils. My own council at the time, Suffolk County Council, made an early move away from the committee system towards a cabinet style because we felt it a better system of governance. At that stage, it was our decision to make, based on our assessment of what was best for our area.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07071067000005"></a>That philosophical point underpins the fundamental problem that the Liberal Democrats have with the Government&#146;s position. The Government say that the various challenges faced by local authorities are so dreadful that they absolutely must have strong leaders&#151;super-people, who will appear to lead councils and sail through all the challenges&#151;but that none of those people can be trusted to decide how their own areas should be governed; they can only have a range of options from central government. The Government seem to have a Janus-type attitude, saying on the one hand, &#147;We want strong, powerful councils&#148; and, on the other, &#147;You are not sensible enough to choose your own model of governance&#148;.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07071067000006"></a>If some systems of governance have clearly better outcomes than others, councils will move to those themselves having seen the benefits. They should not

It is difficult for the Government to say to local councils, on the one hand, &#147;We trust you and want you to be strong&#148;, and on the other, &#147;We do not trust you enough to decide how you run your own affairs&#148;.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Graham, suggested that I wrote down &#147;Too soon to change&#148;, and then I wrote &#147;Exactly!&#148;&#151; for the benefit of <I>Hansard</I>, there is an exclamation mark after that.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07071067000008"></a>My noble friend Lady Scott has made the point well that effective leadership is not the same as so-called strong leadership. Leadership can be shown not merely through the Government&#146;s formal leadership models; there were some good examples of it under the old style. We are told that the new models will help with&#151;it is so full of jargon&#151;place-shaping. The noble Baroness&#146;s description of that as moving away from local administration of services dictated centrally made me think, &#147;Yes, that was what we had before there was so much dictation from the centre&#148;. I agree with her analysis that there is a problem there, although not with her solution.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07071067000009"></a>As my noble friends and others have said, there is further debate to be had on the role of the ward councillor, so I wish to make only one further comment. It was suggested that, currently, where a strong leader is identified, the council&#146;s relations with its partners have been improved. I find that a curious concept. If relationships with partners depend on there being an individual to whom they can relate, that is a poor state of affairs when we are talking about public services. As I say, I am sure that we will come back to this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07071067000010"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness for explaining my Amendment No. 125. I knew that I had a good reason for tabling it. I was confused when I looked at it again today and thought, &#147;Aren&#146;t we letting the Welsh do their own thing?&#148;. That would be the right thing to do, but my analysis of it in the first instance was better than I had realised. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The idea is that the whole council will not be able to choose the members of its executive or cabinet body&#151;I hesitate to use the word &#147;committee&#148;, but I do not know what executives are, if not committees&#151;and will only be able to appoint a leader, who will then appoint the members of the executive. Some councils may do that at the moment under the 2000 Act, or they can elect the executive, probably at their annual meeting.</p>

<a name="70710-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07071067000016"></a>I do not know of any council with the model that the Government suggest. I am sure there are plenty, but they are perhaps not councils that I know about, which would suggest that they are not ordinary district councils. Most of the councils that I know about around the country, where I have colleagues with whom I communicate quite frequently, tend to be district councils or metropolitan district councils. People will be astonished at the idea that a council&#146;s constitution cannot provide for a system in which the executive&#151;by far the most important body in the council now&#151;is appointed or elected at the annual meeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07071067000017"></a>When this was discussed in Committee in the House of Commons, there was some fascinating debate. The then local government Minister, Mr Woolas, a Nelsonian gone to other pastures, said&#151;and I paraphrase him&#151;&#147;Well, it does not really matter, because councillors will get round it anyway, won&#146;t they?&#148; That is, they will come to their own arrangements, and things will carry on much as before, which may be the case. In my council, if we had a model where the leader appoints the executive, the leader would be appointed only on the terms that the executive is agreed by a much wider group of people than himself or herself. That is how a lot of councils will work; many get round what they saw as restrictions in the 2000 Act arrangements in such a way. They are probably making themselves more efficient and approachable, and better councils with better leadership, as a result. This will be regarded as an absolutely astonishing provision. People will think that the Government and this Parliament have gone mad if it goes through. I beg to move.</p>

The 2006 census of local councils showed that 41 per cent of those with the leader and cabinet model had adopted the approach proposed in the Bill; in other words, the leader appoints the cabinet in only 41 per cent of councils operating that system. That means that 59 per cent have a model that will be outlawed by this Bill. Again, that runs counter to all the devolutionary rhetoric of the Government. The Minster has talked about how much local government has improved under the new models. Since the majority are operating this system, it is difficult to see why the Government want to get rid of it. It is hard to see their rationale.</p>

Furthermore, the provision will be seen as a nail in the coffin of the back-benchers who, as we have heard and will continue to hear, feel disempowered by successive government policies.

I come from an authority where the leader appoints the cabinet. There is quite a lot to be said for the fact that a leader who has been elected by the council should then be able to pick those whom they believe will do the job best. I accept that it is possible under an election system within a council for people to stand, be put forward and voted on. However, a leader must have confidence in the people with whom he or she serves. There are enormous advantages in being able to say to your colleagues, &#147;I would like you to be part and parcel of this team&#148;. It is ultimately a team. If the team does not work, and there are scratchy issues because somebody has been elected into it&#151;forced in by other colleagues, as it were&#151;there can be difficulties in how it operates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07071067000021"></a>I said that I was only half supporting the amendment, but there is probably a rationale for saying, &#147;If you don&#146;t want to do it that way, don&#146;t&#148;. You can have another way of doing it, and the authority can elect a cabinet as it elects the leader. I understand that that is what the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is doing, and see some sense in people having an alternative. My own preference would be to leave it as the Government have.</p>

I was going to quote her outstanding example of Kensington and Chelsea as having a leader who elects the team. As we all know, her colleague the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, runs the council of a county the size of a small developing nation, and it has this same model. So, although the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, says that it is astonishing that we brought this provision forward, I do not think that it is. Indeed, 41 per cent of councils having followed this model is a significant number; I was going to quote that statistic myself. Across the Chamber, we will have disagreements on principle, but much of the logic of what we are trying to do will follow from Clause 62.</p>

Leadership does not happen by accident, and part of the logic we are faced with in this part of the Bill is that of building visibility and accountability&#151;building what the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, called the team&#151;so that people know who is taking the decisions and why they have chosen their routes across the different services, or whatever. I obviously cannot agree with the amendment, although I understand the spirit in which it is moved. However, in all the ways in which we have set out the notion of strong and prosperous communities, we have always explained why we would change the status quo and

This is one of the three freedoms identified in the research that I spoke of earlier. It is to enhance the effectiveness, coherence and collectivity of the leadership that they will be visible across the local area and, in so doing, encourage better leadership.</p>

However, it also shows that it is possible to grow leadership in different ways. Another piece of evidence I would like to refer to is the conclusions of the report on the state of English cities, published in 2006. That evidence shows that entrepreneurial leadership is absolutely crucial to finding new economic futures for cities, businesses and residents. All that inclines us towards thinking that we must have a more predictable system which plays to and identifies strengths. Enabling the council leader to build a team is the right way to go.</p>

My understanding of the current system is that it is perfectly possible for leaders to operate the system now proposed. They do not need this legislation to do it. A council currently has a choice between a model in which the cabinet is elected by the council and one where it is chosen by the leader. I make no judgments about the relative merits of those two systems; for me, the important thing is that the choice remains. We have a problem with the removal of that choice under the Bill.</p>

I was being provocative, but there is an assumption throughout that, when the Government say &#147;strong leadership&#148;, that is what matters, as though opponents are not in favour of good leadership. We ought to be talking about the nature of leadership, and the Government&#146;s view is oversimplified, to put it fairly simply. We are not talking about strong or weak leadership, but good and better leadership. If that is what the Government mean by strong leadership, they must understand that there are different ways of doing that. Different ways

For the Labour Party, of all bodies, to appear to dismiss the concept of collective leadership is an astonishing ideological U-turn that I do not subscribe to. It is perfectly possible to have consensual leadership, co-operative leadership, collective leadership or collegiate leadership and for it to be very good leadership indeed. If it works really well, it is better than having leadership by one person. The noble Baroness talked about entrepreneurial leadership. I keep trying to avoid talking about Pendle, but a good example of entrepreneurial leadership is the council&#146;s incredibly quick decisions to invest in new buildings in the middle of Nelson as a joint venture with a local company.</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07071067000031"></a>That must be my phone. I beg the Committee&#146;s pardon. It must be somebody from Pendle ringing to say, &#147;Come on, get on with it&#148;. If I can find out how to operate this thing&#151;this is hopeless; I should curl up and die. There, I&#146;ve switched it off. I apologise.</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07071067000032"></a>I shall say two more things. I agree that leadership does not happen by accident, but nor does it happen by imposing structures. It happens by good people getting into leadership positions and working together to make the structure work. Any structure that is adopted will have advantages and disadvantages, yet it has to work. I fear that the structures that the Government are proposing will be quite brittle when things get to crisis point.</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07071067000033"></a>My second point relates specifically to this amendment. It is okay if there is a group in overall control and it appoints the leader, who is elected by the council. The leader will probably appoint the people who have been negotiating within the group by one means or other. That will work. In a council with no overall control, as is often the case, that approach does not work quite so well. Who is on the executive will be a matter of negotiation between two or more of the parties on the council. That is underpinned by the numbers on the council and by who sticks their hands up to vote. If that decision is taken away and put in the hands of one person, particularly if that person will be there for four years, everything can break down fairly quickly and a series of crises might result, because the system is not resilient or flexible enough to cope. I ask the Government to look at that. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It seems that it was given the advice that it was rather difficult and the Government had not thought it out, so the idea got stuck in this Bill to set out a perhaps more coherent, and certainly more comprehensive, model of how we might have an elected executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07071067000037"></a>Amendment No. 115 is one of a number of amendments I have tabled to try to remove all the references to elected executives from the Bill. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, who found even more references than I did and has helped to produce a thorough list of things that need filleting out of the Bill. No doubt there are others that we have missed. The principle is that we would like to remove the references to an elected executive being a model because it is, frankly, daft. We can talk about the details of the Bill, but this is a matter where we have to say that the proposal being put forward is simply silly.</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07071067000038"></a>What is it? It is a proposal that a group of people, a political party or any other group of people can put forward for election across an authority a slate consisting of a proposed leader and a number of other members of the executive. As I understand it, between three and 10 people would stand for election and, having been elected, would form the leader and executive of the council. I think they would be councillors, although I am not very certain because the Bill states that the Government may make regulations to what extent they will be councillors. Presumably they will be councillors and will be called Councillor Bloggs or Councillor Ali or whatever. They will be elected across the district, so they will not represent wards. They will have no direct link of the kind that the noble Baroness was talking about, which is the link between a councillor and the people who regard him as their councillor and go to him when they have a problem or something to say. We all think that is important in whatever electoral system we want.</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07071067000039"></a>Who wants it? It is rumoured that Stockton-on-Tees may want it, or perhaps one or two leadership people in Stockton may want it, but it is not clear who else does. According to the report on the Public Bill Committee in the House of Commons, when the witnesses from the LGA were giving evidence they were asked where the demand came from and who put it forward. It is reported that the witnesses looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. They did not know, so it does not seem to have come from representatives of local government.</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07071067000040"></a>What effect would it have on the council? It would have all sorts of effects. There would be two kinds of councillors, so the problems that we have in the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly with the additional member system would be repeated and would probably be much worse. The divisions that exist in many councils at the moment between executive and Cabinet councillors and back-benchers would inevitably be exacerbated because there would

It could unbalance the numbers&#151;although the extent to which it would do that is not very clear&#151;and produce a council that is not representative. If people voted differently or if there was a close vote under the supplementary vote system a slate could get in with perhaps only 35 per cent of the vote across the borough, whereas in individual ward elections quite different people might be elected because the votes would pile up in individual wards rather than being spread across the authority. There are all sorts of questions to be asked about electoral systems, and we will come on to them. </p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07071067000041"></a>Finally, there is stand part on Clause 67. Clause 67, which is printed on pages 42 and 43 of the Bill, sets out in great detail how the executive will be elected. When the debates took place in the House of Commons, a number of people&#151;my honourable friend Andrew Stunell was particularly prominent&#151;pooh-poohed the idea that the size of the executive had to be fixed before the elections took place. The argument was that people might well have a choice of a small executive of three or four full-time people or a big executive of perhaps 10 people who would be part-time and would operate in a very different way, and that that choice could be put before the people.</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07071067000042"></a>The Government responded to that, and we now have the extraordinary stuff on pages 42 and 43 about the different kinds of election there might be. It is not that there will be a choice of the people standing, but that the council will decide whether it has to be a definite number of people, can be a number of people,</p>
<ul><a name="07071067000082"></a>&#147;the same as, or greater than, the specified minimum membership, but ... must not be greater than the specified maximum membership&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071067000043"></a>or,</p>
<ul><a name="07071067000083"></a>&#147;must be 3 or more&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071067000079"></a>The whole system is a muddle and quite extraordinarily complex. Few people if any are going to take part in it&#151;there might be two or three councils putting themselves forward as pioneers but my guess is that they will come scuttling back like Stoke-on-Trent, saying, &#147;The Government got it wrong. Can it be unscrambled?&#148;.</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07071067000044"></a>I hope this House might take these provisions out before the Bill goes back to the Commons, and ask the Government to seriously think again about what is an incredibly flawed proposal. We are not there yet&#151;we are in Committee, discussing it in detail&#151;and on that basis I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply and what she can possibly say to justify this extraordinary nonsense. I do not want to blame her for it, but she has to defend it. I look forward to the debate. On that basis, I beg to move.</p>

Amendments Nos. 168 and 169 cancel out the references to an elected executive in new Section 40D. Clause 76 provides for supplementary provision for the dates of the years of the election of mayors and executive members, and the amendments would remove that as well.</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07071067000047"></a>The arguments against an elected executive are manifold. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has laid out a number of them. The questions that arise from this are also extensive. First, where in the world has a system such as this been used before? Secondly, how will this elected executive be supernumerary to the council? That is what it looks as if it will be under new Section 40C. Thirdly, how can councillors be elected to an elected executive if they have not been elected? Presumably the elected executives have to be elected at the same time as the elections. Do you stand as both an elected executive member and a councillor, or can you stand for just one? If, as I understand it, you stand as both a councillor and a member of the elected executive and you are then elected, do you have to then stand down as a councillor? If so, a by-election is caused.</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07071067000048"></a>Where on earth does this get us? It presupposes that there are insufficient people on the council suitable to be senior executives on that council. What does that say of the confidence that people have in their council and councillors? Why should local authorities be hoicking around trying to find people suitable to run education, housing or finance who cannot be found from within the council? That is what it amounts to. You will have to find specific people to adopt specific roles and then try to have them elected on a slate. What happens if you then want to extend that executive? As it is, you have to go with a certain number to have them elected. If anyone is subsequently appointed to the Cabinet, does that leave them as second-class citizens because they were not elected as a member of the executive?</p>

<a name="70710-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07071067000049"></a>It is the most extraordinary proposal I have seen. I have not seen any justification for it, nor have I heard through my local government networks any support for it whatever. Presumably the Government have ideas as to how this should work and what its value would be, yet it is hard to see what that is. My amendments try to ensure that it does not see the light of day.</p>

In the interests of consistency, having argued all the way through Committee for choice, part of me thinks that this should remain on the table so that any local authority daft enough at least has the option to choose it. Since we have been talking about leadership so much tonight, there is a question about the leadership of the Government. By

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07071067000051"></a>I am mystified by the genesis of this option, too. My noble friend Lord Greaves referred to the allegation of Stockton-on-Tees being the birthplace of this. I am mystified as to why some chance remarks by one local authority have led to pages and pages in a Bill, whereas on the previous amendment we were discussing a model which is currently used quite well by 59 per cent of local authorities being thrown out by the Government. I fail to see the logic of the Government&#146;s position on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07071067000052"></a>I must confirm a couple of facts to check that have I understood this correctly. If the leader goes, does the entire slate then go too&#151;so that everyone goes, whether the leader went under a bus or simply became ill or resigned? Does that also apply to each individual member of the slate? What happens if a member of the Cabinet is seen not to be performing well? Does the leader have the option of sacking and replacing them, or do we again have to have a fresh set of elections? Under this model, can members put themselves forward both as members of the slate and as ward councillors? If they are elected to take Cabinet office, will they automatically have to resign immediately from their ward council role, causing an immediate by-election? What is going to happen if, as a result of by-elections, there is a change of political control? These questions highlight just some of the potential flaws in the system.</p>

I can best answer the questions that have been raised if I address the stand part debates, which will enable me to take the Committee briefly through the clauses themselves. Many of the amendments that have been brought forward in the filleting process that has been so expertly and jointly carried out by the parties opposite relate to the same issues and are consequential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07071067000054"></a>This is a new, innovative model. There are international precedents and we should not turn our backs on the experience of the directly elected executives in Switzerland and Portugal. Indeed, it was the Geneva council that inspired our interest in the model. Essentially, this is a new model, which has the potential to deliver visible and accountable leadership. It is very similar to the elected mayor model but powers are put in the hands of a slate. This is not a new concept in British politics; a slate reflects the notion of a team rather than an individual. In this model there is a complete separation of powers between the executive and front-line councillors, which will enhance the competence of the councils to

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07071067000055"></a>Perhaps I may now address the stand part debates. Clause 67 amends the Local Government Act 2000 to provide for the new model. Clauses 69 and 71 are consequential to that and ensure that there are provisions in relation to executive members and the elections to the executive. How will that work? Clause 67 makes provision in relation to elected executives by inserting new Sections 40A to 40C into the 2000 Act. New Section 40A provides for the leader and other members of the elected executive to be elected by all local government electors in the authority&#146;s area. It requires that elections for an elected executive take place on the same day as ordinary council elections, as for elected mayors. Yes, to answer the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, new Section 40A provides that members of the elected executive, once elected, are treated as members of the council for the purposes of enactments to be specified in regulations, subject to all the normal rules of qualification, disqualification and so on, just as with the elected mayors.</p>

That is what the noble Lord was referring to in the table that specifies the different sizes. There is a minimum and a maximum size. In fact, the Local Government Act 2000 determined the maximum size as 10. But where a council specifies the minimum and maximum number for proposed elected executives, it will also be able to specify a minimum number below which the

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07071067000064"></a>New Section 40C allows a person to stand as both a councillor and a member of the proposed executive&#151;that answers the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham&#151;and makes provision as to what should happen in the event of a councillor being returned as a member of the executive. If elected, a vacancy will arise in the office of councillor and it will prompt the need for a by-election. So, yes, if a member of the slate also stands as a ward councillor and is elected as a ward councillor, a by-election will at that point be triggered. It is the same situation as arises when a person is returned at the same time as both an elected mayor and a councillor. Like an elected mayor, an elected executive member will have been elected by all the electors and therefore should act in the interests of the whole council area, not just in the interests of a specific ward or county division. Clauses 69 and 71 are consequential on that.</p>

I hope that the noble Baroness was not suggesting that all the existing councillors who represent wards and divisions in England represent only their wards and their divisions and do not look at the interests of the whole area. That would be outrageous.</p>

In this model, we are making a distinction between the executive, which represents the whole area, and the ward councillor, who represents his ward. Of course the ward councillor will also take an interest in the whole area but, in the executive model, there is a difference in the function of the executive and the ward councillor in that sense.</p>

Surely the vast majority of people who are in executives and in cabinets in local authorities, whatever model it is, represent their ward just as much as they represent the whole area. What are known now as front-line councillors or ward councillors, particularly in regard to their overview and scrutiny functions, are councillors for the whole area. It has always been the case that councillors have different responsibilities; they represent the people who have elected them and they represent the council in the whole area. There is no real conflict in this. The Government are introducing conflicts and tensions that they cannot get rid of at the very heart of local government.</p>

That section provides for other forms of executive models, which we will discuss later. We do not have any plans today for any extra executive models, but the power is there. Finally, Clause 71 inserts into the 2000 Act new Section 42A, which extends the preference voting system to the election of an elected executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07071067000070"></a>The amendments are both significant and consequential. Essentially, Amendments Nos. 122 to 124, 140, 152, 154 to 156, 158, 159, 162, 167 to 169 and 194 are all consequential amendments, for the reason given by the noble Lord. I have explained why we have put this model in place as an option that supports the notion of visible executive leadership in a novel way. Removing the model would remove a choice. The Committee has asked where the model has come from. I have explained that there are some European models but, as the notion of a slate is not new, we also responded to suggestions from Stockton that this model was worth looking at and trying. In order to be inclusive and to offer choice, there was no reason why we should not put it on the face of the Bill as another option.</p>

<a name="70710-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07071067000071"></a>Noble Lords have argued that the processes are unworkable and that it makes no sense to have a system under which, after the election, there might be several by-elections for councillors if candidates on the successful slate also stood as ward councillors. In fact, the system is simply an extension of the 2000 Act, which provides that, if a person stands as both a councillor and an elected mayor, he has to stand down. Again, there is nothing very new about this. We have taken it forward in the notion of an elected executive, elected on a manifesto for the authority as a whole. Everyone aspiring to office will be identified. It provides greater clarity and I believe that the model is entirely compatible with the direct and democratic role of ward councillors.</p>

<a name="70710-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07071070000013"></a>The Government are introducing the amendments to fulfil a commitment given in the other place to extend the Bill to mutual insurers. That in turn has given rise to other issues, such as mutuals in other EEA states, hybridity and the charging powers of the Financial Services Authority, which the amendments also deal with. Finally, the amendments allow the Bill to be extended to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. There was insufficient time to consult the islands&#146; authorities on that during proceedings in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07071070000014"></a>Before moving on to the substantive issues raised by the amendments to Clause 3, I shall briefly remind the Committee about the overall purpose of the Bill. It introduces helpful amendments to building societies legislation in relation to the wholesale funding limit and the position of their members in the event of an insolvency. With regard to today&#146;s debate, the Bill will also make it easier for one type of mutual society to

Mutual insurance companies and equivalent European mutuals will be included as a result of the proposed amendments.</p>

<a name="70710-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07071070000015"></a>The Government welcome this opportunity to update the legislation on building societies and other mutual societies. We are sympathetic to the reforms that are being introduced, particularly as they have the potential to significantly benefit members of mutuals. The Treasury will consult publicly on the secondary legislation that will implement the Bill.</p>
<a name="time_23"></a>

<a name="70710-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07071070000016"></a>I turn to the detail. Clause 3 gives the Treasury the power to modify legislation relating to transfer of business of building societies, friendly societies and industrial and provident societies. I will refer to these together as &#147;mutual societies&#148;. The clause will allow the Treasury to modify the statutory provisions that apply to such transfers, to make them less onerous. That is intended to make it easier for mutual societies to acquire other mutuals and develop group structures. Certain safeguards, such as members&#146; rights and safeguards against demutualisation, will remain in place.</p>

<a name="70710-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07071070000017"></a>In Committee in the other place, the Government gave a commitment to try to extend Clause 3 to mutual insurers by introducing amendments at Third Reading. A mutual insurer could be one of the three types of mutual society, or it could be a Companies Act company or have another legal form. The effect would be that a mutual society could transfer to a subsidiary of a mutual insurer under the new provisions on the same terms as it could transfer to a subsidiary of another mutual society.</p>

<a name="70710-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07071070000018"></a>In the event, it was not possible to introduce amendments at Third Reading, which was held two days after Committee, on 27 April. However, at Third Reading the Government gave a further commitment to consider amendments and, if possible, to table them in your Lordships&#146; House. The second and third amendments fulfil that commitment and I will explain those amendments first.</p>

<a name="70710-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07071070000019"></a>Amendment No. 2 widens the definition of &#147;mutual society&#148; in Clause 3 to include EEA mutual societies. Amendment No. 3 defines &#147;EEA mutual society&#148;, which can be a European co-operative society, a co-operative society in any EEA state or any other type of body specified by the Treasury by order. That definition is wide enough to encompass mutual insurers and, by permitting transfers under the new provisions to a mutual society established in any EEA state, it ensures that there will be no breach of EC law. The power to specify other types of body will be exercised by the affirmative resolution procedure if made in the main order amending the transfer provisions for mutuals, or by the negative resolution procedure if made independently of that order.</p>

<a name="70710-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07071070000020"></a>The effect of the amendments is that modifications made by an order under Clause 3 to the legislation governing transfers of mutual societies will apply in two cases: first, where the transfer is to a subsidiary of one of the three types of domestic mutual society;  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1357"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1357</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>secondly, where the transfer is to a subsidiary of an EEA mutual society. The wide definition of &#147;EEA mutual society&#148; ensures that mutual insurers and other mutual societies in any EEA state wishing to acquire other mutual societies as subsidiaries will be able to benefit from the changes in the same measure as domestic mutual societies. The additional power gives the Treasury the flexibility to specify particular types of mutual society as and when the need arises, which it would not be possible to do in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="70710-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07071070000021"></a>The first amendment standing in my name concerns the procedures applying to an order made under Clause 3, which will amend the provisions in legislation dealing with transfers by the various types of mutual society. As Clause 3 will be extended to EEA mutual societies, an order made under that clause may have effects that are peculiar to a particular mutual and so would, potentially at least, fall to be treated as hybrid under Standing Orders but for this provision. In particular, the order may make provisions as to the rights of members under subsection (2) in consequence of a transfer. Those provisions could include giving members of the transferring mutual membership rights in the holding mutual society, which could affect the constitution of that society. I remind noble Lords that the Clause 3 power uses the affirmative resolution procedure. I beg to move.</p>

I would also like to place on record the appreciation of both Houses for Sir John Butterfill, who was primarily responsible for the Bill, although I should also mention the All-Party Building Societies and Financial Mutuals Group, which is one of the largest all-party groups in Parliament&#151;I have the pleasure of being one of the founder members. We should not forget that 19 million people belong to mutuals throughout the United Kingdom. That is a huge number of people and it demonstrates the importance of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07071070000024"></a>My second question involves dipping into my memory bank&#151;it is nice to see the noble Baroness here, with her experience of Europe. Hybridity is a sensitive area. I remember once, as Chairman of Ways and Means, being in charge of determining whether a Bill was a hybrid. Am I right in assuming that Amendment No. 1 has been included because we are dealing with EEA mutuals? If the Minister is not able to answer me this evening, perhaps he would be kind enough to write to me and place a copy of the letter in the Library. I understand that there might have to be provision to remove any question of hybridity in relation to an EEA mutual society, because that opens the door in

Otherwise, we will be in a situation where others may cite this Bill as opening a Pandora&#146;s box in relation to hybridity. I accept that this is rather a technical area and it may be specific to mutuals, but it relates to an important part of parliamentary procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07071070000025"></a>Having said that, I greatly welcome the amendments. This is possibly one of the most dynamic things to have happened in the financial services world, because we are opening up the possibility of linkage between financial mutuals in the UK and their sister bodies throughout the whole of the EEA. That is greatly to be welcomed.</p>

I said to the Minister just before we started our proceedings that my only question was how the insurance provisions would be dealt with, so I was glad that he answered that in his introductory remarks. When I read the amendments, I could not see how insurance companies were being brought within the provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07071070000027"></a>Following my noble friend&#146;s comments, I have one question about hybridity. Is there any precedent for the new subsection contained in Amendment No. 1? Like my noble friend, I am concerned that we are creating a precedent with this Bill for disregarding hybridity, which is one of the lesser known but important areas of how we regulate our business.</p>

The effect is that a transfer of a mutual society&#146;s business under the modified procedures could be to a UK company or to a body corporate incorporated in any other EEA state, provided that that company or body is controlled by another mutual society. Again, this is intended to reduce the risk of breaching EC law. Under Clause 3 as it stands, a mutual in another EEA state would have to establish a UK company subsidiary in order to benefit from the changes. That could put it at a disadvantage, as it might face more practical difficulties establishing and running a UK company subsidiary than a UK mutual would. The changes ensure that UK and EEA mutual societies wishing to acquire other mutual societies are treated equally on a level playing field. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07071070000044"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment ensures that the FSA has powers to charge fees for any functions conferred on it under the Bill. It extends the FSA&#146;s existing powers to charge fees under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. This is a consequence of extending Clause 3 to mutual insurers and to other EEA mutuals. It will be a precondition of a transfer to a subsidiary of an EEA mutual that safeguards equivalent to those applicable to UK mutuals are in place. Those safeguards will, first, give members of the transferring mutual membership rights in the holding mutual and, secondly, restrict demutualisation of the holding mutual and further transfers of the transferring mutual&#146;s business. In most cases, transfers of business by mutual societies require FSA approval, and transferring mutuals will have to satisfy the FSA that these safeguards are in place. This could be more complex and difficult to demonstrate when the transfer is to a subsidiary of an EEA mutual. As this would result in additional work and, therefore, costs for the FSA, we and the FSA consider it appropriate that its fee-charging powers should be extended. I beg to move.</p>

However, one notes that the FSA is currently running a surplus on its income, all of which has arisen from fees charged from varying transactions. Secondly, many of the mutuals are very small organisations and one encouraging feature of the Bill is that it will allow small and medium-sized mutuals to work together and amalgamate in one way or the other in the UK or across the UK and the EEA. I hope, therefore, that when the FSA comes to provide its fee structure, it will recognise that these are small mutuals, entirely there for the benefit of the membership that has joined together, and that it will not provide for&#151;as it attempted when the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 was passed&#151;a de minimis fee structure. I hope that the Government and the Minister speaking for the Treasury will recognise that this is a different kettle of fish and that while there is to be a fee structure&#151;and it is understood that there has to be one&#151;nevertheless the message will go to the FSA that normal fee structures are not always appropriate to small mutuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07071070000061"></a>House again in Committee on Clause 62, Amendment No. 115.</p>

<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="07071070000062"></a><b><a name="70710-0013.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07071070000148"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to resume the debate on the amendment. It was a good idea to break, because I understand noble Lords&#146; frustration when some of the details of the Bill are not explicable. It is a complex Bill and we are talking about an innovative model. I am happy to explain it and hope that I can answer the questions that have been raised. I shall certainly take advice if I cannot.</p>

<a name="70710-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07071070000063"></a>I shall go into a little more detail on how the model works. The nomination system for slates is the same as is used for mayors. Parties will submit their nomination papers with relevant supporting signatures 19 days before polling. Nominations from corresponding ballot papers will clearly identify the prospective leader and contain between two and nine executive members, as provided for in the council&#146;s constitution.</p>

<a name="70710-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07071070000064"></a>There is a limit of 10 members for such an executive, as laid down in the 2000 Act. The minimum number laid down in the Bill is three. The statutory boundaries of the slate, therefore, are three and 10, but the council can decide to vary them to four and nine. There is definitely scope, therefore, for the elected executive to vary in size, which will govern what triggers by-elections.</p>

<a name="70710-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07071070000065"></a>Voting takes place by the supplementary vote. I am sorry to say that to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, but that is the position. It is the same with mayors. The whole area of the council votes for the slate.</p>

<a name="70710-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07071070000066"></a>The elections will take place at the same time as either whole-council elections or by thirds and halves, but the slate is elected for four years. That is the common thread which goes through the three models.</p>

<a name="70710-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07071070000067"></a>Individuals can stand for election to the slate and for ward councillor. As I have said, if they are elected for both, they have to resign as ward councillor and a by-election is held for the resulting vacancy. It is necessary to allow candidates to stand for both positions; otherwise, there would be hardly be any incentive for those who fail to secure an executive post to stand in the first place. The alternative would be to allow for a dual role, but, as I said, the model creates a sharp distinction between the role of the executive and the role of the ward councillor as scrutineer and challenger.</p>

<a name="70710-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07071070000068"></a>The successful slate can be made up of ratepayers&#151;it can have a ratepayer mayor, for example. Members of the slate will take office for a fixed term of four years, four days following the election. The leader will allocate portfolios and appoint a deputy, who can also have portfolio responsibilities. If the executive leader dies or resigns, a by-election for the whole slate must be called. That is essentially because the slate is branded with the leader: they stand and fall together.</p>

<a name="70710-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07071070000069"></a>If a cabinet member dies or resigns, the executive leader decides whether to hold a by-election or to continue with a smaller executive, subject to the executive remaining above the effective minimum as specified in  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1363"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1363</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the council&#146;s constitution. Perhaps I may explain that in a little more detail. The leader chooses, except in certain circumstances, what happens. The leader can decide to carry on with a smaller executive, or he has to call a by-election where the size of the executive is reduced to below the effective minimum. Therefore, if it is below three, he has to have an executive or if the council has set a non-statutory minimum of four or five, then as soon as it drops below that, it has to have a by-election. That introduces some stability. The detail is set out in Schedule 4. Therefore, there are provisions which are designed to prevent constant turmoil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07071070000070"></a>Local authorities are going to have to consult very widely before they adopt this model and in drawing up the proposals. They will have to consider the extent to which moving towards such a model would secure continuous improvement in the way in which they function. They will have to meet that test. I thought noble Lords might be interested to hear what inspired Stockton-on-Tees to opt to consider this possibility. In its letter to the Secretary of State of December 2005 Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="07071070000121"></a>&#147;We believe that the Directly Elected Executive model potentially has the strengths of providing strong focused leadership, and giving greater legitimacy to borough-wide decision-making ...

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="07071070000122"></a>A Directly Elected Executive offers: direct accountability of decision makers to the electorate; a more generalisable model than the mayoral model; stronger local politicians; creation of a collective, joined-up approach in decision-making; [and] focused community advocates in (potentially) single member ward community councillors&#148;.</p>

As I said, there is scope in the size of the slate&#151;the minimum and maximum&#151;to have points at which by-elections are triggered. Those could be different for each arrangement.</p>

The councillors in the elected-member part of the council and this elected executive on top of it may or may not come from the same party; they may or may not have anything to do with their majority. Will they have a leader of the scrutiny part of the council? Who will actually govern them? If they are not from the same party as the executive, it will be a recipe for complete disaster. A whole raft of elected councillors will feel resentful that they have no hope at all of reaching a cabinet position; that they are very unlikely to be given anything to do other than overview and scrutiny; and that unless they can be persuaded to stand on the slate they will never reach a position of authority within the council. How will this split be dealt with? It could be a very uncomfortable situation.</p>

If the council opts for this it will have to understand what it is doing and collectively make that choice. Those who are committed to the council&#146;s business will have to see this in the round and make a decision accordingly. I do not think that it denies the councillors a role; they will have a very challenging role as back-bench councillors holding the executive to account. I think that this model gives more force to the notion of scrutiny and challenge than some other models do. Their role will be extremely clearly defined. They will also be slightly enhanced ward champions, a very definable and accountable role. So I do not agree with the noble Baroness's dire predictions. Apart from anything else, the matter would have to be worked out in consultation before the decision was taken.</p>

The Minister is eloquent in describing it but I cannot get my head round it at all. As for the idea that ward councillors would in these circumstances have a &#147;challenging&#148; and enjoyable role and act as ward champions, I do not know how it would work. It seems to me that they will just be cut out of everything. There will probably be massive frustration and an inability to do very much at all. However, those are matters that can be discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07071070000080"></a>I have a few questions. First, under this model of the elected executive, who and what body will decide the annual council budget? Secondly, although the noble Baroness explained how the competition between slates of different sizes would work, she did not explain why it was a sensible arrangement where three people might be standing against seven, nine or whatever number of people. I do not understand why that is a sensible arrangement at all or how it will help people better to understand how local government is run. Thirdly, the Minister said that it might be possible not to have by-elections if people were elected to the council through both the ward and the executive and the council size was not very great. In such circumstances, however, would not the ward or wards concerned be a councillor down, which would not be a good idea?</p>

<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="07071070000081"></a><b><a name="70710-0013.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="07071070000156"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> The budget process will be the same as now; the council as a whole will still have charge of it. If the leader presented a budget that the council did not accept, then, as currently happens, the council would have to summon a two-thirds majority to overturn it. That is what happens.</p>

<a name="70710-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07071070000086"></a>Why the variable sizes? Again, it would be up to the council to choose. We have tried to enlarge the scope for the council to make its own choices. You could have two or even three slates of variable sizes, and get different configurations of leaderships and executives, one of which might appeal more to the local electorate than another. You might be able to show that, with four people on the executive, you could focus the work and do it properly. That would be entirely up to the council. It is about allowing scope.</p>

<a name="70710-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07071070000087"></a>On the ward by-election point again, if you are elected on the slate and you stand as a ward councillor and are elected, then you have to stand down as a ward councillor. However, whether there is a by-election depends on the arrangements that the council has made about the size of the executive and the trigger point for those by-elections. Shall I put that in writing for the noble Lord?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07071070000089"></a>I will just ask about this business of slates of different sizes. A slate of four people might say, &#147;Just four of us&#151;we can galvanise, we can get together&#148;. Eight people would say, &#147;No, we represent more of the district or county, so we are a better slate&#148;. Should local elections be about that kind of organisational structure&#151;about which structure of an executive is

Should elections not be about the services that are going to be produced and about differences between the slates or candidates on projects in the area&#151;what people will provide&#151;rather than this rather arid structural thing? We are not going to get people to vote on that, are we?</p>

<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="07071070000090"></a><b><a name="70710-0014.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071070000162"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> The noble Lord and I are at one in thinking that this has to be about better services and better ways of delivering things for people. As I said before, this will be tested against notions of effectiveness and efficiency as well. The point is that the people will decide whether this slate is convincing enough to be elected. They will do that on the basis of what they think would provide better services, not on what they think is a better structural arrangement. He and I are agreed.</p>

<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="07071070000091"></a><b><a name="70710-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071070000163"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I apologise to the noble Baroness and to the Committee&#151;I followed the earlier debate, but maybe my point has already been dealt with and I missed it. I am concerned about the principle of accountability under this model. I admit that my experience was in a county council where there was no overall control. This model may be so inappropriate to that situation that the Minister will say that it would not be acceptable in those circumstances. However, I cannot for the life of me see to whom precisely the executive, under this model, are accountable. Are they accountable to the elected leader? If so, what happens if, during the four years of that leader&#146;s office, there is a change in the whole colour and tenor of the council? Such a change in political control can happen very easily these days, maybe as the result of by-elections. Particularly with low turnouts&#151;incidentally, I think that this will lead to very low turnouts indeed&#151;I do not think that it will be clear what responsibility people will have if elected. That will be at the root of the problems related to this subsection.</p>

<a name="70710-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07071070000092"></a>I am reminded that in all the discussions last week&#151;the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement, the Green Paper on better governance&#151;there was a clear intention that we should seek to develop schemes that give more authority, responsibility and accountability to our local government, as to our central government. But this seems to be a recipe for confused accountability. The noble Baroness must explain how this model will ever operate in those circumstances and give to the people more sense of responsibility and accountability. If, in fact, the model is never taken up by any authority and will never be a model with which any authority believes it can provide that system of local governance, it is a waste of the time of this House and Parliament.</p>

Irrespective of whether they are there for four years or whether there are elections by thirds or by halves, there seems to be no concept that the elected executive could go wrong or run awry. I know the argument regarding elected mayors who run their own operations&#151;they are in the hands of the electorate after four years. I do not believe that we can talk about allowing an executive to run a council for four years, with full responsibility for every service and every penny of the council, with no way of getting rid of them until the next election.</p>

If the council gets into trouble, that will bring the role of at least the Standards Board into play&#151;if it is that sort of trouble. Parts of the executive body will always be susceptible to that. It is part of the model. I listened closely to what the noble Lord said and we will think about these arguments because, clearly, we are not familiar with this model. He mentioned detailed conflicts and we are happy to think about them. However, that is the system implicit in this model. My note from the Box has just reinforced my case.</p>

<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="07071070000096"></a><b><a name="70710-0014.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07071070000167"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> That was the most encouraging thing that I have heard in the past two or three hours: the Minister said that the Government were thinking about these things. That is good news, because there are so many questions and potential problems that all we can ask the Government to do is to think. We hope that their thinking comes up with something that is a bit better.</p>

<a name="70710-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07071070000097"></a>Returning to the question of what I keep calling aldermanic by-elections, but are actually elected executive by-elections, let us assume that there is an executive of six members. It is likely that they will be on the ballot paper in six wards. Assuming that they are all fairly prominent people in their party&#146;s leadership on the council&#151;the sort of people who would get on the executive if the existing executive arrangements applied&#151;they will be standing for different wards and will probably be leading their tickets in each of those, say, three-member wards. There will be a lot of by-elections&#151;it is not just a question of one or two. It is not like an election for a mayor, involving one person and in which one ward has a by-election. There will be a mini-general election for that authority. We are not raising trivial matters, of which it can be said, &#147;The by-elections will happen and who cares about a few by-elections?&#148;. If the election is for a bigger executive of, say, eight people, half the wards in an authority such as an ordinary district council could have by-elections five or six weeks after the ordinary May elections. It could change control, but perhaps it would not matter because the elected executive would have total power.</p>

<a name="70710-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07071070000098"></a>Secondly, I want to pick up the point the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, raised about what to do if things go wrong, because things will go wrong. You cannot design structures which guarantee utopia. You cannot design structures which guarantee adequate leadership, never mind excellent leadership. There will be people who are the wrong people, cannot cope, or  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1368"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column 1368</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for whatever reasons go off the rails. What does the council do under those circumstances? At the moment there are checks and balances within the council that allow something to happen. The majority party may sort it out and come up with a fresh leadership. Maybe a wider group of people on the council say that things have to change, and perhaps the next time they meet things will have changed. This system, as the noble Baroness said, is going to produce rigidity&#151;a lack of flexibility&#151;over four years. If everything is going wonderfully, there is no problem, but systems should not be designed for when things go wonderfully; they should be designed to cope with difficulties.</p>

<a name="70710-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07071070000099"></a>Finally, the Minister said that in order to get such a system, a council would have to show that it will secure continuous improvement. That seems to me to beg the whole question of elections. Whether councils bring continuous improvement or any other sort of improvement will depend on who gets elected. You cannot design systems to guarantee continuous improvement. It all depends on who gets elected, who is running it and who is in control. There seems to be the fallacy at the heart of what has been proposed that you can get continuous improvement by imposing structures from above. You cannot.</p>

On by-elections and ward councillors, if this model is adopted, people will understand the implications and common sense will prevail. We have to bear that in mind in terms of who chooses to stand as a ward councillor as well as an executive. Of course, a lot will depend on the leader and the way the process is constructed.</p>

<a name="70710-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07071070000101"></a>On continuous improvement and what happens if things go wrong, things have gone wrong with councils over the past 10 years and various strategies have been employed to assist, intervene, support and change. That is one reason why we have had continuous improvement in our councils. This council is not going to be any different from any other council in that respect. The normal checks and balances will remain, not least the strategic powers&#151;the quasi-judicial powers, for example, which continue to rest for the planning committee in terms of the relative role of the leader. I have listened to noble Lords, and I will read <I>Hansard </I>very closely and reply to anything I have not been able to reply to.</p>

<a name="70710-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07071070000103"></a>First, on planning, presumably it is the executive who lead on plan-making even if there is a quasi-judicial committee which deals with development control matters. Secondly, am I right in thinking that because the budget is a decision for the whole council, subject obviously to negotiations&#151;there are provisions about putting a budget in place by a certain point in the year&#151;the non-executive part of the council could stymie the executive&#146;s proposals for the budget, which might be a particular possibility if it is of a different political complexion from the executive? Therefore,

When we researched the Bill and looked at this clause and others, we were all surprised to discover that Section 11(5) and (6) of the 2000 Act provide for an elected executive arrangement. Section 11(5) says that the executive of the authority,</p>

Amendment No. 149A removes the reference in Section 33L of the Act, as inserted by Clause 64, to the procedure for moving from directly elected leadership arrangements to new forms of executive arrangements provided through Section 11(5) of the 2000 Act. In short, they would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s regulation-making power, provided for in Section 11(5) and (6) of the Local Government Act 2000, which enables the Secretary of State to make regulations prescribing different forms of executive arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07071078000010"></a>We have just concluded a lively debate about executive arrangements, but the amendment would narrow the range of choices and executive arrangements that we can make available to authorities. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, believed that our proposal to allow local authorities to choose to operate a directly elected executive would render superfluous Section 11(5) and (6) and asked why they were necessary. They provide for new forms of executive, including where some or all of the executive members are directly elected. He is correct that they provide for new forms of elected executive arrangements. However, they also allow for any new executive arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07071078000011"></a>We set out the three models in the White Paper, but other models may come forward in due course. It is important to retain the powers in Sections 11(5) and (6) so that we can respond to any local authority that feels it has a better idea or something that would facilitate better leadership. If we do not leave the power where it is, the only opportunity a local authority would have would be to wait for the next bout of primary legislation. The powers under the Act provide for flexibility, and I am sure that noble Lords would want that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07071078000012"></a>I understand that the requirement of a two-thirds majority reflects that the council would be adopting a model that was wholly innovative and which had not been specified in the Bill.

We are obviously content that a council that wishes to move to a governance model as set out in the Bill should do so by a simple majority. The model will have been set out in primary legislation, and everyone would have been able to read the intention. A model set out in the regulations under Section 11(5) of the Local Government Act 2000 would not have been through the same debate and process of contest. Therefore, we think that a two-thirds majority of the council should be required before adopting a model that is derived from regulations. That is the full explanation.</p>

It is a simple matter. If the Government believe that lots of different models are a good idea, they should accept this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="07071078000022"></a>Some of us are worried that the Government have a clear idea of which models work and which do not.

In those circumstances, the size of the executive could be extremely important, and it could become impossible for a number of councillors to serve on it because they would simply have too much responsibility to cover all the levels of service required in a council of that size.</p>

<a name="70710-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="07071078000025"></a>There is also the issue of geographical spread. In a geographically large county such as Cornwall, if a very small executive is effectively to take power on behalf of the whole authority, it will inevitably mean that members from a small number of geographical areas will be perceived to be taking full responsibility for all council services. Therefore, a little latitude on the Government&#146;s behalf to enable the total on the executive to increase to one-quarter of the council membership would clearly give the flexibility that, in fairness, the noble Baroness was supporting so enthusiastically just a few seconds ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="07071078000027"></a>Let us think about what it would mean in practice. For example, Birmingham City Council has 120 members today, so the city&#146;s executive would swell to 30 members under these proposals. I suggest that that is not an executive but a leadership group of a fairly significant size&#151;more of a big committee. It leads me to wonder whether the noble Lord is trying to reintroduce the committee system by the side door, as it were. We have already set out in evidence the benefits of a small leadership group. That is not new: a maximum of 10 for such a group was set out in the 2000 Act. I have not heard evidence as to why that should be changed. On the contrary, <I>The New Council Constitutions</I> on<I></I>the outcomes and impact of the Local Government Act 2000, the independent evidence that I quoted earlier, also said that executives of up to 10 members are right for delivering visible and effective leadership. I take the noble Lord&#146;s earlier point that we should perhaps be talking about better leadership rather than stronger leadership. However, this research looked at the functions and attributes of leadership and talked about better leadership, too. I am afraid that the amendments would put the clock back and unpick the 2000 Act, so I reluctantly conclude that I cannot accept them.</p>

It is no good saying to councillors, &#147;You can champion this or scrutinise that&#148;. Councillors need to be involved in making decisions. Good councillors will always have ways to do that, such as through pre-decision scrutiny or through working groups working to executive members, a model which works in some places. Some councils have got around the legislation by effectively having advisory committees to executive members, who take the decisions but do what the committee wants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="07071078000030"></a>All sorts of models exist; the Government need to realise that local government is very diverse. Every council is different, with a different culture. Even councils that from the outside appear to be operating the same models are different. I sit on an executive of 10 and ask myself what the difference is between that and a committee. I do not know; it operates as a committee. You can have an executive of six to 10 people that meets to discuss agenda items&#151;it does not rubber-stamp them&#151;where the public and councillors who are not on the executive can take part, making points on behalf of their ward, town or other interests.

Such committees typically deal with functions such as development control planning applications, which are not executive functions, and will also have executive functions devolved to them, perhaps quite substantial ones. I understand that the legislation that allows that is Section 18 of the 2000 Act, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="07071078000116"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for or in connection with enabling an executive of a local authority, or a committee or specified member of such an executive, to arrange for the discharge of any functions which, under executive arrangements, are the responsibility of the executive by an area committee of that authority&#148;.</p>

<a name="70710-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="07071078000041"></a>Where area committees work well, they work extremely well. They are a way of devolving decision-making to a town, a neighbourhood or an area of the authority that ties in extremely well with the Government&#146;s present neighbourhood agenda. It is one way to do it. They are not just committees of councillors but may have co-opted members from parish councils or from local organisations such as the chamber of trade, a town centre action group or whatever it happens to be. I speak as a member of an exciting body called the Colne and District Area Committee, which is far and away the most interesting and useful meeting I go to every month. Such bodies involve large numbers of local members of the public who come to meetings not just to listen but to take part and put their views forward, which is absolutely in line with the Government&#146;s agenda.</p>

<a name="70710-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="07071078000042"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to probe the Government on whether such area committees will continue to have a right to exist&#151;I assume that the answer is yes&#151;and, if they do, whether they are there as the creatures of the leader of the council only and depend on him devolving powers to them or whether the council as a whole or the executive of the council can incorporate such measures within the constitution of the council so that a leader who does not like what an area is doing cannot over-ride it. It is crucial that area committees have autonomy within their terms of reference. If they do not have that autonomy, their raison d&#146;être disappears because they can be over-ruled from on high. That is a very important question. I beg to move.</p>

Amendment No. 123B relates to arrangements for the discharge of an executive&#146;s functions by an area committee, by the executive of another local authority, or by another local authority.

That essentially would provide that decisions about discharging functions under arrangements made under Section 18 should in effect be subject to approval by the full council. That obviously contradicts what we are trying to do in concentrating executive arrangements and focusing executive functions. That must lie&#151;this includes the methods by which they are discharged&#151;with the executive. In our new arrangements, as we will probably discuss, all the executive functions are to be vested in the leader of the executive. To provide that, if the leader or the executive wished to discharge certain of their functions in a particular way, they must have the support of the full council is obviously contradictory to the concept of executive functions.</p>

<a name="70710-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="07071078000046"></a>It is worth reminding noble Lords about the limits to executive functions. Under the 2000 Act there are specific areas that are not executive functions, and those are the major strategic decisions: the budget; the council&#146;s sustainable community strategy; and quasi-judicial matters such as planning and licensing. It is absolutely right for the council to take those strategic decisions, particularly in relation to quasi-judicial decisions. They should not be in the hands of a small executive. All the other functions of an authority rightly lie with the executive and in future, in the first instance, with the leader. That includes decisions about how the executive functions are to be discharged.</p>

</ul>(1) Any local authority in England may submit a scheme of internal governance appropriate to its circumstances, which shall stand deferred until the next ordinary day of election and may not take effect until the day after that day.(2) Where no recognised group has overall control, it shall be competent for the council to implement other arrangements as it may determine.&#148;

<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="07071078000056"></a>The noble Baroness said: My amendment is similar to Amendment No. 128A, but, as mine got there first, I shall speak first and wait to be supported on it. Amendment No. 127 would enable any local authority in England to submit a scheme of internal governance that is appropriate to its circumstances. This carries on the debates that we have been having and would enforce the local choice. In the incredibly useful committee evidence hearings, two out of three representatives from the Local Government Association were in favour of local authorities having choice over their governance arrangements. They were in favour of non-binding legislation.</p>

<a name="70710-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="07071078000057"></a>Amendment No. 127 was debated at great length in another place, but the Minister&#146;s arguments against giving local authorities an empowering, decentralised power to choose was not completely convincing. The Minister in the other place said that due to the large amounts of money managed by councils it was right that the Government should dictate how they managed their leadership, and his argument focused on the need to ensure accountability. The last time we checked, councils were accountable to their electorate.</p>

<a name="70710-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="07071078000058"></a>The Minister&#146;s remarks were very telling. He said that councils should not decide how to run their own affairs because,</p>
<ul><a name="07071078000126"></a>&#147;that is not in their interests&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill Committee, 20/2/07; col. 278.]</ul>
<p><a name="07071078000109"></a>I support fully the role of cabinet members where a local authority chooses to have them. However, the Government&#146;s approach in debate in another place was antipathetic to the autonomy of councils and the trust that should be invested in them by central government. In the light of that and in the absence of any evidence to suggest that councils wish to sign over their internal governance arrangements to central government restriction, I beg to move the amendment.</p>

We have had a long debate on this issue today, and I do not need to say too much, save to once again urge the Government to reconsider their adherence to the principle that we must have what they describe as strong models, which should be limited to three. At the moment, local authorities will have only three models available, and one of those is fairly unworkable, as we have discovered, and will be taken up by very few authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="07071078000062"></a>The executive arrangements that the Government want are designed for councils in which one group has a clear overall majority. They are not designed for councils with no overall control and, particularly, they are not designed for small district and rural councils that may consist of several groups and a number of independents. Such arrangements in those councils simply do not work properly. They are designed for a situation where there is a party that can get a grip on it. They may work in more political urban councils or big county councils where perhaps two parties can work together well; they do not work well in smaller councils where there is a larger variety. They have to be made to work and people make them work, but they are not designed for them. We urgently need more flexibility for such councils to design arrangements that suit their own circumstances.</p>

This is very much a discussion about the way in which we see leadership operating and the way we want to enable it.</p>

<a name="70710-0015.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="07071078000064"></a>Amendments Nos. 127, 128A and 132 to 134 have all the effect of enabling any council, regardless of size or type, to operate any form of governance arrangements they see fit. I am slightly puzzled by the suggestion that somehow we are imposing uniform options on councils. There are three models but within the leader and cabinet models, for example, there are different ways of making this work. Many councils adopt leader and cabinet models now and they have not sacrificed their individuality or their local characteristics. While I understand what noble Lords are saying&#151;clearly it is one of this country&#146;s great strengths that it is so diverse&#151;we must be careful not to exaggerate that or to exaggerate the impact this measure will have.</p>

<a name="70710-0015.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="07071078000065"></a>For the many reasons I have explained at length today, I cannot succumb to thinking that every local authority should have whatever internal governance arrangements that it considers appropriate. The time has come for a strategy to support and enable better leadership, and that is what the White Paper did and what the Bill does. That is supported by evidence.</p>

<a name="70710-0015.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="07071078000066"></a>It is worth reflecting that what we are doing is not new. We are building on the 2000 Act, which was the first attempt to separate the executive role&#151;the visible councillor in the executive position&#151;from the back-bench councillor. It is working; fewer people want to go back to the committee system. The enhanced committee system seems to operate in smaller local authorities, usually by the addition of an overview and scrutiny committee that enhances its functions. However, it is not easy to replicate that in a larger council with any guarantee of success.</p>

This group of amendments brings us almost to the conclusion of this discussion, although maybe not quite. There is a terrible irony that here we are in July 2007 discussing the modes of governance of local councils, when we were discussing that in 2000. Seven years later, the thing still has not settled down. There are still concerns about the way the governance is being regulated and directed. Perhaps we need a bit more flexibility than we have now. Still, I have heard the Minister&#146;s response and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The first is to flag up what has been alluded to previously in passing: the ability of councils to change their means of executive arrangements. That sounds innocuous. It means that councils will be able to decide&#151;without referendum, without reference to the people&#151;that they want to move either to an elected mayor or to an elected executive. If it goes through in that form and a referendum is not required, it will lead to a degree of public scandal in some places.</p>

<a name="70710-0015.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="07071078000073"></a>Amendment No. 153 is about the role of the leader of the council or the elected mayor. If there is a proposal to move in the opposite direction from an elected mayor to a leader and cabinet system, in effect it is to remove what the Government are doing, which is to give an elected mayor a veto over such a move so that no move can take place unless the elected mayor or the leader of the council agrees to it. That is quite wrong. If there is a move locally to change the system of executive arrangements, that should be done in a democratic way, rather than giving one person, who has a personal vested interest, a veto over it. As we know, there are a number of places where elected mayors and elected mayoral systems have got into bother, while others are working quite well. If it is the view of the Government that changes should be possible, those changes should not be subject to such a veto. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="07071078000075"></a>The Minister will be aware of the situation that has arisen in Doncaster, where the Doncaster Fair Deal campaigners have drawn up a petition to change from the elected mayor and cabinet system currently in operation. Using the provisions of the Local Government Act 2000, more than 11,000 people signed a petition requesting a referendum on changing the system of governance. It was taken to full council and won.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="07071078000076"></a>I understand that the authority subsequently refused to take action on the basis that the current five-year rule will be rendered null and void by the Bill in front of us. This Bill will leave current arrangements in place for 10 years, so Doncaster and any other authority where arrangements appear not to be working and are no longer wanted will be stuck with an unpopular system of governance for a decade. That is far too long where the system has self evidently lost the confidence of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="07071078000077"></a>Amendment No. 153 is another attempt to remove the ludicrous requirement that in order for change to happen the existing elected mayor or leader has to assent. If I were visiting another country to look at its system of governance and found that the only way you could get rid of someone was if they themselves agreed to be got rid of, I would report that back as an outrage and a sham of democracy. It is quite extraordinary that it will be part of the Bill.</p>

Amendment No. 128B would enable a council to vary its executive arrangements more than once. The effect of Amendment No. 128 would be to deny authorities the ability to change their executive models from one to another. The effect of Amendment No. 153 would be to enable changes between models of executive to occur during the term of office of a mayor or leader of a directly elected executive without their permission. I heard what the noble Baroness said, but the amendments seem to cut down on the scope and the democratic powers of local government.</p>

<a name="70710-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="07071078000079"></a>Clause 64 enables local authorities operating executive arrangements to change their governance arrangements, including the adoption of a directly elected form of executive. It cannot and would not be our intention at all that a council could never change its mind about the model that it had chosen. It is obviously sensible for a council to be able to move from one model to another if it finds, after a period with one model, that it can now see the benefits of another. Surely, by removing Section 33A and preventing a council from changing that model, we would be doing a major disservice to that council. Clearly, we believe that councils should be able to change if they believe that it is appropriate. We want to keep that flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="07071078000080"></a>We believe that Amendment No. 128 is unnecessary. The Bill as it stands provides that councils can vary their executive arrangements any number of times that they choose. I hope that that will satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. A council that after the enactment of the Bill adopts the leader and cabinet executive model can, if it so chooses, subsequently decide to adopt the elected executive model. Thereafter, at a later date, it could adopt the mayor and cabinet model or alternately it might revert to the leader and cabinet model. So it can go backwards and forwards between the three models if it so chooses&#151;and there are processes and timetables for doing that which make it consistent with the council&#146;s election. The Bill sets that out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="07071078000081"></a>Amendments Nos. 128 and 153 are where the perversity comes in. If we passed Amendment No. 128, there would be no flexibility to move between models and, if we passed Amendment No. 153, there would be no flexibility to modify the executive arrangements. We believe that flexibility is essential. Obviously, local authorities may be able to identify improvements that make the model that they have chosen more effective in providing strategic leadership, but it is only right that the changes to the governance arrangements of mayors and Cabinet executives or elected executives must have the specific consent of the mayor or the elected executive leader, both of whom have a direct mandate from the electorate of the whole council area. To prevent this from happening would actually be undemocratic. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

In practice, there is today only one such council in this category: Brighton and Hove.

Such councils must operate the new leader and Cabinet model from their annual meeting in 2009. These councils&#146; proposals must set out their arrangements regarding the discharge of functions between the council and its executive, set out a timetable for the move and give appropriate publicity with regard to the implementation of executive arrangements.</p>

The amendments would go further by enabling them permanently to retain alternative arrangements. Interestingly, I notice that noble Lords, for a change, support government Amendments Nos. 135 and 157. Whereas we will replace those sections with a new clause in Amendment No. 191, they are content simply to remove them. However, we cannot

The small councils concerned will be free to operate alternative arrangements and the Bill does not affect them. However, we do not believe that large authorities that are delivering strategic services such as adult care or children&#146;s services should operate alternative arrangements which do not provide for clear leadership. That is the burden of our amendments. I hope that noble Lords will be able to accept them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000015"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071062000293"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Gambling Act 2005 (Horserace Totalisator Board) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000016"></a>The noble Lord said: With the leave of the Committee, I will speak also to the Gambling Act 2005 (Amendment of Schedule 6) Order 2007 and the Gambling Act 2005 (Horserace Betting Levy) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000017"></a>The context for today&#146;s debate is the coming into force on 1 September this year of the Gambling Act 2005. Your Lordships will recall that this Act establishes the Gambling Commission as a regulator for gambling in Great Britain, thus creating a unified, streamlined licensing regime for gambling operators and premises.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000018"></a>In general terms, the Act requires those offering facilities for gambling to obtain an operating licence issued by the Gambling Commission. Where premises are used to provide gambling facilities, the Act requires a premises licence to be obtained from the local authority. Generally, a person can be granted a premises licence only if they hold an operating licence authorising the activity.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000019"></a>I will begin by summarising the purpose of the three draft instruments. The first two allow two specific bodies&#151;the Horserace Betting Levy Board and the Tote&#151;to continue to operate for the time being. The Levy Board would continue until a satisfactory alternative commercial mechanism is identified; and the Tote would be retained in its present form until such time as its sale is completed. The Gambling Act was drafted on the basis that neither body would exist at the time that the Act came into force; hence the need for these orders.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000020"></a>The third instrument ensures the effective continued operation of the Levy Board by permitting information to flow between it and the Gambling Commission for the purpose of carrying out their respective functions. It also adds the British Boxing Board of Control to the list of sports bodies contained in the 2005 Act for the purposes of information sharing, thus helping to ensure openness and integrity in betting on boxing matches.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC184"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000021"></a>I turn to the detail of the instruments. The first that we have to consider is the draft Gambling Act 2005 (Horserace Betting Levy) Order 2007. The horserace betting levy was established under the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963 to collect money from bookmakers and the Tote for three statutory purposes: the improvement of breeds of horses; the advancement of veterinary science and education; and the improvement of horseracing. The Horserace Betting Levy Board was set up as a public body to receive the levy and administer payments from it, including race prize money and integrity payments.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000022"></a>In March 2000, the Government announced their intention to abolish the Levy Board and the levy mechanism. This was in response to the racing industry&#146;s view that a more modern, commercially based funding mechanism was available, whereby TV coverage of races and data on runners and riders, fixture lists and so on could be sold to bookmakers at commercial rates. Provision was made for the abolition of the board in the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004. However, a European Court of Justice ruling in November 2004 cast serious doubt over racing&#146;s ability to secure adequate payment for the use of its data, and therefore over the viability of the proposed replacement funding model. As a result of that ruling and the recommendations of the Future Funding of Racing Review Group, my honourable friend in the other place, Richard Caborn, the then Sports Minister, announced in December 2006 that the levy and the Levy Board should be retained until such time as a secure alternative commercial funding arrangement could be identified.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000023"></a>The main purpose of the order is therefore to allow the Levy Board to remain in existence and continue to carry out all its functions after 1 September. In due course, we intend to repeal Part 2 of the 2004 Act, which provided for the abolition of the levy system. That will ensure that Parliament can debate a measure to abolish the levy in the light of circumstances which may prevail at the time.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000024"></a>The order has a secondary purpose. Under the 2005 Act, the Gambling Commission issues operating licences to bookmakers. This replaces the system under the 1963 Act, which required bookmakers to hold bookmakers&#146; permits. Under the old system, the relevant authority could refuse to renew a permit if the Levy Board provided evidence that a bookmaker had repeatedly failed to pay the levy.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000025"></a>Article 3 of the order allows the Levy Board to continue to take a role in the review and revocation of licences by requiring the commission to carry out a review of an operating licence if notified by the board that the holder of the licence has failed to pay the levy for at least three months, and to revoke the licence if appropriate. It also allows the bookmaker the opportunity to make representations to the commission before any decision to revoke their operating licence for non-payment of the levy is made.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000026"></a>I now turn to the second draft instrument. As the Committee will know, the Horserace Totalisator Board&#151;the Tote&#151;is a statutory corporation established by the Government under the Racecourse Betting Act 1928 to provide pool betting services on horseracing.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC185"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000027"></a>In line with the Government&#146;s commitment to disengage from areas of life where it is no longer appropriate for central Government to have a role, legislative provision was made in the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004 for the Tote to be removed from the public sector.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000028"></a>Specifically, Part 1 of the 2004 Act enables the Government to dissolve the Tote and create a successor company to receive its assets and liabilities for onward sale to a commercial operator. The Act also enables the Government to direct the Gambling Commission to issue this third party with an exclusive seven-year licence to offer pool betting services.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000029"></a>It is now clear that the dissolution of the Tote and the issuing of the exclusive licence will not have been achieved by 1 September, the date on which the 2005 Act comes into force. That is because our initial intention to sell the Tote at a fair price was challenged by the European Commission. The consortium of racing interests with which the Government were in negotiations then found it difficult to meet the higher, market price.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000030"></a>However, now that the staff and management of the Tote have themselves joined the consortium, negotiations are proceeding and the Government hope to be able to announce how we intend to proceed shortly. The order is designed to enable the Tote to continue to operate on its current basis from 1 September until such time as those negotiations are concluded or the Tote is otherwise disposed of. The order therefore allows the lawful continuation of the 1963 Act arrangements for pool betting on horseraces.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000031"></a>The order also amends Section 33 of the 2005 Act to ensure that the Tote, and others acting under its authority, can exercise its exclusive statutory right to offer pool betting without requiring an operating licence. That mirrors the position under the 1963 Act, under which a bookmaker&#146;s permit is not required to authorise such activity. The order also ensures that a person commits an offence if they infringe the Tote&#146;s exclusive right to provide pool betting. A consequential amendment to Section 163 of the 2005 Act enables the Tote to obtain a betting premises licence without holding a betting operating licence.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000032"></a>Finally, Sections 336 to 338 of the 2005 Act enable the Gambling Commission in certain circumstances to void bets accepted by the holder of a betting operating licence. The order modifies these provisions to ensure that they also apply where bets are entered into with the Tote, or a person acting with the authority of the Tote. It therefore subjects the Tote to the same controls as other betting operators in this regard.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000033"></a>The Gambling Act 2005 (Amendment of Schedule 6) Order 2007 concerns the exchange of information between the Gambling Commission and other authorities. For the Horserace Betting Levy Board to fulfil its statutory functions and to be in a position to object to the issuing of an operating licence or call for the withdrawal of such a licence, it must have access to an up-to-date list of betting operators and to bookmaking information that is not in the public domain. Part 2 of Schedule 6 to the 2005 Act lists enforcement and regulatory officials and bodies to which the Gambling  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC186"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Commission is empowered to supply information and which may themselves supply information to the commission. The order amends Part 2 to include an entry for the Levy Board, thus allowing the board to have access to information on bookmakers held by the commission and to provide information to the commission.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000034"></a>The order also includes a measure designed to extend the Gambling Commission&#146;s information-sharing powers to boxing, which is among the sports other than horseracing on which British betting operators increasingly take bets. The British Boxing Board of Control, the governing body for professional boxing, has asked to be added to the list of bodies in Part 3 of Schedule 6 to the 2005 Act, which lists sports governing bodies to which the Gambling Commission is empowered to supply information. The Gambling Commission supports boxing&#146;s inclusion, and the order amends Part 3 to include an entry for the British Boxing Board of Control.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000035"></a>Information-sharing is part of a suite of measures introduced by the Act that are intended to help to uphold high levels of sports betting integrity. Other measures include voiding of bets and a new offence of cheating. Information-sharing is vital for the effective investigation of alleged breaches of a sport&#146;s governing body rules or the placing of illegal bets.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000036"></a>All three orders before us today are practical measures. The first two are designed to ensure that the modernised, improved betting environment that is created by the Gambling Act and by its precursor, the 2004 Act, comes into force in respect of the Horserace Betting Levy Board and the Tote only when the time is right. Specifically, on the first order, it remains our wish to find a commercial alternative to the levy to finance the expense of the racing industry on horse breeding, veterinary science and the improvement of horseracing. Nevertheless, it is clear for the present that the retention of the levy is the most satisfactory means to fund this legitimate and desirable expenditure. The order allows the levy board to continue to operate while a more satisfactory commercial arrangement is being sought. The second order provides the extra time that we need to ensure that the dissolution of the Tote and the sale and licensing of its assets and functions proceed smoothly and in the interests of punters.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000037"></a>The third order provides for the free flow of information between the Gambling Commission and the Horserace Betting Levy Board, and it extends the list of sports regulatory bodies that enjoy a free flow of information with the commission. The former action will help to ensure that the Levy Board remains properly equipped to carry out its functions; the latter will help to maintain high integrity standards in betting. All three measures are sensible and, I hope, commend themselves to noble Lords. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>

As we have heard, that was as a result of a ruling by the European Court of Justice in November 2004 casting doubt on the viability of the proposed replacement funding model. This is not a very satisfactory state of affairs; in fact it is a mess. When, if ever, do the Government expect that secure funding will be available to carry out their original intentions regarding the Levy Board?</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000040"></a>The second order is also a continuation order, which is necessary because of the interminable delays over the sale of the Tote. The Government clearly forgot the European state-aid rules when formulating their original plans. Some six years later, it now seems likely that this will happen at last. However, will the Minister say when and tell us the real market value of the Tote? What has been the cost to the taxpayer of these many negotiations, and are the Government certain that the ownership of the Tote is legally vested in them?</p>

<p><a name="07071062000041"></a>The third order need not delay us for long, as it is merely an enabling measure necessary to permit the Horserace Betting Levy Board and the British Boxing Board of Control to be added to the list of bodies to which the Gambling Commission can supply information.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000042"></a>These three orders should not have been necessary and are direct evidence of the way in which the Government have continually mishandled the horseracing industry in the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000043"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071062000295"></a>Viscount Falkland:</b> There is nothing in these three orders to which one can take exception. The Minister has explained them very well. If the Committee will indulge me, I shall make a few comments not only on the orders but on the background to them. Horseracing in this country is going through a very fraught time. The constituent parts of what we call British horseracing have all faced difficulties. There have been enormous problems in achieving any kind of consensus on how racing should progress, although the horses still race and go around tracks. The racecourse authorities tell us that their main concern is to demystify racing. I have never understood that. It is a perfectly understandable business; horses either go straight or in a circle, with the objective of reaching the winning post. Those who have backed the horse to win or horses to place will receive money; those who have not will lose their money. I knew that at 10 years old, and I do not see why the people in the corporate boxes, who seem to populate most of the racecourses today, cannot understand it either.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000044"></a>The main problem with racing is the funding of it. That is the headache which the British Horseracing Authority has now taken on under the capable chairmanship of Mr Paul Roy, an experienced businessman and racecourse owner. We have high expectations of him, and I have no reason to think that we may be disappointed. His main task is to draw the strings together so that the constituent fighting parts of racing channel their efforts to ensure that racing remains at the cultural centre of sporting life in this country. At the moment, the problem is that racing is losing a great deal of support among people  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC188"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who follow it. That does not mean that racecourses are not full of people going racing; it means that they are full of people who entertain. It is more of a day out now, unless one goes to odd meetings at Newmarket or to meetings in July at which the people are mostly professionals. People no longer bet on horses to the extent that they did; they bet on other sporting events. The income has come down, and the levy contribution has gone down accordingly.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000045"></a>The Merits Committee made a very interesting observation about something that has puzzled me, although it did not mention virtual reality horseracing, or cartoon horseracing, which concerns me more. Nor did it say whether that attracts levy contributions, which of course it does not. More extraordinary&#151;this overlaps with other orders&#151;is the fact that the income now going to the bottom line of bookmakers from betting shops, which replaces the lost turnover from racing, comes from fixed-odds betting terminals, which is a euphemism for gaming machines. Anyone who cares to put their head inadvisedly into a betting shop of an afternoon will see a pretty sad picture. People who are usually at the bottom end of the socio-economic scale in Britain&#151;unfortunate members of our society&#151;go in, presumably with a fixed amount of cash which they are prepared to lose, and lose it, because if they have a win on the horses, you can be sure as eggs are eggs that they will lose it either on another horserace or on the machines. I have seen that and would advise anyone who is interested in this whole field to spend an afternoon in a leading betting shop.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000046"></a>The orders tidy up the new Act so that we achieve the objective of funding racing, which requires us to continue with the Levy Board. Understandably, the Government want to get rid of the Levy Board because they do not want always to have to arbitrate in rows between bookmakers and those who seek to collect from them what is due for enjoying the product on which they make their profits. I am very glad to see that the orders mention the compulsion that there will be for bookmakers ultimately to pay their dues to the Levy Board. That did not exist in the same form previously. I refer to the profits from machines in betting shops. They are there expressly as part of the horseracing industry and were created for that purpose. Incidentally, it was for that reason that the Irish Government decided not to have machines in betting shops. They thought that it was inconsistent with the aims of betting shops to be part of the racing industry and declared that gaming machines were no part of the racing industry. The Irish, as usual, have proved themselves somewhat cleverer than we are on this subject. That is not unusual these days; the Irish are very clever in many fields.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000047"></a>Of course, we accept the orders, which seem to cover every aspect, including the Tote sale. That sale is not inevitable. I shall believe it when I see it. We have the deadline for the ending of the Tote under the legislation because the competition authorities in this country deemed it right and proper that we should end the Tote monopoly, although every other racing regime in the civilised world has a Tote monopoly. It is a strange anomaly of modern life in Britain that we should have taken that view. It will be very interesting  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC189"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to see how the Tote ends up. That is another wool-over-the-eyes aspect of racing in Britain. I have to explain to people the whole time what a betting exchange is, and I have become very adept at it. I do not know how the parliamentary draftsmen would deal with businesses connected with betting exchanges because even these quite simple things are expressed in language which is not particularly easy to understand. I can explain what a betting exchange and a totalisator pool are, but most people out in the streets do not really know the difference between a fixed-odds pool and a totalisator pool. We talk about selling the Tote but we are in fact selling betting shops&#151;the major component of the value, which is about &#163;400 million. The Tote is, in fact, a bookmaker; it is not a Tote operator except as a marginal exercise. Most of its bottom-line profit comes from its activities as a high street bookmaker. That, again, is part of the obfuscation which surrounds racing in this country, which is unusual. In neighbouring countries such as France policemen deal with the crime that may spring from gambling connected with horseracing and pass over the business of running racing to a highly controlled body.</p>

I own horses&#151;or at least one very expensive and rather ailing animal&#151;and some very healthy and enthusiastic dogs. I used to manage casinos. I suspect that I am the only Member of your Lordships&#146; House who has ever done so. I emphasise that it was probably the only loss-making casino in the history of the world. There are not many that make a loss. I had the disadvantage to find when I took over that all my croupiers had broken fingers. It is very hard to spin a ball with broken fingers. The previous management had taken the precaution of breaking all their fingers to try to stop them stealing the money at the end of each day&#146;s play.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000050"></a>For some years I have also been the executive chairman of the Jockey Club&#146;s own racecourse-owning company, which owns 13 of the 59 courses in the country. Therefore, I have had experience of running the structure of complex racecourses, such as Aintree with the Grand National, Cheltenham and Newmarket, which has given me an insight into how the funding of racing has to apply. The Jockey Club racecourses in the last year that I was there committed to &#163;125 million worth of expenditure on building new stands in the same year that it put up &#163;34 million worth of prize money for the races run on its courses.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000051"></a>Such money does not come easily into the racing community. It can come in one of several ways. It can come from the levy that we have been talking about; it can come from the fees paid by owners to run their horses, which is probably the largest component of prize money&#151;owners race for their own money; and, finally, it comes from the entrance fees paid by the 1.5 million or so people who go to those racecourses in a year, and the corporate entertaining. So it is a very carefully balanced mechanism; and it should be because

It has a total employed workforce of over 150,000, which is heavily slanted towards the countryside community, and therefore a rarity in our modern day and age. It presents great opportunities for the employment of young people, particularly young people from migrant communities who provide very fine horse-handling skills. When you include the staff in the 10,000 betting shops in the country and the people connected with the catering and the provision of services and ground maintenance you come to well over 150,000 secure jobs, which, if lost, would make a big hole in the countryside&#146;s employment.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000052"></a>These instruments today are very important to us. I was very largely the cause of the comments made in the Merits Committee, which have already been quoted. I regret that only three of these instruments are being looked at today rather than as an entity with the other three, which will come in a few days&#146; time. I believe that they are a package and that they should be seen as a package. The instruments bear directly on the fairness and the potential profitability for bookmakers in certain respects of the services provided in betting shops, which in turn, as we have heard, already impact directly on the amount of funds that could be available for the levy.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000053"></a>There are some glaring errors in the instruments which in aggregate are coming before your Lordships&#146; Committee. There are some really big mistakes in them and some glaring omissions in them which would ensure a level playing field for everybody engaged in gaming in a betting shop. We have heard that there are elements involving FOBTs&#151;the fixed-odds betting terminals&#151;and we have heard about cartoon racing, which the noble Lord, Lord Davies, will be delighted to know, in the context of our previous exchange on the subject, does not include Donald Duck,.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000054"></a>I shall start with what I consider to be an example of a glaring error in one of the instruments. A FOBT will include a roulette machine and a blackjack machine. On the basis that your Lordships have not been into betting shops recently, the principle method is that you place a flat &#163;20 note into a slot and the machine will register 20 &#163;1 units available to bet with. You can keep on putting in as many &#163;20 notes as you have the ability to do or wish to do, and it will continue to clock up 20 &#163;1 units each time. In front of you will be a keypad, and you can then touch the numbers you wish to bet on before you press the start button to commence either cards being dealt for blackjack or the roulette wheel beginning to revolve. The screen shows an extremely realistic replica of an ivory ball spinning for the minimum of four times around the rim of a wooden wheel. According to betting psychologists, the sound of the ball spinning in the wheel is one of the big adrenaline triggers that gets a gambler hooked. The keypad allows you to put &#163;1 on a number each time you want to place a bet, and I do not know of any of the current FOBTs which have a restriction to prevent you betting &#163;1 time and again on the same number. So when we are given an instrument requiring that there should be a limit of &#163;1 per stake to a maximum odds of 35:1, as stipulated in one of the instruments, that is a fiction  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC191"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because it cannot be made to work on the available technology. In answer to a question put by the Merits Committee, the department acknowledged that that is the case.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000055"></a>Given that, I have some difficulty in understanding why we are passing any form of law which the department with the task of policing it acknowledges is unworkable. That particular order should be revisited as a matter of some urgency because there is no reason why you cannot feed &#163;20 into the FOBT and bet the whole lot on number 33 simply by pressing 33 on the touch pad 20 times. Similarly, when playing blackjack, you can split the cards and double the stake. There is no way of limiting the stakes on these machines as they stand to &#163;1. If the department seriously wants to put a limit on the amount that can be bet on a single spin of the wheel or a reveal of hands, they have not got it and they have specifically not provided for it in these instruments. That is my first objection.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000056"></a>I turn now with much more concern to cartoon racing, because this is where we come to address the issue of the viability of horseracing. Cartoon racing is completely free of any form of control, to the extent that while definitions are now being provided of what constitutes an electronic gaming machine, cartoon racing does not fit into any of them. It is very important for noble Lords to understand this because it is a hugely important matter in the context of the levy and everything that might come from that. Let us imagine ourselves to be in a betting shop. There we will see a screen which purports to be showing the racing for a place called Portman Park&#151;a leg-pull at the Jockey Club&#146;s old offices in Portman Square. Portman Park will declare that it is going to run six to eight races during the afternoon at approximately half-hourly intervals. Every race will include 18 runners, each of which will carry a name. But these horses and jockeys exist only in terms of the computer software. They do not have a track record in terms of form, and there are no variables in the circumstances that might give one horse a distinctive and identifiable chance over and above another. As a leading executive bookmaker said to me last week, &#147;What on Earth am I complaining about? It is only the equivalent of another form of roulette being played with images of horses instead of a little ivory ball&#148;.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000057"></a>No, it is not. In the matter of roulette, the FOBT offers odds of 35:1 for a single number being hit correctly, like any other roulette wheel in the world, and it offers even money for a colour, an odd, an even, a high or a low. However, the 18 horses being offered in conjunction with a cartoon race should all, strictly speaking, have odds of 17:1, but they do not. That is because, on a parallel screen, the bookmakers will be offering their market prices on the cartoon race, subjectively arrived at by some assessment of their own which cannot reflect the interest of a form book or any other yardstick by which one measures one chance against another. This, I believe, is completely wrong. It is illusory, misleading, and sucks unsuspecting punters in a betting shop into making a bet based on what the bookmakers will then manipulate so as to  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC192"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>quote one, two or three horses at shorter prices than the others to create the impression of market favouritism. Punters in betting shops tend always to follow and bet on the horses which are being backed at the shortest prices. So, instead of the fair 17:1, bookmakers are gaining the advantages of taking money on horses which are 17:1 shots on any basis of random selection and are taking money at odds of 2:1, 3:1 or 4:1, which is grossly unfair and, in my view, usurious.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000058"></a>At present, bookmakers have a rule which prohibits them from having more than four roulette FOBTs in a shop at any one time. Usually, one or two cartoon racing machines are going at the same time. Because the analysis has been carried out by the bookmakers themselves, undoubtedly the greatest utilisation of the FOBTs and the cartoon racing occurs during the time when conventional racing is taking place. The analysis shows that 85 per cent of the entire stakes on FOBTs and cartoon racing is taking place during the hours when the correct conventional racing is in hand. Therefore, it is entirely due to the footfall created by conventional racing, which supports the point made the noble Viscount, that this is driving in the turnover on which the bookmakers would expect to depend from conventional racing.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000059"></a>A FOBT roulette wheel is averaging &#163;500 per week profit on each of the four machines operated by bookmakers in every shop. There are 10,000 shops in this country, each making on that basis an average of &#163;2,000 per week. On that alone, a very high proportion of bookmakers&#146; profits in a year are excluded from the calculation of anything to do with the levy.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000060"></a>We should pay tribute to the huge amount of work done by the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, in trying to arrive at a solution to the conundrum of the levy. The noble Lord got very close to coming up with a workable solution, only for it to be torpedoed emphatically by the bookmakers refusing to provide the data required for the calculation. I am wholly in support of the extension of the levy arrangements. I want to see them enforced rigorously and emphatically by the DCMS without favour or mercy to the bookmakers. We need that money back into racing as quickly as we can. You have my full support for that.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000061"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071062000297"></a>Lord McIntosh of Haringey:</b> I thought that the noble Lord had finished.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000063"></a>On cartoon racing, I believe that the bookmakers should be called to account twice over. First, they should be required to recognise that it gives them a profit only because it coincides with the footfall created by racing and the funds should be included in the levy calculation. Secondly, I believe emphatically that the punter in the betting shop deserves that it should be brought within a strict set of controls which the DCMS should apply. I would want to see a complete exposure to an audit of the software system for every one of the cartoon racing devices put in. They do not fulfil the classification of a FOBT as offered with these instruments because there is a separation between the screen that shows the cartoon  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC193"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC193</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>racing and the screen that offers the odds. This is not an integrated betting concept. It is a separation, which is where the villainy stands in terms of what the bookmakers are offering at this time. I call strongly on the Government to withdraw the instruments to this extent and to review urgently the introduction of new controls on cartoon racing to bring them fairly into the open so that the punters can understand them.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000064"></a>As the noble Viscount said, we should not be disparaging about the people who occupy betting shops of a dark and dingy afternoon. It might not be our choice of an occupation, but perhaps we are rather more fortunate. The people who go to a betting shop of an afternoon many times are unemployed and perhaps, as was described, are not in the top economic quartile. They are there sometimes for comfort or protection against inclement weather, or because they are retired and bored in their domestic circumstances and are looking for relief elsewhere. But they are not, for all of those reasons, to be regarded as the needy and the greedy, or to be disparaged and left outside the care and protection of government. It is not the function of government to enhance the profits of bookmakers at the expense of level playing fields for the average man who walks into a betting shop of an afternoon. Such a man is just as deserving of our protection as anyone else in this community. On the strength of these statutory instruments, I do not think that the Government are getting it, and I call on them to withdraw the orders, which do not reflect the correct approach to cartoon betting in particular, and to introduce forthwith stringent and demanding requirements to comply with a set of standards that reflect the interests of the common man in the betting shop.</p>

A deal was done whereby the number of machines in each betting shop was restricted to four, and the speed of play and the stakes and prizes were supposedly limited. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord James, said, and I agree that there is certainly room for debate about

I have no doubt that the commission will do so. I ought to have declared an interest as a member of the Gambling Commission before I started this intervention.</p>

A story is told of the origins of the cartoon horseracing machines, which may help to illuminate the point the middle ground of which I think we are more or less agree on, and a glitch in the programme created by the bookmakers when the machines were first introduced into the shops in the first two weeks. The first horse that was seen to dash to the front immediately fell back into the body of the field, only to break into a run and win at the end. The bookmakers were being taken out by people betting on the first horse to be seen in the race while it ran at the outset. As a result, the programme was frozen after two weeks, and any horse that was first seen to go into the lead was programmed never to be able to win a race again. That is a demonstration of how far this whole system is capable of being corrupted by bookmaker intervention.</p>

The orders have been considered in the Commons, and we will of course consider them in Committee at the appropriate time, but I understand the noble Lord&#146;s reservations about them, as well as his point that they should be taken into account with regard to the levy because they affect the bookmakers&#146; income.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000070"></a>As the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, has indicated, the Government want out of this situation, which is the objective behind the Gaming Act and is the end to which all have been working. The Government intrude only when they are forced to make a contribution because there is no agreement between the parties. This is a somewhat invidious position which falls foul of the Government&#146;s intention to allow as much freedom in the market as possible, consistent with good behaviour so far as the ordinary citizen is concerned. Given that, the Government come in as the regulator only when they are obliged to do so. It is an odd form of regulation when the Government act as arbiter when the two sides do not reach agreement.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000071"></a>A situation we have become involved in recently&#151;and the sooner we are shot of it, the better&#151;is that of the hopes expressed on the changes being put forward. The noble Lord, Lord Luke, has been somewhat unfair in saying that the Government should have foreseen these difficulties. Everyone expected both the Government&#146;s position and the general situation to be upheld in Europe, and it came as something of a surprise when the bookmaker won on the issue of  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC195"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>information. From time to time these things happen, and they put a spoke in the best-oiled wheel. On this occasion, we have been obliged to stop the process and continue with the levy until we can put a new funding position in place. While the Government would have wished it differently, we are doing the best we can. We want the racing and betting industries to run their own affairs. It is not desirable for us to become involved in disputes, so as soon as something viable is produced, the Government will be out of the frame. The problem is that the arrival of the new TV service has complicated matters by changing the relationship with one of the two contending parties. This has led to difficulties. It is something that happens in commercial life and the Government have no wish to comment on the situation except to say that we have our clear objective: as soon as there is a stable commercial alternative, the levy will come to an end.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000072"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Luke, was worried about whether the Government had ownership of the Tote. I can confirm that the Crown owns the Tote and I understand that that has been the position since 1928. We have been proceeding on that basis and I am slightly concerned that the issue has arisen at all. However, I can do nothing other than reassure him on the point. In response to the question put about when the Tote is going to be sold, my answer is: as soon as possible. Offers are currently being considered and we are in discussions with a consortium over a number of detailed issues. The noble Lord asked me about the market value. That is commercially sensitive information at this stage, so I am not prepared to release the figure. He also asked me about the cost to the taxpayer. We think that we have costs of something in the order of &#163;2 million in connection with the sale of the Tote, a sum that will not look out of keeping with the eventual sale of the Tote and the inevitable costs associated with such a transfer. The noble Lord can rest assured that we do want to see the sale take place as rapidly as possible, but it depends on the successful bid being mobilised. The noble Lord will be all too well aware of why there have been some difficulties over this.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000073"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, raised some points that he wanted the Government to take note of. I have done so. He has an ally in the noble Lord, Lord James, in terms of anxiety about certain aspects of the additional facilities in bookmakers. I am grateful that my noble friend Lord McIntosh is here; he made it very clear that at times trade-offs must be effected with regard to machines in betting shops. We are mindful of what the noble Lord, Lord James, said, and of his dire warnings that when the relevant regulations come before the Grand Committee he is likely to be present. We shall take note of his comments and I shall do my best, having been forewarned, to be properly armed. I look upon that with obvious dread in light of his tirade today. I can only say that I hope that he will save his final position until the appropriate orders are considered and that he will give a fair wind to the orders that we are considering today.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000084"></a>The noble Lord said: The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 allows ex-offenders not to disclose old, &#147;spent&#148; convictions in order to improve their employment opportunities. The exceptions order to the Act sets out categories of work where, for reasons of public safety, the Act does not apply; that is, prospective workers in these fields are not entitled to conceal convictions irrespective of whether they are spent. The Criminal Records Bureau, in these cases, is permitted to release

Inclusion in the order does not mean that it is mandatory for employing organisations to carry out these checks&#151;simply that they are able to do so.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000085"></a>We have brought forward these latest amendments to keep the order current and to make sure that the needs of ex-offenders, employers and the general public remain balanced appropriately. The order was amended twice in 2006 and twice in the five years before that, but is being amended again to allow for pressing areas of high risk to children to be taken into account and to cover some other categories that have been proposed for inclusion.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000086"></a>We intend to introduce a further order in due course to reflect the original recommendations in the Bichard inquiry and ensure that all posts involving working with children and vulnerable adults are subject to the disclosure regime. This will coincide with the implementation of provisions contained in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act. In the mean time, we do not want to delay vital changes such as the inclusion of ContactPoint. We want to give protection as quickly as possible to children and vulnerable adults in respect of the employment categories set out in this order.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000087"></a>Other amendments, not related to the Bichard reforms, include allowing checks for employees of the Gambling Commission&#151;which will have law-enforcement responsibilities in respect of this industry&#151;and strengthening the position of the Financial Services Authority so that it may consider any criminal offences.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000088"></a>It may help if I go through the amendments that we are proposing as they appear in the draft order. We have updated the order to enable the finance industry and the Financial Services Authority to consider all spent offences that are committed by individuals falling within the order by deleting references to &#147;relevant&#148; offences. This brings them into line with the other provisions in the order by allowing the FSA to take all convictions into account.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000089"></a>The following amendments have been included following the Bichard inquiry&#146;s recommendations. Article 7 of this order makes a number of additions to the list to include: people in the Department for Education and Skills, the Office for Standards in Education, children&#146;s services and skills in the government offices for the English regions working in sensitive posts relating to children or vulnerable adults; operators and users of ContactPoint, which is a database containing basic information about children in England aged up to 18, such as their name, date of birth, address, and contact details of parent or carer, GP practice, educational setting, health visitor, and so on; persons giving advice to children over the telephone or other form of electronic communication including the internet and mobile telephone text messaging; and the chairman, members, and members of staff of the Independent Barring Board. The Independent Barring Board has not yet been established at the date of coming into force of this order, but this exception will apply to prospective appointments to the board.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000090"></a>The first provision, relating to staff in the Department for Education and Skills, was drafted before recent changes in Whitehall. We will take the necessary action to ensure that it applies to the relevant people, although they will in future be working in new departments.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000091"></a>Several other changes are also being made in the order. They will affect: staff working within the Public Guardianship Office with access to data relating to children and vulnerable adults; the Commissioner for Older People in Wales, his deputy, and any person appointed by the commissioner to assist him or authorised to discharge his functions on his behalf. This is a new position which has been created under the Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Act 2006; the commissioners for the Gambling Commission and any office or employment in their service. This is in accordance with the power granted to them under the Gambling Act 2005; individuals seeking authorisation from the Secretary of State at the Home Department to become authorised search officers. This was a ministerial commitment given during the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act 2006; and anyone in employment where normal duties involve caring for, training, supervising, or being solely in charge of, persons aged under 18 serving in the Armed Forces and anyone in employment where normal duties include supervising personnel aged under 18. This provision follows the recommendation made by the Deepcut review in March 2006.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000092"></a>We believe that these amendments are necessary in order to maintain a proper balance between the needs of vulnerable groups for protection, the necessity of maintaining the integrity of our regulatory and public bodies and the benefit to society of rehabilitating ex-offenders through employment. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

I thank him for his explanation of what the order sets out to do. As he made clear, we have already had two amending orders in 2006. I think that he mentioned two more in the five years before that, and no doubt a number of orders were made between 1974 and 2001. In an era when the Prime Minister is talking about change, change and change again, it strikes me that an awful lot of changes are happening. It might be useful for the Government to introduce some consolidation of all this so that we know exactly where we are in terms of all the exceptions to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. It is a very worthy Act in itself but it is beginning to look as though there might be more exceptions than in the original Act, particularly, as the noble Lord made clear, further amendments will have to be introduced pretty soon. Although the Government tried to make sure that they did not have to amend parts of it too often by including boards that did not yet exist, in the form of the Independent Barring Board, they also

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000095"></a>He mentioned that there would be further changes following the Bichard report, but I should be grateful if he would consider introducing consolidation to clarify the situation for practitioners and to enable people to know exactly what is and is not excluded.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000096"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071062000308"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> Because this came within the purview of the Ministry of Justice only in May this year it is necessary to make some points of principle on the order. In relation to offenders the basic policy must be to ensure, and as much as possible to encourage, their rehabilitation and resettlement. The whole purpose of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 was to make it clear that after a certain period a person could have closure to offences that had been committed so that he did not have to reveal a previous conviction, or admit its existence, once the conviction was spent. During my time as a criminal lawyer I have seen the benefits of that provision, but as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, said a moment ago, we seem to be getting more exceptions to protection than those who are protected by the Act.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000097"></a>I remind the Committee of statistics that were produced by the Office for National Statistics in connection with the report, <I>Breaking the Circle</I>, which pointed out at appendix E that these statistics were available. At the NACRO conference on key issues in prisoners&#146; resettlement in March 2002, Paul Cavadino, who is well known to Members of the Committee in this field, said that there were,</p>
<ul><a name="07071062000270"></a>&#147;disproportionately high rates of unemployment amongst those sent to prison&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000244"></a>and that&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07071062000271"></a>&#147;more than two thirds of the prison population&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000245"></a>were unemployed when they committed their offence.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000246"></a>Sixty per cent of ex-offenders are refused jobs because of their criminal record, although ex-prisoners with jobs are one-third to one-half less likely to reoffend.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000098"></a>There are statistics from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research concerning the barriers to employment for offenders and ex-offenders. It found that many people with a criminal record expect employers to react negatively when they learn of their previous convictions and are therefore deterred from even applying for a job. Its conclusion was that any kind of criminal record results in a likely rejection of an application for about one in six vacancies, but with most types of offences, there is a rejection rate of about one-half of vacancies.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000099"></a>I cite those statistics to remind the Committee that disclosure of a criminal record that would otherwise be spent is a very serious inhibitor to an employer to employ anyone. The cycle is maintained: the person without a job goes out to commit more offences and goes back to prison. The purpose of the original Act was to try to break that circle. The Rowntree Foundation report was also cited in the appendix to which I referred. It is very important not to take lightly the addition of exceptions. For example, one wonders why it is necessary to have a particular requirement for the  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC200"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>new Commissioner for Older People in Wales as a single, very important job, to disclose previous convictions. It is highly unlikely that a person who had been to prison would apply for a job of that nature.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000100"></a>The temptation to add to the list of exceptions goes on and on. Of course, we on these Benches support the essential necessity of protecting children and vulnerable people, but I want to draw to the Committee's attention how making too many exceptions can lead to a continuation of the problems from which people suffer and can result in further imprisonment. A previous regime, which has fortunately now departed from the Home Office, was anxious always to lock more people up, to the point where the jails are bursting and to do that even when the rate of offending was significantly reducing. That regime has gone and I hope that under the new Ministry of Justice we will see a broader approach to those problems and that the exceptions to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 will be much fewer and far between.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000101"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071062000309"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> I apologise for arriving late for the start of consideration of the order. I had thought that discussion of the gambling order would go on rather longer than it did.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000102"></a>Have organisations working for the rehabilitation and resettlement of offenders being consulted about the terms of the order? It is important that they should have been, but I am not certain that they were, whereas the Explanatory Memorandum states that employers&#146; organisations or groups have been consulted. There seems to be a slight disparity there.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000103"></a>Secondly, I understand that there should be concern about employment categories for people dealing with children and young people. One might expect that previous convictions for offences against children, specifically, would tend to disqualify from employment. But why should all convictions have that effect? In that context, do convictions for violent crime against persons carry special weight?</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000104"></a>Finally, does disclosure of previous convictions, particularly if they occurred some years ago and therefore are remote from the present time, still allow the job application to be considered?</p>

<p><a name="07071062000105"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07071062000310"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords for their comments on this order. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked: why not simply overhaul and consolidate the exceptions order? We intend to take that step to coincide with the launch of the new vetting and barring scheme in the autumn of 2008. The exception order will be aligned with the provisions of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000106"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, made a fascinating contribution to the debate. It is very difficult to disagree with anything he said. He said that we should encourage rehabilitation and resettlement in relation to <I>B</I><I>reak</I><I>ing</I><I> the </I><I>C</I><I>ircle</I>. There is a temptation, he argued, with these orders simply to keep adding. The important point about the order is that it is aimed at protecting children and vulnerable adults. Although we take on board his legitimate concerns, we are very mindful, as I am sure he is, to protect the principle of  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC201"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rehabilitation. However, we have to balance the needs of protection, in particular with children, especially in the light of the Bichard report which followed on the terrible events in Soham. The points made by the noble Lord are very well taken, but we cannot take any risks with our children or vulnerable adults. This presents a problem, which we have to continue discussing, because if you have offended against children, it is very difficult to imagine circumstances in which you should be allowed to work with children again. At the same time, you are then dealing with a group of people who perhaps stand no chance of getting another job, which comes back to a very important point the noble Lord made.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, also asked why it was necessary to put in the order about the Commissioner for Older People in Wales. The role of the commissioner is likely to involve significant unsupervised contact with and indirect access to potentially a large number of older people in the normal course of his or her duties. This is an innovative post which will be the focus of attention and scrutiny at the highest level. It is therefore imperative that risks are not taken, no matter how small.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked what Nacro&#146;s response was to the proposed amendments. We engaged in a very useful dialogue with Nacro. For example, it expressed concerns that the exception order needed to draw a balance between the rights of ex-offenders and the need to protect vulnerable groups; we have already discussed that matter. We feel that this order strikes that balance very well.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000109"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, also asked whether disclosure of previous convictions still allows job applications to be considered. It is a matter for the employer as to what they do, if any weight is to be given to such disclosures. Employers are encouraged to have a policy for the employment of ex-offenders. Amendments were made to the exception order as a result of these discussions. I commend the order.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000112"></a>The noble Lord said: The order applies to judges and magistrates sitting at the North Liverpool Community Justice Centre and the Community Justice Courts in the courts named in the order and is subject to affirmative resolution, by virtue of Section 330(5) of the Criminal Justice Act.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000113"></a>Section 178 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides an order-making power for a court to review periodically offenders&#146; progress on community orders. This power was enacted for the first community justice courts in Liverpool and Salford on a pilot basis and has been in operation in those courts since  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC202"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>April 2006. Article 2 of the order empowers the specified courts to provide for a court review either at the time of making a community order and/or when amending a community order to include or remove a provision for review.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000114"></a>A community order providing for review may provide for the community order to be reviewed periodically at specified intervals; require the offender to attend each review hearing; and provide for a report on the offender&#146;s progress in complying with the order to be made available to the court before each review. The community justice initiative involves the courts engaging with the local community and working in partnership with criminal justice agencies, local authorities, support services, community groups and the wider voluntary sector to solve the problems caused by offending in the local area.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000115"></a>The review of community orders supports the delivery of key principles of community justice. Reviewing offenders&#146; progress enables the court to maintain oversight of an offender and increases the offender&#146;s accountability to the court. It also offers the court and support agencies involved further opportunities to support the offender in complying with their order by addressing problems, such as housing or financial difficulties. The review process does not involve significant resource, particularly given the potential savings associated with decreased breach and reoffending.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000116"></a>As the power has only been in force in Liverpool and Salford since April 2006, and given that reoffending data need to measured over at least two years, we do not yet have quantitative data available. Our next step will therefore be to carry out a full evaluation with more offenders using a comparison sample of offenders with similar characteristics. Furthermore, this extension of the power to review community orders to the new pilot community justice schemes will provide further data on which to base this.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000117"></a>There is, however, already strong evidence from his honour Judge Fletcher, the magistrates in Salford and from offenders themselves that the review process is a powerful mechanism for increasing compliance and enforcement of community sentences. Some examples of the impact that review has had on offenders include a young offender with a history of anti-social behaviour, unemployment, depression and drug abuse who received a suspended sentence with onerous conditions in March 2006. His progress was reviewed regularly by the judge and he successfully completed all unpaid community hours and probation accredited programmes. Another example is a long-term drug addict who&#151;again after regular review&#151;has not only succeeded in beating his addiction but has been promoted to a position of responsibility in the hostel he is living in and has begun to have contact with his family again.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000118"></a>An offender interviewed about the review process said, &#147;I would have gone off the rails and that was what I needed, that short leash. That is why I got my life back in order&#148;.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000119"></a>In Liverpool, review sessions have been used to engage offenders in discussions about their plans for the future and to refer them to Jobcentre Plus. For many offenders, this is the first time that such a sustained interest has been shown in their lives,

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000120"></a>In November 2006, my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton announced that community justice was to be expanded to 11 new areas. The order would extend the power to review community courts to those new projects, which have all enthusiastically asked to be given the opportunity to use the power as part of their projects.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000121"></a>The review of community orders is key to community justice. Extending the power to review community orders to the new projects will enable them to support and monitor offenders during their sentence, to reassess the effectiveness of a community order, and to vary it if required. It will enable them to refer offenders, particularly those with a wide range of needs, to appropriate support services. It also sends a message to the community and the offender that community sentences are not a soft option. It is intended that the review process will promote compliance with community orders and prevent reoffending. The extension of the power will also enable a robust evaluation of the operation of the review process, and its effect on compliance and reoffending rates tied in with an in depth review of the impact on reoffending in Liverpool. The results of this evaluation will inform future decisions about the wider roll-out of the power.</p>

It strikes me as an order which would have been far better if it had been left as a negative instrument rather than an affirmative one. I do not think that I was involved during the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. As often as not, concessions are made by Ministers&#151;normally allowing an order to become affirmative when previously it was negative. This is probably one of those occasions when, if that were the case, it would have been wiser for the Minister to have resisted calls from the Opposition to make it affirmative.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC204"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pilot. First, how often did the courts find it useful to review the community order? Was it on a monthly, six-monthly or three-monthly basis, or what? Secondly, are there are sufficient resources for, for example, the production of reports by the Probation Service? I know only too well how hard pressed it is, and I can imagine that having to produce a review report more frequently than every six or 12 months would be a considerable burden. Thirdly, one of the ideas behind the whole principle of the order was that it would cut down on breach proceedings. Has that happened in Liverpool and Salford? Have there been fewer breach proceedings than in the past as a percentage of the orders that were made?</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000127"></a>The issue is still rather tentative. The pilots have operated for a period in two courts. The whole system then comes to an end and a new pilot for 12 court centres comes forward. It smacks of a lack of any positive conclusions drawn from the original pilots in Salford and in Liverpool. I would like to hear more about the results.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000128"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07071062000314"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> I note the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Henley. I agree with him that perhaps we should debate less than we do. This being a positive order has given us the opportunity to discuss it. The general answer to the point of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is that, as I said in my opening speech, there is a large amount of anecdotal evidence that the system is working well. There will now be a more formal review. We have every hope, as do the local people, that it will show that these are very positive and good initiatives in the local community.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000129"></a>The noble Lord asked specifically how often reviews take place. In Liverpool and in Salford, how regularly cases are reviewed has been at the discretion of the court. Firmer guidance is being prepared with NOMS, which will cover the regularity of reviews. That will be made available for the new courts prior to the introduction of the order. He also asked whether the impact on probation resources has been considered. The proposal to extend the power to review community orders on a pilot basis had the full agreement of NOMS. Negotiations have taken place locally within the projects to ensure that the probation services and the courts can cope with the additional burden of the review hearings in preparation for them. A small amount of funding will be provided by NOMS, by the community justice programme, to cover the additional cost.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000130"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, asked whether this provision has cut down on breach proceedings. Again, anecdotal evidence from staff is that there has been a reduction in breach proceedings. Only a small number of offenders have so far been subject to reviews, so we cannot at this moment draw robust conclusions. Returning to generality, there is a very strong feeling in Liverpool and Salford that this initiative is a very good thing and has had very positive results; but I absolutely take on board the point the noble Lord made that there must be a robust review that demonstrates that it is indeed working. I commend the order.</p>

<h5><a name="07071062000286"></a>4.59 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07071062000132"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07071062000315"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 (Amendment) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000133"></a>The noble Lord said: The order, which was laid before the House on 21 May, seeks to make some minor changes to Schedule 6 to the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 for the purpose of clarifying the &#147;trigger offences&#148; applicable to the testing of persons for the presence of specified class A drugs, currently heroin and cocaine. The changes arise from omissions in the consequential amendments made to Schedule 6 by the Fraud Act 2006, which came into effect on 15 January this year.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000134"></a>As part of its reform of the law on fraud, the Fraud Act repealed and replaced the existing array of &#147;deception&#148; offences, including the offence of obtaining property by deception under Section 15 of the Theft Act 1968, one of the trigger offences set out in Schedule 6. The reference to the offence of obtaining property by deception was consequently repealed and omitted from paragraph 1 in Schedule 6 as a trigger offence, and the general offence of fraud, under Section 1 of the Fraud Act, was added to the list of trigger offences in its place. Although slightly broader in scope, inclusion of the offence of fraud was necessary to capture the offending previously caught by the repealed offence.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70710-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000135"></a>Unfortunately, those consequential amendments failed to take account of previous additions to Schedule 6 relating to attempted offences, and because of that oversight, failed to remove a reference to the attempted offence of obtaining property by deception and to provide for an attempted offence of fraud in its place. The order seeks to correct and clarify those omissions by substituting a new paragraph in Schedule 6 in respect of attempted offences, as set out in Article 2 of the order. While the changes are largely technical, they are nevertheless important and necessary from both a legal and practical perspective.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000136"></a>The trigger offences set out in Schedule 6, especially those relating to acquisitive crime, are the offences which have been shown by research to have the clearest link with the misuse of class A drugs, particularly heroin and cocaine, which are the drugs that cause the most harm to users and the community. These offences trigger the drug testing of persons in police detention under Section 63B of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 as part of the drug interventions programme. Under the programme, persons arrested for or charged with a trigger offence are tested to help to identify those who misuse specified class A drugs. The individuals who test positive can then go on to be assessed and to access appropriate treatment and other support.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000137"></a>It is estimated that the inclusion of attempted fraud as a trigger offence could result in just under 1,200 tests being conducted in police detention in respect of that offence each year. That takes into  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC206"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>account numbers tested for the offence of attempted obtaining property by deception and an estimated 230 extra tests resulting from the slightly broader scope of the offence of attempted fraud.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000138"></a>The trigger offences are also relevant in circumstances where persons who are released on licence or under a notice of supervision following a custodial sentence for a trigger offence may be given a drug testing requirement as part of their licence conditions or notice. The relevant provisions are Section 64 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 and Section 65 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Currently, the provisions are targeted at prolific and priority offenders who are known drug users who may revert to drug use on release. Monitoring their behaviour in this way helps to ensure that those who test positive can receive appropriate support and treatment. The number of persons released from custody who may be affected by the addition of attempted fraud as a trigger offence is expected to be very small. Nevertheless, its inclusion as a trigger offence will ensure that, where appropriate, a drug testing requirement can be applied as part of a condition of licence in the case of those released from a sentence of attempted fraud. With regard to any additional costs arising from the inclusion of attempted fraud as a trigger offence, we anticipate that they will be minimal and can be absorbed within existing capacity.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000139"></a>Trigger offences and the drug testing arrangements to which they relate play an important part in helping to identify and direct drug misusing offenders into treatment and other support. That is reflected in the fall in recorded acquisitive crime which, since the onset of the drug interventions programme, has fallen by some 20 per cent. The order clarifies the trigger offences applicable for drug testing. I therefore commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000140"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 (Amendment) Order 2007. <I>19th report from the Statutory Instruments Committee</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Bassam of Brighton</I>.)</p>

As the Explanatory Memorandum puts it and as the Minister explains, the purpose of the order is to correct some omissions in the consequential amendments made by the Fraud Act 2006 and so on. The order seeks&#151;I noticed that the Minister said &#147;seeks&#148;&#151;to correct those omissions. I hope that he has got it right for once. The only point that I want to make is one that I have made before. I believe that we have had some 62 pieces of primary legislation from the Home Office since 1997, compared with something like 50 in the previous century. Presumably we have had far more statutory instruments than that. Will the Minister let me know how many statutory instruments have emanated from the Home Office over the years? As I and others have made clear, it is that enormous number of orders and other pieces of legislation from the Home Office that has led to mistakes and is likely to lead to further mistakes, so perhaps a period of silence  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC207"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from the Home Office would be no bad thing to allow some things to bed down and to prevent it from making yet more mistakes. I therefore hope that the Minister has got it right on this occasion. I also hope that he can confirm the figures that I gave and give some estimate of the number of statutory instruments that have come out of the Home Office.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000142"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071062000317"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> I do not think that the Home Office knows the meaning of the word &#147;silence&#148;. This is simply another burden on practitioners and judges, who are for ever having to cope with new legislation that demands their attention, and very often with further instruction from the Home Office as to what the various criminal justice Acts and the subordinate legislation which those Acts spawn actually mean.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000143"></a>The purpose of the order is, as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, has said, to put right something that was omitted in the original legislation. The point about a trigger offence is that it enables the police to test someone on arrest, even though no connection with a class A drug is suspected when the offence for which they have been arrested is committed. If a person is subject to a trigger offence, it can be made a condition of his release that he subjects himself to drug testing, again although there was no connection with a drug when the offence was committed. Young offenders who are released from a term of detention are subject to supervision and can be called on to be tested, again without there having been any connection with a drug when the offence was committed. The police do, of course, have considerable powers to do all these things where there is reasonable suspicion of drugs being involved. The difference between trigger offences and ordinary offences is therefore that trigger offences will bring about all this testing without any need to establish drugs as part of the particular offence.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000144"></a>Here we have a provision that will allow the police to test someone when attempted fraud is alleged. Under the new Act, fraud is not merely a slightly broader offence than obtaining property by deception but a hugely broader offence. These greater powers are being given to the police, both on arrest and at later stages, without any consideration that it may be more appropriate to carry out testing only where drugs are thought to be involved. We must protest about this continuous encroaching on the right of privacy and the right to freedom that we all have. We do not oppose the regulation but, as I have said on previous occasions, we want to put down a warning that there must be some limit on the continual widening of the powers against offenders.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000145"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071062000318"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords for their comments. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, is, I guess, right to tease us for getting something wrong, but it is perhaps only fair to remind the noble Lord that that is a drafting issue, not an issue of principle. The noble Lord may well be right about the number of Home Office pieces of legislation since 1997; I do not have a precise figure in front of me. His other figure for what had happened in the previous century was probably a bit more speculative. No doubt that data can be interrogated somewhere.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC208"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000146"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord is also right to say that, as a consequence of having put on the statute book more Acts, there are bound to be more statutory instruments. That is the nature of legislation. We as an Administration, as a Government, believe that crime and criminality is very serious and want to tackle it. We do not claim that there is a magic bullet in every piece of legislation ever brought forward that will finally tackle the problem; we have to be persistent in finding ways to deal with those issues, which are of profound importance to our society. I make no apology for the fact we find it necessary from time to time to bring forward new legislative initiatives.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000147"></a>I sometimes have some sympathy with the plea that we should have a little less legislation, not just for personal reasons but because it is important that legislation on the statute book is workable and effective. The noble Lord makes a good point when he says that sometimes we should leave things to bed down. I do not disagree with the thinking behind that.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000148"></a>However, this is an important piece of legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, seems to take exception to it on the grounds that it is yet another extension of police powers of intervention. I would say that this is a benign power because, if someone tests positive for a class A drug, they are then very likely to receive treatment. The Government have proudly trumpeted our record in expanding the range of treatments available for known drugs offenders and for those who indulge in acquisitive crime&#151;that is what the schedule of crimes relates to&#151;which is very much linked with drug abuse. The rate of positive testing for those who have been tested under similar powers runs at between 16 and 19 per cent. So there is good thinking behind this, because those people may well end up being referred to a drug treatment programme. I cannot believe that that is other than beneficial generally.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000149"></a>Those are the reasons why we favour this secondary legislation. The amendments will clarify the position with regard to trigger offences. That will assist practitioners, especially police and probation staff and especially those who have responsibility for conducting drug testing.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000152"></a>The noble Lord said: This is now the fifth order that we have brought forward adding countries to the list of those countries to which the non-suspensive appeal provisions in Section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 apply. This section allows the Secretary of State to add a country to the list if he or she is satisfied that in general there is no serious risk of persecution of persons entitled to reside there and that removal to that country of  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC209"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>persons entitled to reside there will not in general breach the United Kingdom&#146;s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. It also provides that an unsuccessful asylum or human rights claim made by a person entitled to reside in a designated state must be certified as clearly unfounded, unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that the claim is not clearly unfounded. The effect of such a certificate is that a person must leave the United Kingdom before appealing the decision to refuse their claim, while still having an out-of-country right of appeal.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000153"></a>Since their introduction, powers to add countries to the list have been used on a progressive basis to ensure that the provisions work well and are successful in stopping people making unfounded applications for asylum and unnecessarily prolonging the appeals process. The evidence to date on the 14 countries already on the list demonstrates that this is indeed the case and that the powers have made a significant impact on reducing the number of asylum applicants from those countries. For example, the intake of new applications from the countries that were designated in the 2002 Act&#151;the then 10 EU accession countries&#151;fell by 86 per cent over the first six months in which the provisions were in place and by 93 per cent over the course of the first year. Between the powers being introduced in October 2002 and April 2004, when the countries concerned became members of the EU, and the non-suspensive appeals designation effectively ended, intake fell by 97 per cent, with the overall intake during that period falling by 70 per cent.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000154"></a>There was a similar drop in intake for the countries that were added to the list on 1 April 2003, namely Albania, Jamaica, Macedonia, Moldova and Serbia and Montenegro. In those countries, intake fell by 86 per cent from March 2003 to March 2007, with overall intake during that period falling by 57 per cent. The figures include Montenegro, which was effectively removed from the list on 3 June 2006 following the dissolution of the old state union between it and Serbia. Noble Lords will be aware that statistics supplied in respect of asylum claims from Montenegro, as an addendum to the explanatory memorandum to the draft order, combine the number of claims from Montenegro and Serbia together. We have now extrapolated the figures for Montenegro, which we will supply to Members at a later date, if and when required.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000155"></a>For countries that were added to the list on 23 July 2003&#151;namely, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, South Africa and Ukraine&#151;intake fell by 61 per cent from June 2003 to March 2007, with the overall intake during that period falling by 48 per cent. Those figures exclude Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, which were also added to the list on 23 July 2003, but were removed on 22 April 2005 and 13 December 2006 respectively. With regard to India, which was added to the list on 15 February 2005, intake fell by 52 per cent from March of that year to March 2007, with the overall intake during that period falling by 13 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000156"></a>For Mongolia and&#151;for men only&#151;for Nigeria and Ghana, which were added to the list on 2  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC210"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>December 2005, intake fell by 34 per cent from December of that year to March 2007, with overall intake during that period falling by 5 per cent.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000157"></a>The figures speak for themselves. In terms of the decision-making process for considering an asylum or human rights claim from a resident of a designated country, each claim is given full and proper consideration on its individual merits by a fully trained caseworker. Applicants are entitled to legal aid and advice as part of the process, and the right of appeal against any refusal decision, albeit from outside the country. Failsafes, in addition to those already in place for asylum claims from those not entitled to reside in designated countries, are built into the process. They include senior caseworker approval for each and every decision, thus ensuring the integrity of the decision-making process, and judicial review of decisions certified as clearly unfounded where an applicant believes that their case was wrongly certified.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000158"></a>As a result of this process, we have been able to remove from the United Kingdom individuals whose asylum claims were established to be unfounded and who have diverted resources away from processing the claims of those in genuine need of international protection. In view of the successful operation of the provisions thus far, we have decided that the time is now right for us to add a further 10 countries to the list. The draft order would, first, add Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mauritius, Montenegro and Peru to the list, and, secondly, add Gambia, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali and Sierra Leone in respect of men only. It would also make a technical amendment regarding the designation of Serbia. The old state union of Serbia and Montenegro was designated in April 2003. Following the dissolution of the old state union, Serbia remained designated, albeit under the words &#147;Serbia and Montenegro&#148; as it was the successor state to the old state union. The amendment to the list would therefore reflect that Serbia and Montenegro are now two separate states and should be listed separately.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000159"></a>The assessment as to whether a particular country meets the test for designation is not simply based on the number of applications received from people entitled to reside in that country or the percentage of those applications which are unsuccessful. Rather, we instead consider the general conditions for the population in the country itself, not the profile of claimants who have made applications to the UK. Broadly speaking, we would look to see what evidence there is of persecution or human rights breaches within a country and how widespread such treatment is. In considering the 10 countries listed in the draft order, we took carefully into account our published country of origin information material which utilises a wide range of recognised and publicly disclosable governmental and non-governmental sources. We also consulted the independent Advisory Panel on Country Information on that material.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000160"></a>I should briefly remind the Committee that the Advisory Panel on Country Information is an independent body created under the 2002 Act to advise the Secretary of State on the accuracy and objectivity of country information produced by the Home Office in the context of asylum applications. During the passage of  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC211"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC211</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the 2002 Act, Ministers gave clear assurances that the panel would be consulted on country material being used by the Home Office before making an order to designate a country. The panel&#146;s role in the country designation process is solely to consider the country of origin information material. It has no power to comment on the decision whether or not to designate. The panel considered the country of origin information produced on the 10 countries produced in the draft order at its recent meeting and found it to be generally an accurate, balanced and comprehensive representation of the source material and country conditions. Following the panel&#146;s advice, additional information was added or amendments made as appropriate. The extension to the list to include these countries is not to say that they are totally safe for everyone. What we are saying is that we are satisfied that Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mauritius, Montenegro and Peru meet the test for designation in full, and that Gambia, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali and Sierra Leone meet the test for designation, but for men only at the present time. In the countries where we are proposing partial designation, the evidence suggests that women may in general be at risk for a variety of reasons, which may include a risk of female genital mutilation, trafficking, domestic violence and forced marriage, and that currently the level of protection provided by the authorities is not sufficient to conclude that the test for designation is satisfied in respect of women.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000161"></a>The draft order represents a gradual increase and progressive use of the powers under the 2002 Act and builds on the programme to reform our asylum and immigration system. At the same time, we continue to ensure that we do not deny legitimate claims the right to a proper hearing and that we provide a safe haven for those in genuine need of international protection. I therefore commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000166"></a>I propose to outline some of those concerns. Of Liberia, Human Rights Watch said:</p>

<p><a name="07071062000247"></a>continues to rise&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07071062000272"></a>&#147;including hijacking, armed robbery, and murder&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000248"></a>The report states that the newly trained Liberian police engage in criminal behaviour by using excessive force and even sexual harassment. The performance of the judiciary remains dysfunctional, with corrupt practices being carried out. Prison centres operate far below international standards, with overcrowded cells and a lack of food and water for detainees; and harmful traditional practices continue to be carried out, which include the killing of alleged witches and the killing of people who refuse to be induced into an alleged secret society. Liberia is not a safe place to which to return people, as the order proposes.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000167"></a>Of Sierra Leone, in respect of men, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Oxfam say that since the end of Sierra Leone&#146;s brutal armed conflict in 2002, few improvements have been made to address the crushing poverty and human rights violations that are occurring. Sierra Leone has been placed on the white list in respect of men only&#151;the problems regarding women and children need to be addressed&#151;but men are still suffering human rights violations with regard to corruption, where they are being arrested, beaten and forced into societies in which they are forced to perform female genital mutilation. There is no record of their arrests. Sierra Leone has been a matter of concern for this country for some time. It has not yet qualified as a safe place in the submission of those organisations, which are in the front line.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000168"></a>As for Peru, armed conflict ended in 2000, but Peru has yet to establish a stable democracy. Cases of torture and police brutality continue to occur and victims and witnesses in torture cases are vulnerable to intimidation and reprisals. Journalists who report on corruption in Peru face harassment and physical attack.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000169"></a>In Serbia, according to Human Rights Watch there is still an unsatisfactory human rights situation in 2007. The Roma continue to face substandard economic and social conditions, as well as frequent verbal and physical abuse. In Kosovo, minorities remain at risk from persecution and attack. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported in 2006 that Serbs, Roma and Albanians from a minority area are still at a high risk of being persecuted. Then there is Bosnia-Herzegovina. Despite the war ending in 1993, 14 years ago, the main human rights threat that remains is the return of refugees and displaced people. Those who return to areas in which they are the minority remain under threat of physical attack and harassment; and human rights groups in Bosnia fear that, if all the refugees return, they may be persecuted and face torture.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000170"></a>Amnesty International also comments on other countries in the list. In the Gambia, 70 civilians and members of the military, including prisoners of conscience were unlawfully detained after an alleged coup attempt in late March 2006. Several journalists and editors were also unlawfully detained for many weeks. At least 12 detainees were reportedly tortured. Trials of suspected coup plotters were continuing in military and civilian courts at the end of the year. Five people who allegedly

<p><a name="07071062000171"></a>Amnesty also says that the Government of Kenya have intensified their intimidation and harassment of journalists and human rights defenders. Impunity for abuses by the police was reinforced, as the authorities failed to investigate allegations of police brutality. Violence against women and girls, including rape and domestic violence, remains a serious concern. All the conditions of an absolutely unacceptable regime are present where the police do not do their job, do not arrest people and are guilty of brutality that is never investigated.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000172"></a>Amnesty says that almost 1 million people in Malawi needed food aid in 2006. Freedom of expression continues to be threatened, with a number of media workers charged with criminal libel. Torture and ill treatment by police and life-threatening prison conditions were reported. In June 2006, the Malawi Human Rights Commission expressed concern about abuse and torture at Lilongwe, Kawale, Lingadzi and Kanengo police stations.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000173"></a>Montenegro, which declared independence from Serbia, was recognised as a United Nations member state in June 2006. Some progress has been made, but it still has impunity for some war crimes and political killings. Torture and ill treatment by law enforcement officers were widespread throughout 2006. Only Mali and Mauritius, which appear on the list, have not elicited the concern of Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000174"></a>It remains the case that we should have a proper appeals system that works as a safeguard for people from these countries. The decisions that are taken to turn them back are very often successfully appealed. Accordingly, we must express our deep concern about the extension that the order initiates.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000175"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071062000322"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> I notice that for six African states listed in the order, the designation applies only to men. I see that women should continue to be protected because of female genital mutilation and possibly honour killings, both of which can give rise to fears of persecution. Have the Government examined the criminal codes to see whether same-sex attractions and sexual acts are crimes in each of the six states? What is the current practice under customary or religious law in these countries? Is there the illegal or de facto persecution of homosexuals? I am prompted to ask these questions by knowledge of a particular asylum case in Britain involving someone from Cameroon. The applicant was a young man who had suffered attacks from his parents and neighbours because of his homosexuality. He was later sent to prison at home because homosexuality was penalised by Cameroon&#146;s criminal code. The situation could well be similar in other African states, including the six named.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000176"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071062000323"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> Following what the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, has just said, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, may remember that I mentioned the persecution of gays the last time we debated a list of designated  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC214"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>states. I pointed out then that the powers in Section 94(4) of the parent Act visualise the Secretary of State designating particular countries with respect to characteristics of asylum seekers from those places that are wider than gender. Did the noble Lord take advice on the question of gays from the African countries in the list, and has he considered whether they should be designated only for people who are heterosexual? I believe that it is time for us to confront these practices and to make sure that people not just from Cameroon are protected, where I agree there is a particular problem. I know this myself and I endorse entirely what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. Violent prejudice against homosexuals is endemic in many African countries. Given that the powers exist in Section 94, they should be used to exclude homosexuals from the non-suspensive appeals process which is applied to the rest of the population in those countries.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000177"></a>I hope that the noble Lord has had an adequate opportunity to consider this since I did raise it on the last occasion when we considered an order of this sort. It is a general application not just to the countries on this list, but to many which are already included from past designations. I am thinking particularly of Nigeria, Ghana and Jamaica, which were the three countries I referred to on the previous occasion. In fact, the Minister is quite right that the country of origin material has improved enormously. I have paid tribute to this in the past, and to the work of the independent advisory panel. Generally speaking, one finds that the country reports contain comprehensive lists of the material referred to by my noble friend. All the Amnesty reports and Human Rights Watch material will be included in the country of origin material. Listening to what the Minister told noble Lords, one can only say that it is a wonder that the decision was made to designate those countries in view not just of the wealth of material that comes from Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, but also the fact that it is explicitly recognised in the Home Office&#146;s own country of origin information material and in the work of the advisory panel which validates the reports. I wonder at the sort of process which allows one to get from consideration of a particular country by the Home Office to produce the country of origin report and the decision to designate. That is what is lacking in our discussion. We know what criticisms have been made and that the information exists in the Home Office&#146;s internal reports, but we cannot connect the knowledge of that material with the decision to designate. That is something which the Minister has still to explain.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000178"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071062000324"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, for his generous support of the order. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for his comments. They reflect fairly that this is a process which has to be looked at in the round. It is one where we take a view and have to make a judgment call. As I said in my comments at the outset, we do not say that these countries are 100 per cent safe&#151;indeed, that cannot be said of any country. The noble Lord cited various categories of serious criminality, but those things also happen in what we consider to be civilised western democracies. Obviously we do not want them to happen, so we take the steps and measures we should as a society to  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC215"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tackle them through legal process, and that is right. We also attempt to encourage such action abroad and to use our influence in that regard. We are saying that in general there is no serious risk of persecution and that removal would not breach our obligations under the ECHR. Further, it is the case that the protection needs of individual claimants continue to be assessed quite properly on a case by case basis regardless of the designation.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000179"></a>I turn to the more general issue of human rights problems. There has to be a test and we think that these countries meet that test in respect of the designation we have made for each of them. Again, there is an exclusion for certain of the African states where only males are only properly considered. That is right and reflects the content of the country reports we have compiled. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is also right to draw attention to the high quality of those reports. It might be argued that they do not necessarily help the Government&#146;s case, but they reflect our honest approach and clear appraisal which we think is the right way to proceed. We as Ministers made a commitment to Parliament that the independent Advisory Panel on Country Information would be consulted on the country information being used by the Government before we make an order. That consideration has been made and the general view is that it is balanced, accurate and comprehensive. The Advisory Panel on Country Information highlighted other materials, some of which were referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000180"></a>Further on human rights problems, all I can say is that the general test is applied when considering whether a country meets the legal test of designation. Designation of a particular country does not mean that all claims from that country will be refused or certified as clearly unfounded. Claims will continue to be considered individually and there may well be cases where there is a grant of asylum or where humanitarian protection or discretionary leave to remain is appropriate. There may also be cases where asylum is refused, but certification as clearly unfounded is not appropriate.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000181"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to same-sex relationships. These issues are considered for all potential at-risk groups in assessing whether such a significant proportion of the population is at risk that the designation test is not met. That is the judgment which has to be made in those cases. Looking through the country information assessment, one can see where it is clearly the case. For some of the countries on the list, the comments make it clear that there is legislation one way or the other. A judgment then has to be made on whether there is persecution based on the existence of same-sex relationships. We believe that our list is sound and safe to operate in the way I have described. For those reasons, that is why this order has been put before the Committee for its consideration.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC216"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it has considered the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000184"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, these regulations replace the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000, as amended, and they will be made under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which went through your Lordships&#146; House earlier this year.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000185"></a>The Act represents the most important achievement in animal welfare legislation for over a century. It brings together and modernises the range of existing animal welfare legislation relating to farmed and non-farmed animals. It came into force in April. As part of the rationalisation, Part 1 of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968, under which existing farm animal welfare legislation has been made, will be repealed, as relevant provisions have been incorporated into the Animal Welfare Act. To preserve the requirements of existing secondary farm-animal welfare legislation, we have had to bring forward these replacement regulations under the new Act.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000186"></a>For many years, farmed animals have been protected by the duty of care. The Animal Welfare Act introduces a duty of care for owners of all vertebrate animals, including, for the first time, pet animals. Previously, people had a duty to ensure that their animals did not suffer. Now, in addition, owners of animals must do all that is reasonable to ensure the welfare of their animals, with respect to, for example, diet, housing and the ability to express normal behaviour. In addition, the Animal Welfare Act gives enforcement bodies the ability to issue improvement notices to the owners of pet animals, which is a tool that has been used for many years to help improve the welfare of farmed animals. Improvement notices will help to explain clearly the steps needed to rectify welfare problems and a definite time limit to achieve that improvement.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000187"></a>The Animal Welfare Act has an important role in allowing secondary legislation to be made under it; specific laws which will help protect animals in addition to the protective framework of the Act. One such piece of legislation is the Mutilations (Permitted Procedures) (England) Regulations 2007. The mutilation of animals is banned under the Act, and the regulations set out the limited circumstances in which mutilations are permitted and under what conditions. We debated those regulations earlier this year. The replacement on-farm welfare regulations before us today are also secondary legislation to be made under the Animal Welfare Act. The vast majority of the new regulations replicate the 2000 regulations. They continue to implement EU directives on the welfare of calves, pigs, laying hens and a general framework directive&#151;98/58/EC&#151;which sets down minimum standards for the protection of all farmed livestock.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000188"></a>One change from the 2000 regulations, arising from the fact that the Animal Welfare Act covers all animals under the control of man, is that the new regulations will apply for the first time to livestock kept on common land. The new regulations remove any duplication that previously existed between the Animal Welfare Act and the existing regulations. For example, the duty of care provision and the powers of entry are not included in the new regulations, as they are now provided for in  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC217"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Act. Likewise, the ability to issue improvement notices, which I referred to earlier, is now in the Act, and therefore a similar provision is no longer required in the new regulations. Thus, good practice that has been in farm animal welfare legislation for years now applies to all animals kept by man. I am sure that the Committee will agree that this is a significant step forward in the Government&#146;s and in Parliament&#146;s commitment to animal welfare.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000189"></a>The new regulations will continue the important role of raising standards of animal welfare on farms. The Government have taken a lead in implementing improvements at home and have been at the forefront of pushing for progress at EU and international level. We took the lead on encouraging Europe to follow the UK in implementing a ban on the use of veal crates, which have been banned in the UK since 1990. A ban on the use of veal crates across the EU came into force at the end of 2006. The UK banned close-confinement sow stalls in 1999. The EU pig directive adopted in 2001 contained several key provisions to improve the welfare of pigs, such as minimum space allowances for sows and gilts, access to environmental enrichment for all pigs and a ban on the use of sow stalls across the EU by 2013.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000190"></a>In 1999, a directive was adopted to protect the welfare of laying hens. The directive bans the barren battery cage from 2012 and introduces minimum standards for non-caged systems, such as barn and free range, as well as for enriched cage systems. In May this year, the UK was at the forefront of agreeing new rules to improve the welfare of meat chickens across Europe.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000191"></a>I make no apology that the UK has a higher standard of animal welfare today than at any time during its history. We have among the highest standards anywhere in the world. It is about time that the British public recognised that when buying their meat and stopped buying cheap imports where the animals have not been looked after as well as they are in this country. You cannot have it both ways. That message has to go out loud and clear. We cannot run &#147;Buy British&#148; campaigns. It is not legal. The fact of the matter is that the British public need to have it rammed down their throats&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;that our animals are better looked after on the farm than virtually anywhere else in the world, and that they owe it to the industry to make sure they support the industry.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000192"></a>By definition, the costs of production are in some cases increased. That puts our producers at a disadvantage in some ways to our competitors. As I say, we make no apology for having among the highest standards in the world; we just need to drag everybody up to our level. In the mean time, it would be helpful if the public gave more support in their buying habits.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000193"></a>The regulations are an important part of maintaining standards. With that in mind, I commend the regulations.</p>

I start by saying that I welcome the regulations, as they are intended to place in a single document the main strands of animal welfare legislation and EU directives in a single set of regulations for farm animals. I am sure that it will be in the main welcomed&#151;if &#147;welcome&#148; is the right word with which statutory instruments are greeted&#151;by the livestock farming community, the overwhelming majority of whom are maintaining the highest animal welfare practices, as the Minister said. That is evidenced by the relatively few incidents of mistreatment of animals occurring each year. We know that successful livestock businesses depend on proper care of stock.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000196"></a>We also welcome the practical way in which the order attempts to deal with animals on common land, something which has not previously been subject to specific animal welfare protection.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000197"></a>I thank the Minister for arranging a briefing meeting yesterday at short notice. It was most helpful in explaining the Government's approach to this piece of legislation, its provenance and interpretation. As many noble Lords will know, my noble friend Lady Byford is retiring from her responsibilities on the Opposition Front Bench after 10 years as Defra spokesman. I am sure the whole Committee would want to place on record the diligence and commitment with which she has undertaken her responsibilities and the skilful way in which she has handled her brief.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000198"></a>It was, therefore, particularly helpful for me to have the opportunity to meet the Minister in the company of my noble friend to consider some anxieties we had about the detail of this piece of legislation. If I repeat matters which the Minister was able to resolve for us, I do so only because it will give him the opportunity to place these matters on record. I know that my noble friend the Duke of Montrose has further points that he wishes to raise.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000199"></a>I turn to the regulations. In the main, the legislation is a translation of four EU directives plus a carry-over from the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1998, as has been said. En route it sweeps up the welfare of farmed animals regulations of 2000, 2002 and 2003. The overall effect can lead to confusing use of language. I quote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071062000264"></a>&#147;These Regulations apply to farmed animals only&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000249"></a>In fact, they apply to all farmed animals, Although I might say that there is no separate schedule for the proverbial sheep or goats or, for that matter, farmed exotics.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000200"></a>Similarly, the phrase in Schedule 1, Regulation (2)(2),</p>
<ul><a name="07071062000273"></a>&#147;animals ... must be inspected at intervals sufficient to avoid any suffering&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000250"></a>is, in practice, plainly impossible. The word &#147;unnecessary&#148; might help. We are assured that the Act will be interpreted in the light of what is reasonable, but I still have concerns. The first stems from the fact that enforcement duties will be in the hands of the local authorities unless the Secretary of State directs that he will prosecute either a particular case or cases related to a particular offence. Will the Minister tell us which local authority will have the duty of enforcement? If, for example, the  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC219"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC219</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>RSPCA gets a complaint, will it contact the legal department at county level, environmental health at borough or district level, or will it go, in the first instance, to the government animal health department? In the event of an infringement of the regulations, will the Minister confirm that a notice will be issued as a first remedy other than in the most serious cases of neglect? Will the Minister also tell us how much funding the Government will provide for the enforcement activity? I presume that fines will go directly to the Treasury.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000201"></a>My second concern is that in places the regulations read as though the rule is cut and dried where, in practice, it cannot be. Thus, a person must not attend to an animal,</p>
<ul><a name="07071062000274"></a>&#147;unless he is acquainted with any relevant code of practice and has access to the code while attending to the animal&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000251"></a>If the code is in a binder in the farm office and the animal is in the barn across the yard he may comply, but if the barn is in a second yard across a busy main road will he still have access? I recommend that the offending phrase be removed.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000202"></a>Similarly, in Schedule 1, Regulation 13:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071062000265"></a>&#147;Air circulation, dust levels ... relative ... humidity and gas concentrations must be kept within limits which are not harmful to the animals&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000252"></a>The government vet acknowledged that there are neither measurements nor standards for those and that common sense has to be applied. It would be best to remove the reference to &#147;limits&#148;.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000203"></a>I was pleased to be reassured that the back-up system referred to in Regulation 20 need not be a duplicate of an automated ventilation system, for example.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000204"></a>The penalties for contravening the regulations are to be increased. The prison tariff will be doubled. Is there any evidence that that is necessary or that it will be applied or that it results from even one incident where the currently permitted sanction was deemed insufficient? Will the Minister give us his assurance that Regulation 29 of Schedule 1 concerning genotypes and phenotypes will not be used to apply the conclusions of new science without full and proper debate?</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000205"></a>During the Minister&#146;s briefing meeting, we all agreed that the generality of the regulations should apply to the husbandry of all animals. I am, however, acutely aware that they will be enforced by individuals for whom the words used may mean more than simple common sense. We know that the cost of farming has already reached the stage where farmers are retiring and, in some cases, going out of business with no one to follow them, and we should not make the situation worse.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000206"></a>Schedule 1, Regulation 17, for example, contains the statement that animals not kept in buildings,</p>
<ul><a name="07071062000275"></a>&#147;must, at all times, have access to a well-drained lying area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000253"></a>In some parts of the country at the moment that will not be possible. When one adds it to the restrictions on animal movements before testing, after sale and so on, one feels that it may be totally unreasonable if strictly interpreted. I am sure that the courts would get the emphasis right, but I am reluctant to support wording which could lead to a farmer enduring hassle and  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC220"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expense unnecessarily. The replacement of &#147;at all times&#148; with &#147;normally&#148; would make the rule clearer and more enforceable. What is certain is that the phrase used earlier in Regulation 17, &#147;where necessary and possible&#148;, could be equally applicable to the &#147;well-drained lying area&#148; element.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000207"></a>I make no apology for drilling down to the detail of the regulations. We can approve them and move on. However, in implementing these regulations, we demand that others keep them central to their business and working lives. We owe it to our livestock farmers, stockmen, stockwomen and farm workers to make sure that what we ask them to do is reasonable as well as desirable.</p>

I look forward to debating many issues with him both in Committee and on the Floor of the House. I also welcome the fact that we will benefit from the experience of the brief which the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has and that he has not been reshuffled somewhere else. We certainly all appreciate the fact that he will continue to give us the benefit of his knowledge. Having said that, most of my questions will refer to issues raised in our debates on the Animal Welfare Bill.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70710-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000209"></a>I agree with the noble Lord&#146;s comments that much animal welfare is in the hands of consumers and their buying choices, but a lot also rests in the hands of the Government in how they choose to empower retailers through labelling schemes and, for example, whether they will make the Food Industry Sustainability Strategy voluntary or statutory. There was a fair amount of comment from the industry when it was made voluntary that it was fine for those who are happy to promote their goods on the basis of meeting very high standards and probably fine for those at the bottom of the pile who just sell on low price&#151;even if it is not so fine for animals&#151;but that it did nothing for all those in the middle. Although a lot of power is in the hands of consumers, the Government should not be sloping their shoulders in this regard.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000210"></a>I have a few questions for the Minister on the detail of the regulations. The first concerns Regulation 6, setting out the &#147;familiarity provision&#148; for codes of practice. It states that the person responsible must be familiar with how to look after an animal. The RIA suggests that this provision will cost the livestock industry &#163;7.9 million each year. Can the Minister explain how that figure was reached and what systems the Government have introduced to ensure that this familiarity, or those he understands the industry will introduce?</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000211"></a>My second question concerns livestock kept on common land, and I welcome the fact that the regulations will cover that. The NFU states that it would be useful to review in due course how this works in practice. Does the Minister have a timetable in mind for conducting such a review? Some common land is very low-lying and the recent flooding incidents highlighted the plight of trapped animals. I guess that that will be covered by the regulations through inspections and so on, but it

The regulations refer to exceptionally hot weather. Climate events will impinge more and more on welfare issues.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000212"></a>When we were debating the Animal Welfare Bill, I introduced an amendment on Report suggesting that in exercising the duty of care, a person responsible for an animal should have regard to its degree of domestication. The Minister rejected the suggestion as inappropriate, but Regulation 4 makes it clear that a person responsible for a farmed animal is obliged to have regard to its adaptation and domestication. Why does the Minister think it appropriate that domestication should be a consideration for farmed animals, which tend to include fewer exotic species, but not for companion animals? The Minister will remember that the debate was about companion animals as they were covered by the Bill; not particularly dogs and cats which everyone regards as domesticated, but rather those other species that are not.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000213"></a>My fourth point includes the question about standards for cages. Again, during debates on the Act, I raised the issue that there were no comparable standards for cages for game birds. I welcome the standards here, but the Minister told us on 23 October:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071062000266"></a>&#147;We intend to set up a working group before the end of the year, with the objective of producing the code in 2008&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/10/06; col. 1007.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000254"></a>I wonder whether he has a progress report for the Committee on that code.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000214"></a>My fifth point is that one of the economic savings listed in the RIA is that now farmers will not have to comply with improvement notices. Can the Minister confirm that inspectors will be able to issue improvement notices under Section 10 of the Animal Welfare Act and that if a person responsible for a farmed animal does not comply with the notice within the stated period the inspector may begin proceedings for an offence under Section 9(1)?</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000215"></a>My last point is about bees; not de minimis small-scale beekeeping but bee farming. Bee health is becoming more and more pressing. The regular inspections envisaged for other farm animals under the regulations might well have very much benefited the bee population. Very regular inspection is one of the ways of making sure that a virus does not spread and that the things likely to be causing colony collapse are kept under strict control. Will the Minister comment on that? That said, I welcome the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000216"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0006.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071062000328"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> Many in the Committee will know that I rear sheep and cattle, and I have the occasional horse and some chickens, but they are all situated in Scotland and are not exactly subject to the regulations. I have an interest in how this is seen. I am very grateful to the Minister for the way in which he laid out the relevance of the Animal Welfare Act to the whole question of animals and then how the regulations will fit in underneath that. There are certain slightly grey areas about the animals to which the regulations will apply. I am sure that the Minister can confirm that they will apply to hobby farms&#151;which are becoming more prevalent across the country&#151;and possibly to the house cow, which is becoming less prevalent but still raises some issues, which I will come to later. They probably do not apply to the Vietnamese

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000217"></a>The Minister is generally very good at clarifying that enforcement will show some reasonableness, but unfortunately we are not in our convention able to require the Government to amend any of the regulations. There are three areas on which I express some unease and possibly a feeling that things could have been worded a little differently. First, Schedule 1(5) to the regulations says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071062000267"></a>&#147;Any animals ... ill or injured must be cared for ... without delay&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000255"></a>Obviously, if you are going around your animals and you see one that is being strangled or is about to expire for some reason, you do act without delay. If, on the other hand, you are going around feeding your animals and you see one that is lame, you are probably better to finish feeding all the other animals, who will be charging around waiting for their food.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000256"></a>There are reasons for not doing it instantaneously. In some ways, it would have been handy if it could have said that it was &#147;without unnecessary delay&#148;.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000218"></a>Similarly, on Regulation 6, which states,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071062000268"></a>&#147;Where necessary, sick or injured animals must be isolated&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000257"></a>there is a problem with recumbent animals. Perhaps the vet should have power to give a derogation if the recumbent animal is in a place that makes it very difficult or impossible to isolate it. The standard really bad situation is when a cow goes down in a cubicle. Obviously, you could shut off the whole cubicle shed, but it might be difficult for access to animals. There may be ways in which you might be prevented from isolating the animal, although you could protect it in some way.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000219"></a>Regulation 9 states that animals,</p>
<ul><a name="07071062000276"></a>&#147;must not be restricted in such a way as to cause them unnecessary suffering or injury&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000258"></a>and Regulation 29 states that they,</p>
<ul><a name="07071062000277"></a>&#147;can be kept without any detrimental effect on their health and welfare&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000259"></a>The Minister may have covered this in what he said about the regulation on mutilations, but it strikes me that someone being particularly pedantic might object to the fact that you were clipping the wings of turkeys or other poultry which are kept in open areas. Again, that comes back to game birds, which were raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. In the younger stages, they have to have their wings clipped. Whether it injures or harms the animals is no doubt a question that lawyers would like to get into.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000220"></a>Regulation 1 of Schedule 6 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07071062000269"></a>&#147;No calf may be confined in an individual stall ... after the age of eight weeks&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000260"></a>Within the definition, that means a calf between the age of eight weeks and six months. This is where I come back to the house cow. There might be hill farmers or other small farmers again who have just one cow with one calf. If the farmer were strictly to obey the meaning of the wording of the regulation, when the calf reaches eight weeks&#146; old, he would either have to go out and buy another one or sell the one that he had; otherwise, it would be kept in isolation.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC223"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000221"></a>On health issues, treatments are offered by farmers which are not directly instructed or certified by vets. It is just possible that a farmer might want to isolate the animal without having to call in a vet in order to do so.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000222"></a>My final point probably can be covered by a bit of clarification. Regulation 1 of Schedule 7 states that all cattle must have,</p>
<ul><a name="07071062000278"></a>&#147;a well-drained and bedded lying area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071062000261"></a>That needs careful interpretation for dairy cows. Straw-bedded cubicles have been found to increase the level of mastitis and they are probably better off without bedding. The cubicle certainly would be a dry area, but it might not necessarily need bedding. Under the strict interpretation of this order, it looks like something would have to be provided. I would be grateful to hear what the Minister can tell us on those points.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000223"></a><b><a name="70710-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071062000329"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I am most grateful for the welcome for the regulations. I should like to add to what the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said about the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, who brought an elegance and charm to the Committees and to deliberations in the Chamber, as well as her expertise. I shall miss her greatly. I know that she has undertaken her role for a long time. When I joined MAFF in 1997, my noble friend Lord Donoughue was the farming Minister. He explained to me about the House of Lords&#151;to which I paid not the slightest interest&#151;the pressure he was under and the walloping he was getting from this noble Baroness, Lady Byford, on various issues. I fully understand why she has stepped down, because she kindly let me know some time ago.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000224"></a>I will try to answer most of the detailed points; in fact I will try to answer them all. The answer to most of the issues raised by the noble Duke is that these are the existing regulations. If there is an exception to that, I will delineate it. In other words, there is no invention of the wheel. Therefore, I can say with some comfort that the regulations are operating in a proportionate and common sense way. In looking at the words one sees that he has raised legitimate issues. They could be words transposed from regulations. If there is an exception to that I shall naturally come back to it.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000225"></a>I shall work through the points in no particular order; it is just how I pick them up. Bees are not covered.</p>

On the other hand, there is a good argument for keeping things as they are if there is not a problem. People understand these words when working with these regulations in other areas. I fully accept that if we can simplify and clarify things we should. In this case the one big change is about common land, which I will come to. Of course we are bound by EU directives and some of the wording is from the directives.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000228"></a>The noble Baroness raised the subject of bees. She accepted that they are not vertebrates and they are not covered. It does not mean that there is not a problem. If memory serves me right, one day before the Recess I am down to answer a Question. I am not sure whether it is the noble Baroness&#146;s Question. I know that there is a bee-health Question. She is right&#151;and I do not know much about bees&#151;the issue of opening up after the winter and finding that they are not there makes you ask whether perhaps you should have checked a bit earlier. There are some legitimate issues to be raised. I hope that I will be suitably briefed on the day of the Question.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000229"></a>The rearing of game birds was raised. We have commissioned a study into the welfare implications of using bits and spectacles in preparation for the introduction of the code. That is currently under way and is expected to be completed by November this year. The results of the research would then be subject to peer review and will inform the members of the working group tasked with writing the code. We expect to get that ready by the summer of 2008. I fully understand that there are concerns about the use of cages. It has been raised with me a few times, even before the recent reshuffle.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000230"></a>We have asked the Farm Animal Welfare Council to assess the system of management and report back on its findings. We think that that report will be ready by 2008. That will inform the working group. We hope to get any problems identified dealt with in the code of practice, which I hope will be satisfactory.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000231"></a>I was asked where the figure of &#163;7.9 million came from for farmers having to access and be familiar with welfare codes. The estimate was produced by an external consultancy during a cross-government exercise last year to identify the baseline for administrative burdens throughout Whitehall. The consultancy gathered average data from a number of farmers on the time taken, cost per hour and the numbers of people affected by the requirement. It calculated that it cost stock-keepers a total of &#163;6.7 million a year to ensure that they have access to and are familiar with the codes, and &#163;1.2 million a year for owners and managers to ensure that stock-keepers have had the instruction and guidance of the codes.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000232"></a>While the provision is being maintained, the additional burdens in the codes will be examined as part of our simplification plan. That is the plan for reducing administrative burdens, which I raved about at Question Time the other day and which we published in December last year. So we are seeking to reduce the administrative burdens. Part of the reason for getting these figures across government and Whitehall is so that we could actually make a measure and then do something about reducing them.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000233"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked me about the enforcement. Although I came to Defra when the Bill had almost finished its parliamentary process, so I only picked up the end bit from the Lords&#146; point of view, I understand that the issues raised by enforcement were quite well debated. But the enforcement by local authorities will be, as directed by the Secretary of State set out in Regulation 8 of the regulations.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC225"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column GC225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07071062000262"></a>If the first complaint goes to the RSPCA, I am not sure whether it has a duty on this or whether it can make an investigation. So far as the Animal Welfare Act is concerned, if not these regulations, the RSPCA is both an investigating and a prosecuting authority. But enforcement by local authorities will be as directed by the Secretary of State in Regulation 8.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000234"></a>In answer to the question relating to Schedule 1(29) in respect of the phenotype or genotype, the inspection bodies will record and report any evidence of detrimental effects. There will be a full debate on this, but the inspection bodies will make a report of evidence where there are detrimental effects. This answer may not be satisfactory because I do not fully understand it myself, but it is the best I have got and no doubt if more is needed, I can come back on it.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000235"></a>On suffering and the issue of well drained low-lying areas raised yesterday at the briefing, the offence in the regulations is to not take all reasonable steps to ensure that the conditions in which animals are kept comply with Schedule 1. Reasonable steps must be taken and common sense will have to prevail. We are not being overly prescriptive on these practical issues. It is true that the regulations are open to interpretation, but specific limits and times have not been laid down because normal, common-sense farming practice will ensure those. If the courts have to make an interpretation, they will look to custom and practice and will consider what was reasonable under the prevailing circumstances at the time of the alleged offence. That is an important aspect of the issue. As long as the farmer or keeper of the animals can show they took all reasonable steps, quite frankly, no offence will have been committed. A case will be considered in the totality of the circumstances.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000236"></a>I want to make it absolutely clear that enforcement has got to be both reasonable and proportionate. I have not yet had an opportunity to have a chat with Ben Bradshaw, who was doing this as his day job, as it were, before the reshuffle. But I did not get the impression from the papers I saw that a massive number of cases have arisen from the operation of the existing regulations. While there do not seem to have been any disproportionate effects, it is nevertheless something I want to look at.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000237"></a>The noble Baroness supported what I said about consumers, but took the opportunity to take a sideswipe at the Government for not doing enough on labelling and the issue of sustainability. She is quite right in a way. We are limited in what we can do on labelling, as I will make clear when responding to the Question we will have before the recess. Food labelling is a hot issue both in the department and across the food industry. I fully accept that and I think that people should be given as much information as possible, but without having a booklet to go with each product. If that happens, people will not read them. I think she agreed with the point I made, as indeed did the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="07071062000238"></a>On the issue of common land, I am happy to repeat the commitment I made yesterday in private. Clearly this is new, and I fully accept that things are going to change slightly because of the Commons Act 2006, and I fully accept that this year some of the single farm payments were delayed because of issues relating to common land. We were working from handwritten registers dating back to 1965, which I saw myself, all handled by the Exeter office of the Rural Payments Agency. I know the difficulties it was dealing with. We solved most of the problems and got the payments out, so it is not a long-term problem, but I understand that farmers with commons rights might feel as though we are coming down on them; we are not. I am happy to give a commitment on behalf of the Government&#151;not for myself because I suspect that Ministers come and go&#151;that we will review the operation of these regulations on common land after a couple of seasons. I think that that is reasonable in the circumstances.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000239"></a>I have answered on bees. I wonder whether I have missed something. Yes, bedding for dairy cows. Apparently, it can be interpreted widely that straw, shavings, sand, rubber mats and mattresses are all used as bedding. When I was at the Great North Meet early this year or late last year, I saw examples of rubber bedding that I had not seen before. It was far superior to other forms of bedding that the manufacturers and suppliers were making, and it was made from what was previously called waste, if I remember rightly. That is a big advantage. It was a win-win situation. The interpretation of &#147;bedding&#148; goes much beyond the traditional sense of either straw or sand, to rubber mats. I hope that that definition would not be a problem in the circumstances that the noble Duke raised. It depends what the circumstances are for those dairy cows.</p>

<a name="70710-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07071062000240"></a>If I have missed anything out, I will be happy to come back on it, but as far as I can see from my notes, there is nothing else.</p>

Some of my questions were principally about wording and the way in which wording might be interpreted by a particularly officious person if they chose to do so. The Committee has been reassured by the commitment that the Minister has given and by his determination to seek to take the industry with him in seeing the regulations work for the benefit and the reputation of the industry with the consumer and the marketplace.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="07071042000011"></a><b><a name="70710-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07071042000024"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Tom Harris) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70710-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07071042000012"></a>The department is today announcing that Arriva Trains Cross Country Ltd has been awarded the new cross-country franchise. The new franchise combines most of the existing cross-country services currently operated by Virgin Cross Country and some services currently operated by Central Trains.</p>

<a name="70710-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07071042000013"></a>The contract will begin on 11<sup></sup>November 2007 and run for eight years and four months with the option for the Department for Transport (DfT) to terminate the contract after six years if performance targets are not met. The DfT will pay Arriva Trains Cross Country Ltd a subsidy of &#163;1,056 billion.</p>

<a name="70710-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07071042000014"></a>The contract which DfT has signed will add capacity by nearly 3,000 seats each day on key routes at the busiest times by June 2009. Most additional  


<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS96"></a><b>10 July 2007 : Column WS96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>seating capacity will be provided by reintroducing high-speed trains to the network. These trains will be refurbished to the standard of the Voyager trains used on current cross country services; further seating capacity and additional luggage space will be added by modifying the Voyager fleet. The Stansted-Birmingham and Nottingham-Cardiff routes will see refurbished trains by June 2009 featuring more seats, and new first class accommodation.</p>

<a name="70710-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07071042000015"></a>A new timetable will be introduced in December 2008 based on the route structure specified developed by a cross-industry group to maximise the benefits of the west coast main line modernisation. Arriva Trains Cross Country Ltd will offer a limited number of service extensions above and beyond the minimum specification maintaining some current direct journey opportunities which were not included in the franchise specification.</p>

<a name="70710-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07071042000016"></a>Extra help will be provided for passengers who need to change trains, especially at Birmingham New Street. On-board staff will be equipped with technology to give up to the minute information on train times and connections. There will be an information campaign to advise passengers of other stations where they can change more easily than at Birmingham New Street. Extra staff will be employed to help passengers during major timetable changes in December 2008.</p>

<a name="70710-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07071042000017"></a>Arriva Trains Cross Country Ltd is contracted to improve performance and will introduce state of the art web-based ticketing which will allow customers to print tickets at home.</p>

<a name="70710-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07071042000018"></a>The Government will continue to regulate fares for the franchise in line with national policy, currently RPI+1 per cent. As with all franchises, unregulated fares are the responsibility of individual operators.</p>

<a name="70710-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07071042000019"></a>In the new cross-country franchise, Arriva Trains Cross Country Ltd has indicated possible average rises in unregulated fares of 3.4 per cent above inflation each year.</p>

<a name="70710-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07071042000020"></a>The new cross-country franchise will offer a single compensation policy for all passengers. As with other recently announced franchises, discounts in renewal for season tickets valid between one month and one year in compensation for poor punctuality and reliability will be replaced by compensation based on delays to individual journeys, known as delay/repay. Under the new system, all passengers will be entitled to claim compensation for all delays, whatever their cause:</p>
 fifty per cent of the price paid for a single-leg journey delayed by between 30 and 59 minutes; 100 per cent of the price paid for a single-leg journey delayed by between 60 and 119 minutes; and 100 per cent of the price paid for a return journey delayed by more than 119 minutes. 
<a name="70710-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07071042000021"></a>The changes will also start to standardise disparate compensation arrangements for single, return and weekly season ticket holders on different train operators.</p>

<a name="70710w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="07071033000020"></a>This is because proceedings for breach of an ASBO are often heard at the same time as proceedings for other offences. This may lead to defendants receiving a custodial sentence for breaching an ASBO concurrently with a custodial sentence for another offence. The Office for Criminal Justice Reform has separate disposal codes to differentiate between concurrent and consecutive sentences, but the distinction between them is unreliable.</p>

VisitBritain, the regional development agencies and other stakeholders are represented on the forum to help to ensure that the tourism industry maximises the opportunities that the cultural Olympiad offers.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_166"></a><a name="07071033000049"></a>In addition, we are setting up a network of regional creative programmers in the eight English regions outside London, whose role will be to facilitate and co-ordinate each region's participation in the cultural Olympiad in the run-up to the 2012 Games. They will work with the nations and regions co-ordinators for London 2012, seeking compatibility between regional cultural plans and the wider regional strategies for 2012, so that cultural events complement local tourism initiatives and events strategies.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_167"></a><a name="07071033000050"></a>DCMS and its tourism partners will shortly publish a strategy aimed at enabling the tourism sector to make the most of the 2012 opportunity. One of the principles of this will be that the benefits of the Games are felt as widely as possible throughout the UK.</p>

It is for the relevant highway authority to determine whether lay-bys (which are part of the public highway) should have waiting and loading restrictions. Such restrictions require a traffic regulation order and may apply different times and different types of vehicle but not the type of unloading.</p>
