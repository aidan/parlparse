<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Desai </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their response, in terms of bilateral and multilateral humanitarian and overseas aid policies, to the recent multi-donor evaluation of the handling of the conflict in Rwanda and its aftermath.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  My Lords, we supported preparation of the study and we expect to discuss the recommendations from the evaluation report with other donors, UN agencies and non-governmental organisations.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Can she tell the House what Her Majesty's Government are doing about the problem?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, we supported the study on the Rwanda evaluation to see what lessons we could learn from it. One of the good things to come out of the study is that the input by British non-governmental organisations has obviously been extremely well respected there. We also closely monitored the humanitarian effort throughout the emergency phase and shall continue to do so. We are sharing with others the lessons that we learnt in order to try to achieve better co-ordination of the efforts when such ghastly tragedies occur.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that one of the lessons of that dreadful story is that humanitarian operations can never be a substitute for <P>


<a name="column_2"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>timely political action and proactive diplomacy? Does she further agree that timely political action was needed most in April 1994 and is it not timely political action that is needed most now in the Great Lakes region as a whole? What lessons have the Minister and the Government drawn from the role of the Security Council in 1994 in failing to respond and to recognise genocide? What are they promoting as positive diplomacy now to deal with the overall situation in the region?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I, for one, am glad that this is the only time that we have seen something quite so horrendous as the genocide in Rwanda. One of the difficulties back in April 1994 was that no one could envisage what was building up, even those who knew the country. From it, we have learnt the need for pre-conflict action, as the noble Lord said. That is why this country has been engaged on a major programme of conflict prevention, working particularly in Africa. So far there have been four seminars in different parts of Africa with military and civilian personnel, to try to find out the key issues that turn a country away from normal civilized behaviour and towards such total uncivilized behaviour.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-01_para0"></a>With regard to Burundi, where there is most concern at the moment, we have been visiting regularly. There is the Great Lakes Conference, and we had the Tunis Conference a couple of weeks ago, when many of the key players were brought together. I believe that the whole world has learnt a lesson from the genocide in Rwanda and everyone is determined that it shall never happen again. That is why we are now much more proactive across the world--not just the few of us who were involved right at the beginning in Rwanda--in trying to prevent it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, if the situation in Burundi becomes worse, what action, taken from the lessons of Rwanda, will the Minister consider undertaking?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, first, the situation in Burundi was linked with Rwanda, but is by no means identical. Certainly, it is an over-simplification to <P>


<a name="column_3"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggest that the lessons we learnt from Rwanda have a direct application in Burundi. We are playing our full part already in the international preventive diplomacy. We are bolstering the standing of moderates within the power-sharing government. By individual visits to Burundi (which I shall visit again in August) we are putting a whole series of pressures on those people. Past President Nyerere of Tanzania is spearheading the peace-making process. We are offering him every support and we have constant contact. In addition, there is the European Union Special Representative, Aldo Ajello, whom I saw last Thursday. He is on his way to work on all the problems of the Great Lakes but doing so from a base in Addis Ababa, so that he connects up with the Organisation of African Unity. So I can assure the noble Lord that we are all involved in trying to prevent further tragedy.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Baroness give us a progress report on the reintegration of the large number of refugees from Rwanda back into the economy of that country, in such a way that they do not need to have continuous outside aid from now onwards?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the return of refugees is slow, as the noble Lord, Lord Rea, said. But the trilateral talks with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and neighbouring governments succeeded in agreeing a means of safe and voluntary return, and the Tunis and Addis Ababa meetings are taking that forward. Those who have returned need to be enabled to take up their old occupations and start to live a steady life. Britain has put resources into helping that to happen and to get people back to normality.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that one of the chief problems is that the countries concerned have infrastructures which, such as they were, collapsed? It is extremely difficult to help a country to get on its feet if it has no infrastructure of its own with which to do it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is right. That was why, in Rwanda, one of the first things we did was to try to get the health service, such as it is, and the basic education service going again. Without those there was nothing to stabilise the community. We have also given help for the building up of civilian administration in Rwanda. The Government of Rwanda have come a long way, though there is much to be done to have anything like an infrastructure as we would know it and as Rwanda once had, which is the sadness of the situation. All that has been destroyed and it will take us a fair time to put it back on its feet. I believe that relations between us and Rwanda are very good. They are prepared to accept civilian help even though, understandably, they do not want military help.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew10"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, are the Government considering financial assistance to past President Nyerere's initiative as a regional honest broker?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, that may be necessary. We have given a lot of help to Rwanda <P>


<a name="column_4"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 4</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and continue to help through the NGOs. The Carter Centre initiative, which has encouraged the dialogue, does not need our funding. If there should be any special need for funding for past President Nyerere, I shall look at it. He certainly has not asked for any at the present time.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "60401-01_para1"></a>What action they are taking in the light of the rejection by this House of their plans for the privatisation of the system for recruitment to the Civil Service.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="60401-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Earl Howe): </B>  My Lords, the Government are still considering their response to the opinions expressed by the House on this matter. We have also noted the recommendation that a Select Committee on the public service be established which might consider as its first report the Government's plan for the future of Recruitment and Assessment Services.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Can he say when we are likely to hear what the Government's decision is, given the clear view of this House as expressed and related in the Question?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew14"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, at the conclusion of our debate on 8th March, my noble friend the Leader of the House gave an assurance that the Government would come back to the House once our conclusions on the way forward are finalised. As my noble friend will understand, they are important and complex issues to which we shall need to give full and careful consideration. That process is still continuing. Clearly, we hope to report to the House as soon as we can.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, the Minister will recall the debate on 8th March; he took part in it and I listened to it. Can he go this far and say that, until the Select Committee has reported on this aspect of the public service--I understand that the committee is to be set up shortly and this is to be the first matter that it will consider--the Government will take no further action towards the privatisation of the service?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I note carefully the suggestion of the noble Lord. It is one that we shall consider in preparing our response to your Lordships.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, does not the Minister agree that there are two distinct issues in this Question: one is the merits of privatising the selection of the Civil Service, with which some of us may well have sympathy; the other, which some of us see as far more <P>


<a name="column_5"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important, is that no temporary government should have the right unilaterally to interfere with the selection of the Civil Service?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord will recall from the debate that selection for the Civil Service will remain with the Civil Service Commissioners. That was one of the central points that I stressed in the debate. The Government's proposals for RAS do not have any bearing on the noble Lord's anxieties.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that it would be slightly surprising were we to appoint a Select Committee of this House to consider this issue without receiving an undertaking from the noble Earl that the Government will not announce their final decision on the matter until the committee has made its recommendation to the House?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, as I said to the noble Lord, Lord Richard, I note the anxiety expressed on that score. Clearly it is one that we shall need to bear in mind.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, whatever changes may be considered within the structure of the Civil Service, can the Minister say that, before they are finalised, all staff associations involved will be consulted?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the staff of RAS and the staff associations are being kept fully informed of progress as we go along.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Allen of Abbeydale: </B>   My Lords, when is the report of the Liaison Committee likely to be considered by this House?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, unfortunately I am not in a position to say. We hope that the Select Committee will be established very soon. I understand that, if it is, its terms of reference are likely to be approved tomorrow. Its membership should then follow on from that in a week or two. It will be for members of the committee to decide what their programme of work should be.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that it is understood that he may be inhibited from giving any formal undertaking, but that, pending the report of the Select Committee, it would be desirable that there should be a moratorium? It would be inconsistent with the setting up of such a committee that any further positive action should be taken.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. I can only repeat to him that this is clearly a concern which we shall need to take fully into account.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bancroft: </B>   My Lords, simply for the avoidance of doubt and as a superfluous postscript to the many questions that have been asked on this subject, perhaps I may ask the noble Earl whether, in addition to postponing action until after the Select Committee has <P>


<a name="column_6"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 6</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made its interim report, any action will be postponed until after this House has had an opportunity to debate that report.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew12"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, a further debate on the future of RAS is a matter for the usual channels, but I note the noble Lord's suggestion.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Hayhoe: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that those of us who know the Civil Service well--I had some responsibility for it both as a Minister in the Civil Service Department and in the Treasury--and who were very concerned when they first learnt of this privatisation proposal would welcome the careful consideration which a Select Committee would give to it? Certainly, speaking for myself, I hope that at the end of the day this proposal will be dropped.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew14"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am only too well aware that on 8th March I was in a minority of--I shall say no more than a very small minority. So my noble friend's opinion does not altogether surprise me. However, I am sure that your Lordships will accept that the Government will give careful consideration to this matter in the light of the opinion expressed by your Lordships. We shall hope to report to the House as soon as we can.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, for the record, the Minister was in a minority of one on that occasion.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew16"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Two.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I beg the noble Earl's pardon. At whatever time the Government come back to fulfil the undertaking given by the Leader of the House on 8th March, will the Minister give an assurance that it will not be in the non-debatable form of a Written Answer or an answer to an Unstarred Question but in a form which enables the House not only to debate the matter but to express a view on it?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew18"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, no decisions have been taken. I note the noble Lord's wish. Whether we have a further debate is, of course, something for the usual channels to decide.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Molloy asked about consultation with the staff representatives but the Minister referred to information being given to them. Can he give an undertaking that there will be genuine consultation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew20"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the Civil Service, as a customer of RAS, has been consulted all along because clearly it is the one which needs to ensure that the contract with a privatised body, should this occur, is satisfactory. However, following the Government's decision, I can reassure the noble Baroness that staff have been kept informed of progress through regular staff meetings, information bulletins and things of that kind. The acting chief executive and senior managers <P>

<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "60401-02_para0"></a>What action they will take at the next meeting of the Council of Culture Ministers to counteract the European Commission's proposals to harmonise the droit de suite (artists' resale rights) levy which will greatly affect public sales of works of art in Britain and Europe as a whole.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="60401-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Fraser of Carmyllie): </B>  My Lords, we shall need to consider the Commission's proposal on droit de suite--that is, artists' right to share in the proceeds of the resale of their works--and intend consulting all interested parties in the United Kingdom about it. However, the Government are not persuaded that there is a case for the introduction of droit de suite into the United Kingdom.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend for that satisfactory Answer. However, as the Minister knows, the new rules on the introduction of VAT on works of art which came into force last year are already having a damaging effect on the UK trade. This is because there is no import tax into Switzerland or the United States. Are the Government aware of the serious economic consequences of this provision?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   Very much so, my Lords. We are conscious that one of the consequences of introducing this provision into the United Kingdom could be the displacement of art sales from the United Kingdom to other countries where there is no such suite. I imagine that New York is likely to be the most prominent beneficiary were such a change to be introduced. The potential impact on the London art market is clearly of utmost concern and it is for that very reason that we wish to consult all interested parties in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew24"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that this droit de suite levy, rising from only 2 per cent., will do little to help young artists but could amount to as much as &#163;30,000 on a major work of art and in consequence, as the noble and learned Lord said, sales of important 20th century art are likely to move from London, which is at present the centre of this art market, to New York?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew25"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   Yes, my Lords. My understanding is that the Commission has not yet put forward its final set of proposals before the matter goes to the Council and others for consideration. However, the idea is that there should be a sliding scale with the levy going from 2 per cent. to as much as 4 per <P>


<a name="column_8"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cent. In some circumstances, for the cheaper works of artists, clearly that would not be a very significant addition to the income of an artist or his heirs, but it could be an extremely expensive item and it could have a serious deterrent effect on those who wish to use the London market. It would be a very serious consideration if London were to lose its pre-eminence.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-02_spnew26"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, does my noble and learned friend agree that the result of his consultation exercise may well be a foregone conclusion in this country but that it will not do him much good when he comes to negotiate the matter in Brussels? Does he agree that with this piece of legislation, as with the common fisheries policy, the common agricultural policy, the fruit and vegetable regime and many other pieces of damaging legislation from Brussels, the Government will be up against a qualified majority vote within the terms of the treaty which was unfortunately signed and that there will not be anything they can do about it?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, it is my understanding that the Commission intends to bring this proposal forward under Article 100a which would mean that qualified majority voting would be the order of the day. It is nevertheless right that we should go forward with the consultation I have indicated. I am already very much aware of the strong representations that has come from the major auction houses in London setting forward their opposition to it. I understand that there are others who would purport to act, or may indeed act, for artists and their representatives who might take up a different point of view. I think it only right that we should carry forward that consultation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware that the opposition to droit de suite comes exclusively from the fat cats? So far as concerns the artists, this is right and is supported by all right thinking people as being a means whereby the artist is able to have a small share in the increasing value of his work. Therefore, it is my hope that the noble and learned Lord will not be influenced by the opposition that has been expressed, from wherever it has come, and will consider the matter on its merits. If he does that, he will accept it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, as I have indicated in my previous answers, I am well aware of the strong representations from major auction houses in London. I do not think that their views are to be set aside. London enjoys a worthwhile pre-eminence and I very much hope that that can be maintained. The noble Lord makes my point for me. I indicated that it was right that on the proposal coming from the Commission there should be proper consultation. It is a rather extraordinary position that in some countries in Europe where this droit is already allowed it is nonetheless not implemented. That seems to be the least satisfactory of all positions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Gowrie: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a director of an auction house. Will my noble and learned friend reiterate to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins <P>


<a name="column_9"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 9</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of Putney, and others that this is not an issue that is going to affect the auction houses themselves, simply the locations in which they conduct their business? Is my noble friend aware that it is not universally accepted by artists that this programme is in their interests? In the very unfortunate event of there being a qualified majority vote on this issue, can we for once copy our European partners and ignore it?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie:  </B>   My Lords, my noble friend will not be surprised if I do not answer directly his last point. The substance of what he has to say is right. It is not that artists or their heirs may receive something that they would not otherwise have received. The greater likelihood is rather that the sale of those works will not be undertaken in London or within the European Union, but the sales will be displaced either to the United States, other than to California, where no such right exists or, alternatively, they may take place in Switzerland.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there are other differences apart from the 3 per cent. droit de suite levy in the art market between France and the United Kingdom? For instance, is the Minister aware that in the United Kingdom there is 2.5 per cent. VAT, but in France it is 5 per cent.? Is he further aware that in France dealer commissions are limited to 9 per cent. by law, and in the United Kingdom dealers can charge up to 15 per cent.? Will the Minister take these matters into account when conducting his consultations? Does he agree that harmonisation would bring real competition to the art market in the European Union?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie:  </B>   My Lords, I am not clear that I understand from the noble Lord's question whether he is in favour of the introduction of this measure into the United Kingdom. I am sure that in a supplementary question he will make it clear from the Opposition Front Bench where exactly he stands on this issue. I would have thought that there was little within the operations of the commercial auctioneering firms in France that we wish to copy. The only good news that has come out of that is the announcement by the French Government that, after considerable pressure, its market will be opened up on 1st January 1998. That is a welcome development; but we should like that date brought forward.

<FONT SIZE=3>Declaration, Hong Kong will return to China in 1997, and China has guaranteed the continuation of Hong Kong's way of life for 50 years.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Does my noble friend agree with me that China's recent bullying of Taiwan and its determination to scrap the recently elected LegCo, to replace it with an appointed body and to extract a pledge of loyalty to that body from Hong Kong's senior civil servants raise serious doubts about its commitment to freedom and democracy? I ask my noble friend specifically what steps, if any, the Government intend to take to protect the existing LegCo and the electoral arrangements which created it, beyond the date of the handover of Hong Kong to China next year.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, we are all well aware that the Chinese exercises against Taiwan were intended to influence the Taiwanese electorate in the run-up to the presidential election on 23rd March and to try to condition the approach of the victor to the China-Taiwan contacts. I believe that the scale of the exercises discredited once and for all China's earlier emphasis on peaceful reunification. Certainly, the bullying did not work. I understand my noble friend's serious doubts, but it is perfectly clear, as my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said to the Chinese Prime Minister at their meeting in Bangkok on 29th February, that our view is that the members of LegCo, elected last year, should be allowed to serve their full four-year term. We have told the Chinese that there is no justification for the establishment of a provisional legislature. We shall continue to urge them to reconsider this. Meanwhile, we stand by our commitment to work with the legitimate legislature, which is LegCo. We shall certainly continue to keep the interest in this matter, which has been expressed by many friendly countries, and we shall watch very carefully what is happening.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may pursue the question of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, a little further with the Minister. Can she say what the British Government's response is to the latest move by the Chinese Government in demanding that Hong Kong civil servants support the Peking-appointed provisional legislative council after takeover? Have any representations been made to the Chinese Government since the Prime Ministers' meeting in Bangkok at the end of February?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   Yes, my Lords, we have made it quite clear that any move to create a conflict of loyalties would be damaging to the confidence of the Civil Service and for Hong Kong. We have made inquiries of the Chinese. We continue to find out exactly what they are seeking to say. As soon as we have a better understanding of what they are saying, apart from their threats, I shall be able to say a little more. We are well aware of the very serious implications of their remarks should they be carried through.

<A NAME="60401-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the recent missile tests and military exercises in the neighbourhood of the Taiwanese coast by the Chinese authorities constitute a breach of the United Nations Charter which prohibits the threat of the use of force? Can she say what mechanism exists within the United Nations' system for countering these threats of aggression where the aggressor itself is a permanent member of the Security Council?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the supplementary question of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, goes a little wide of the Question. All I can say to him is that these matters have not gone unnoticed. They are being discussed in New York, as I heard last week. No doubt the Security Council will, in its wisdom, come up with one of its famous answers.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Wilson of Tillyorn: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that despite some anxieties in Hong Kong which are understandable, and a good deal of friction with China, the development of Hong Kong remains remarkable? Does she further agree that there are many people in Hong Kong who are determined to make a success of the arrangements which come into force next year and the new relationship with China that that implies, and that this is an attitude which deserves support?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-03_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Wilson of Tillyorn. He knows better than anyone how determined the Hong Kong people are to make a success of the economy which they have built up. When one meets businessmen, and even those from China, they too want to share in a similar success in the Special Administrative Region. Therefore, these people are to be praised and encouraged. We must carry on doing that. It is quite remarkable how confident people are. I saw that for myself last year. We should do everything we can to encourage that confidence and do nothing to undermine it.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para3"></a>[The CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES in the Chair.]
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para4"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 111, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   We resume the debate which this Committee had on Thursday evening on the Question of Clause 111 standing part of the Bill. At that time there were not many noble Lords opposite who were prepared to support the Government in their legislation and, regrettably, noble Lords were not available, with the enthusiasm that one would normally expect, to support the noble Earl in his honest and capable endeavours in trying to get this legislation through the Committee. It was perfectly understandable because the fact is that Clause 111 should not stand part of the Bill. It is no wonder that noble Lords opposite felt that they could not possibly support it. Indeed, even now the noble Lord the Leader of the House is demonstrating his confidence in the noble Earl's case by standing at the Bar. That is perfectly understandable for the simple reason that the scheme that has been produced in draft by the Department of the Environment is not a scheme for adjudication; it is a scheme for arbitration. Indeed, the Chief Whip is now deserting the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para5"></a>I am certain that over the weekend the noble Earl received many representations stating that the industry, in the broadest sense of the word, simply does not agree with the thrust of the draft proposals. We debated that at some length on Thursday evening and I am sorry that noble Lords opposite were not available to hear the arguments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para6"></a>I shall make just one point now. As both I and my noble friend Lord Howie said on Thursday, at one point we were proposing to table the scheme as a schedule to the Bill. Under the procedures of the House, that would have allowed us not only to discuss it substantively, but to amend those provisions if any noble Lord had chosen to table a further amendment. We could therefore have had discussions on different parts of the scheme. As my noble friend Lord Howie pointed out, after consideration we decided not to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para7"></a>Nevertheless, I very much hope that when he comes to argue the case, the noble Earl will agree that the scheme as it stands is not acceptable either to this Committee or--this is much more important--to the industry at large. If the noble Earl can say to me today that he is producing new draft proposals for a scheme for adjudication rather than for arbitration, I should be perfectly happy, as I am sure would my noble friend, to cease our opposition to Clause 111. If, on the other hand, the scheme proceeds along the lines of the draft proposals, I am bound to advise the noble Earl that although we have decided not to table the provisions as a schedule in Committee, our view may well be different on Report.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I, too, have received a number of representations from the industry over the weekend about the scheme. As one who has worked in the industry for much of my life, it hurts me that although the Latham Report had the almost universal support of the industry, we now have a Bill which has been questioned by many of us and a scheme which I do not believe that anybody supports. I wonder whether the Minister received any representations over the weekend and which of the original supporters of the Latham Report are now with us even in general terms, apart from the process workers who do not want to be part of it anyway.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para8"></a>Perhaps I may quote from one or two comments that I have received. I refer first to the Institution of Civil Engineers and to its chief conciliation and arbitration advisory panel, which has stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is a sad reflection upon our means of communication that the outcome has been this dismal Bill". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is not a great compliment for the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para9"></a>The Building Employers Confederation has said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have given it the thumbs down and we will be looking for significant amendments". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That was referring to the scheme, not to the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para10"></a>The subcontractors group, the Constructors Liaison Group, describes it as "quite appalling". Lastly and perhaps most importantly, the solicitors who have to work on arbitration and adjudication for the industry and the Official Referees Solicitors Association say that they believe that the whole scheme is "misconceived" and that the Government appear to be muddling adjudication with arbitration. What has happened between the publication of the Latham Report and the introduction of the provisions of this scheme? Do those who have had to turn the report into the Bill understand what they are trying to do? Even in its early draft form, the scheme seems to muddle arbitration with adjudication.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para11"></a>I hope that the Minister will agree to consult urgently with the industry and that he will either come up with an alternative solution, as the noble Lord, Lord Williams, suggested, or delay the introduction of the scheme until we have a new version; otherwise the industry will continue to complain about the scheme which will remain unworkable. I believe that it will cause us much more trouble in the future, both here and in another place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-04_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   During the proceedings on Thursday, my concern about the scheme's shortcomings increased almost by the minute. Noble Lords who have already spoken have referred to the lack of clarity as to whether it is an adjudication scheme. We approached the question rather crabwise on Thursday. The more questions that we asked, the more concerns noble Lords both on these Benches and the Labour Benches had about the scheme and about the final resolution to be proposed; about the Bill's relationship with the Arbitration Bill; and, returning to broader questions, about just which construction contracts would be subject to the scheme.
<P>


<a name="column_14"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 14</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para12"></a>I have just read a report from a newspaper which is published for the construction industry, stating that the Constructors Liaison Group believes that the scheme,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"demonstrates a crucial misunderstanding in the mind of the DoE of the difference between adjudication and arbitration ... We regard adjudication as the key to solving a lot of the problems in the industry. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>If that is spoiled, we will be getting rid of the key part of this whole process". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The article concludes--I believe that this is very telling:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Indeed, if we go down the road proposed by the DoE, we could end up increasing litigation rather than reducing it". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That would go entirely against the objectives of the Latham Committee and, I believe, of the Government.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   Surprising as it may seem, I was greatly encouraged by the events of last Thursday evening. Because so few noble Lords stayed behind to oppose my Motion that Clause 111 should not stand part of the Bill, I took it that they agreed with me by abstention, if not by their actual presence. I must be right in that because if those noble Lords had thought that I was wrong, I am sure that they would certainly have stayed behind to support the Government and to oppose me.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para13"></a>I do not want to repeat the speech that I made on Thursday although many noble Lords who are present now missed it then, but I am sure that they will have studied it closely in the Official Report. Your Lordships will be glad to learn that I should like to make just two brief general points. First, the draft scheme is closer to arbitration than it is to adjudication. It is clear that parts of the draft scheme have been lifted more or less in their entirety from the Arbitration Bill, and that they have been slotted into the scheme as though arbitration were a species of adjudication which, as we all know, it is not.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para14"></a>My only other point, which I made on Thursday also, is that by its very nature the scheme will apply only to small contracts because most contracts in the construction industry are based on standard conditions of contract which have been laid down and agreed over many years. They are well understood on all sides of the industry. It is obvious that contracts of any substantial size will be laid under the umbrella of those standard conditions of contract. It is also true that at the moment those standard conditions do not wholly comply with the Bill, but there is no doubt that they will be amended or altered in such a way that they meet the conditions of Clause 105. That leaves out the lesser, smaller contracts which are not usually made under the standard conditions. The problem is that the scheme is more draconian than the standard conditions. The effect is that the scheme, which is more severe, will bear more heavily on small contracts than on big ones. That is unfair. The Government's strategy is that if the scheme is draconian, small contractors will be obliged to adopt the standard conditions; but, in my experience, life is not like that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para15"></a>A moment or two ago my noble friend Lord Berkeley wondered whether there was an alternative to the scheme. I believe there is. If the Government are acquainted, as they must be, with the sixth edition of the standard conditions of contract published by the <P>


<a name="column_15"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 15</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Institution of Civil Engineers, they will be aware that the conditions contain a procedure for conciliation. In this context, conciliation is almost the same as adjudication. The civil engineers' procedure for conciliation is much shorter and less complicated than the proposed scheme. Therefore, it is much more likely to be understood and used. It is also much less ambiguous than the scheme. The scheme is replete with ambiguities. I believe that many in the construction industry would prefer that the standard procedure in the sixth edition were used instead of the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-04_para16"></a>My noble friend Lord Williams has already said that thought was given to putting down the scheme as a new schedule at Committee stage so that it could be debated and perhaps understood by your Lordships. In the end that was not done. I will take advice on whether it is possible to put down the civil engineers' procedure for conciliation as a schedule to the Bill at Report stage. If that can be done procedurally, I shall certainly consider doing so. It will be a great improvement on the scheme. I suggest that a much better idea would be for the Government to have a look at it--if they have not already done so--and replace this ambiguous, tortuous and too lengthy scheme with something of the kind that I have suggested.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60401-05_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   I oppose the suggestion of the noble Lords, Lord Williams and Lord Howie of Troon, in part because of a whole series of logistics. If Clause 111 is deleted, it will remove any further opportunity that the House might have to make comments on the scheme at Report stage and on Third Reading. All of us have difficulties with some of the words of the scheme. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, indicated that the more it was looked at the more there was to consider. The scheme has only just come before us and there has been only a relatively short time in which to look at it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   Perhaps I may intervene with the leave of the noble Viscount. The scheme is referred to in Clause 105(3), so even if this clause is removed from the Bill, there will still be an opportunity to refer to the scheme for construction contracts when we come to discuss that clause on Report.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-05_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   I understand what the noble Lord says. However, Clause 111 gives it a statutory base. A scheme without a statutory base is not worth discussing in your Lordships' House. We need to make certain that it has that statutory base. I was about to tell the Committee that my noble friend the Minister has already indicated that the scheme is out for consultation. The Government and the industry will have plenty of opportunity to look at it. The Government will hear what noble Lords say in the discussions to date and will have an opportunity to hear what noble Lords say on the next two stages of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para0"></a>The right course of action is not to remove the scheme from the Bill at this moment but to make known our views on whether what is in the scheme is right, whether it is too close to arbitration and not close enough to adjudication, and so forth. All those considerations will <P>


<a name="column_16"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be taken into account by my noble friend. I believe that the course of action proposed by the noble Lords, Lord Williams of Elvel and Lord Howie of Troon, is wrong.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   Can the noble Viscount tell the Committee at which stage the Government should remove the scheme, if it should not be removed now?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-05_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   As my noble friend has already indicated, it is a draft scheme. The word "draft" is written all over it. It will have to be put before Parliament before it becomes "the" scheme.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-05_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I have a certain amount of sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. I commiserate with him. I do not wish to take advantage of him. Whenever he gets up to speak the Chamber seems to evacuate itself (as the scientists would say). That happens because the noble Lord always seems to get up just after Question Time. I do not think he should worry that it is anything to do with him. The Chamber probably feels that there are other things to deal with which are of more pressing importance than the noble Lord's speech. The noble Lord should not become too depressed by it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para1"></a>He began his speech this afternoon by saying that we did not have enough people here last Thursday night to support the Government. That is perfectly true. If I may say so without impertinence, I do not believe that the noble Lord had too many people to listen to his erudite speeches. There were only eight on his side. Of course, it is the job of the Government to keep a House. When this side was in opposition and I was a young fellow with dark hair, it was thought to be rather good fun to ambush people. However, when in government one regards it as rather childish. One takes a different point of view depending on where one is. The noble Lord had his fun last Thursday. There was not a House. We were counted out and therefore had to come back to the same matter today.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howie, said that there were so few people in the Chamber to listen on that occasion that he believed everyone must be in favour of his amendment. He was quite sure that everyone had studied his speech. I know that most noble Lords make a point of studying the speeches of the noble Lord, Lord Howie, rather than anyone else's. Whether that happened on this occasion, I am not certain; but there are more people here to make up for it today than there were the other day.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I wonder whether the noble Earl would tempt me into repeating the whole of my speech last Thursday, lest noble Lords have not had the advantage of reading it in Hansard. They may enjoy it all the more.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-05_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I would not wish to weary the intellectual capacity of your Lordships by doing that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para3"></a>The fact is that we are trying to deal with a difficult matter. There is a difference between arbitration and adjudication. Put simply, in arbitration one waits until the end of the contract. One has a full-blown argument about it, perhaps in the courts with barristers and heaven <P>


<a name="column_17"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 17</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>knows what. It may take a year or two years to get to the end of it. Adjudication is an attempt to resolve the matter forthwith. On too many occasions in the past contracts have been made with adjudication clauses in them; but they have been cut out because the big boys believe it is easier not to have such clauses. Therefore, any matter that arises falls to be dealt with by arbitration. That can be adverse for the small contractor.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para4"></a>All that we have tried to do here is to ensure that if the process proposed in the Bill is adhered to, there should be an adjudication process which will end up in a decision. If the two parties to the contract do not want to make that decision binding, they have to say so before they go to adjudication. If they do not say so, then they agree that it should be binding. The adjudicator makes his decision, and it is binding.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para5"></a>If one were to accept that that was a pity and that there was cause for complaint or appeal, it means that the adjudication process is almost meaningless because it can be rehashed at the end of the contract by going to arbitration. The whole point of the clause is to try to avoid that. All I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Howie, is that if they do not want to do that, most contractors would have their own contracts setting out the terms and conditions of the contract; the terms and conditions of adjudication; and the terms of arbitration. It is only if the parties do not do that that the clause falls to operate. If Clause 111 is a little more harsh than most contracts, so be it. That may encourage people to include a more modest clause in their contracts.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para6"></a>One must remember that the whole point of Clause 111 is to provide something which has not been provided for in the contract between the two parties. If they want to avoid Clause 111, all they have to do is to set out their own requirements in their own contract. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said that this is arbitration and adjudication muddled up, and that we should ask the industry. That is precisely what we are doing. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, said on Second Reading that they wanted to see what the Government had in mind. So we tried to produce a draft scheme--my noble friend Lord Ullswater was right; it is a draft scheme--to show the kind of things that we have in mind. We tried to be helpful. It is always fatal to try to be helpful when in government because if one is the Tower of Babel falls down upon one, and everyone says, "You should not do that."
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para7"></a>We tried to be helpful. We produced the draft scheme to show what we have in mind. The draft scheme has gone out not just to Members of this place, but to members of the industry. When we have heard the results of that consultation--of which, if I may say so with respect, this Committee stage is one aspect--we shall decide what shall be put into the draft proposals. They will go out for statutory consultation once the Bill becomes law. There has been a considerable amount of consultation over this point.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para8"></a>I do not for one moment suggest that we have the thing 100 per cent. right. But Members of the Committee asked what it is that the Government intend to do, so we have produced a draft scheme to show what <P>


<a name="column_18"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it is we intend to do. Some Members of the Committee have said, "Let us take it away and produce another one". I believe that it was the noble Lord, Lord Williams, and I think that that was a churlish suggestion. How can we take something away that we have just issued to other people to consider, and produce another one? We want to get the preliminary consultation over. We want to find out what people say and what the Committee says. We shall produce a further document in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para9"></a>I come back to the original point. So much time in the past has been wasted by people arguing about construction contracts, and so forth, and there has been no method of conciliation. We have put into the Bill a fall-back position which means that if contracts do not have within them a method of arbitration or adjudication, then the parties can fall back to Clause 111. If they do not want to fall back to Clause 111, all they have to do is to put it in their own contracts. That is why I believe that Clause 111 is important.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   There is no point the Minister saying that adjudication should be introduced, because it has been there since time immemorial. The ideas he has put forward are the common currency of construction contracts, and he knows that. I am greatly encouraged by the speech the Minister has just made. It is clear that he is now beginning to understand the difference between arbitration and adjudication. That was not clear on Second Reading. It is clear that he has now grasped that distinction. It is a distinction which is extremely important in the construction industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para10"></a>I have just one last thing to say. Although the Minister now grasps that distinction, the scheme does not grasp that distinction. As I said, the scheme is largely lifted, holus-bolus, from the Arbitration Bill, which is a different thing, and deals with different matters. That has now to be thought about.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para11"></a>Now that the Minister has reconstructed his attitude towards the distinction that I have been making for some time, will he make that same distinction in the scheme? When I suggested that the scheme should be replaced by the scheme for conciliation from the Institution of Civil Engineers, their sixth edition scheme, I was proposing something with which the industry is already well acquainted, and with which it is already comfortable. It is much more significant since the whole point of this part of the Bill is to reduce costs, conflict, and dispute, and to put in propositions which the industry already understands and with which it is already comfortable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-05_para12"></a>I am, as I say, greatly pleased by the Minister's movement in thinking. I urge him to continue that progress just a little further. Then he and I are in some kind of asymptotic condition--coming closer together--although I should say that the problem here is that asymptotes never actually meet. I am hoping that we achieve a readjustment of geometry, and that on this occasion the asymptotes actually meet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   All the points that I could make have been made. The Minister has made his point. There is one fundamental point about the jurisdiction of the adjudicator under the scheme. When it comes to the end, the scheme says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The right of appeal from the decision of the court on the substantial jurisdiction of an adjudicator shall be governed by the same rules as if the adjudicator were an arbitrator". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is our basic problem. Either it is a scheme for adjudication or it is a scheme for arbitration. In the Bill, in the Government's view, and in the Latham Report, it should be a scheme for adjudication, which is quite different from arbitration.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-06_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I could say, but I shall not say it because it is not totally true, that adjudication and arbitration are matters of semantics. They are not. They are different, but they are confusing words.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-06_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, said that adjudication has always been there. It is true that it has. There is no doubt that what we are trying to do is to have a system of adjudication which speeds the process of arbitration. It is a difficult balance to strike, because under the old system of adjudication one could have a contract going ahead. There is then a row and someone says, "I am owed &#163;50,000." The adjudicator comes along and says, "No, you are owed only &#163;40,000". That is accepted and the work goes on. Then about two years later everything is blown apart, and the matter goes to arbitration. All that adjudication can be too easily lost. Then the parties become involved with the enormous expense of arbitration.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-06_para1"></a>Although it is not easy, we have tried to stop that exercise being protracted so far down the line and being enormously expensive by saying, "Let us have an adjudication principle which is quick, simple and cheaper and which is binding upon the two people unless in advance they say that they do not want it to be binding". If they do not say that in advance, it is reasonable to say that it is binding.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-06_para2"></a>That is where there is a difficulty between arbitration and adjudication. There will be no simple answer but we believe that our proposal is good because it provides clarity, expediency, and reasonable justice. The noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, said that I was an asymptote. I am sure that I am, but I am not certain what I am supposed to do--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   The Minister is not an asymptote; he is pursuing an asymptotic path. However, he would make an excellent asymptote if he were one.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-06_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I am not an asymptote and neither am I a butterfly. That is good because I am following an asymptote's path. That is interesting because I did not know that I had done so. We are using the mechanism of arbitration--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   Would it be unreasonable to ask the noble Lord, Lord Howie, to explain what the curious creature is because I am sure that nine-tenths of us do not have a clue?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I shall try to help because I am a helpful kind of fellow. I am sure that nine-tenths <P>


<a name="column_20"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 20</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the Committee know perfectly well what it is. It is a term of geometry. It consists of two geometric paths which approach each other but never actually reach. It is a little like trying to convince the Government of anything at all.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-06_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   As usual, I am deeply indebted to the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, because she had the temerity to ask the question that I did not dare ask for fear of being considered by the Committee far too ignorant. Of course, I am because I had not the slightest idea of what an asymptote was nor what its path was. I thought that it was some kind of animal, but I discover that it is a geometric path. I am sure that the noble Baroness always walks down geometric paths and knows exactly where she is when she does so. I am sure that we are all grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Howie, for the total and gross distraction from our consideration of Clause 111.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-06_para3"></a>We are trying to use the mechanism of arbitration, which is conveniently set out in the Arbitration Bill. The mechanism will be guided by the principles of adjudication and not of arbitration. I return to a point that I made once or twice and I ask the indulgence of the Committee in making it again. This is not an easy matter. We are trying to stop an elongated process and to make it shorter, simpler and more concise. We are trying to introduce a process which, in the end, will cost the industry a great deal less and will give satisfaction to the whole of industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-06_para4"></a>That is what we have suggested in the draft scheme and it remains for us to hear what those involved think about it. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, asked what we had heard about it during the weekend. We have heard some sympathetic remarks about our draft scheme. Some people have contacted us saying that they believe it to be a good idea. That is the beginning of the consultation. We have put it out for Members and those in the various parts of industry to consider before we get too far. I hope that members of the Committee will consider that we have been understanding and have produced a scheme which they can criticise--regrettably they have criticised it--and we can take that into account before we produce the next scheme.

</P>
The Lord Privy Seal (

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-07_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne): </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister on the meeting of the European Council in Turin on 29th March. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "60401-07_para0"></a>"The purpose of the meeting was to launch the Inter-Governmental Conference aimed at preparing the European Union for the next phase of enlargement. The Council conclusions, which I have placed in the Library, set out the main areas of the IGC's agenda.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para1"></a>"We have ensured that the conclusions do not prejudice the actual negotiations in any way; nor do they contain an exhaustive list of the issues for negotiation. We shall pursue our objectives for the development of Europe as a partnership of nations, as set out in the Government's recent White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para2"></a>"The negotiations themselves will now begin. They may well last for a year or longer. Foreign Ministers will meet every month. Their personal representatives will meet every week.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para3"></a>"I outlined to the European Council the Government's approach to the IGC. I made clear that our vision of Europe is built around the bedrock of the nation state. I also set out some of the areas where the UK will be putting forward proposals, and those where we have strong views.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para4"></a>"For example, I underlined the need for the principle of subsidiarity to be enshrined in the treaty; the value of a greater role for national parliaments; our desire to see Europe's common foreign and security policy work better, while preserving its basis of unanimity; the need for further progress in <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_23"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 23</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>co-operation in justice and home affairs, without undermining its essential intergovernmental nature; our opposition to any further extension of qualified majority voting; and our insistence on reforms for the working of the European Court of Justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para5"></a>"I also made clear to the European Council my particular concern about the recent opinion of the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice on the Working Time Directive, and its implications for the IGC. I said that I was not prepared to see our Social Chapter opt-out undermined as a result of an expansive and unreasonable interpretation of the health and safety article of the treaty. I made clear that I would be looking in the IGC for changes to that article, to reflect our earlier understanding of its limited scope.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para6"></a>"The European Council also held a brief discussion on employment and competitiveness. This subject will rightly be high on the agenda of its meeting in Florence in June. I set out this Government's views.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para7"></a>"Europe has to be globally competitive. Jobs are not created by governments, still less by the European Union. They come from the decisions of businesses in the marketplace. Job creation needs less regulation, not more; lower financial and other burdens on business, not extra impositions arising from ill-conceived European directives.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para8"></a>"There is increasing understanding of these realities among some of our European partners. I was encouraged by the discussion. But I will continue to resist strongly any suggestion that the treaty be amended to cover employment issues. Action in those areas is overwhelmingly for individual countries, not for the EU collectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para9"></a>"All the heads of state and government in Turin were acutely conscious of the Europe-wide crisis in the beef market. This is, and was treated as, an entirely separate issue from the IGC agenda. There was no question in anyone's mind of trading help in one area against co-operation in the other.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para10"></a>"I told my colleagues of the impact in this country of the ban on British beef decided in Brussels last week; particularly as it was taken on the basis of considerations other than the scientific advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para11"></a>"I suggested to my colleagues that three things were now needed. First, the conditions should be created as speedily as possible to allow the ban on British beef exports to be lifted. Second, the specific problems of the UK beef market had to be addressed. I looked to the Community for sympathetic and speedy support for the measures necessary to return confidence and stability to the market. Third, it should be recognised that this was a European, not just a British, problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para12"></a>"The response of my European colleagues was, without exception, one of support. There was universal agreement that this was a Europe-wide problem, and that a European solution was required. All heads of state and government who spoke <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_24"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 24</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>expressed readiness to see the EU bear a share of the financial burden and recalled the EU help in the swine fever epidemic a few years ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para13"></a>"This was a welcome response, in tone as well as substance. But we still have some way to go. Negotiations continue with the Commission on the measures needed to restore confidence. My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture is in Luxembourg today to take this forward and to attend a meeting of European Ministers of Agriculture.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para14"></a>"I emphasised to my European colleagues that, with the measures we have taken, British beef is, on any normal definition of the term, safe. No one disputed this. Everyone recognised that the present crisis came not from a real health risk but from unnecessary hysteria across Europe.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para15"></a>"At Turin the IGC was launched with an agenda which enables us to pursue our objectives in a non-prejudicial climate. I was able to make clear to my European colleagues our strong views on certain key issues, including what is needed to tackle unemployment across Europe as well as in Britain. And we achieved a notable measure of understanding and support over the beef crisis that we and our European partners now face together.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para16"></a>"The need now is to turn this support into action, particularly the lifting of the export ban on British beef and beef products. That is our immediate objective. It is important; and we are pursuing it urgently".
<P>
</UL>
<A NAME = "60401-07_para17"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_time1"></A><H5>4 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Viscount the Leader of the House for repeating the Statement that his right honourable friend the Prime Minister made in another place. I shall begin by saying a few words about beef. I do not want to spend too much time on that subject, because I believe that the rest of the report is extremely important. We welcome the support that the Prime Minister received from his colleagues in Turin; indeed, he was at one time reported as having said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I wish the Euro-sceptics back in Britain could be in this room now to see how European solidarity works in practice". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I wonder whether the noble Viscount the Leader of the House could confirm whether or not his right honourable friend the Prime Minister actually uttered those words and tell us whether they remain his view.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para18"></a>Today is perhaps not the time to discuss the Government's responsibility for the crisis in the beef industry. However, perhaps I may be forgiven for noting in passing that the Government seemed to spend an awful lot of time this weekend trying to persuade the country that it was anyone's fault except their own. Nevertheless, we can debate that issue in more detail on April 17th when the House will consider the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para19"></a>Can the noble Viscount tell the House, first, when the Government expect the package of measures on beef to emerge from the various discussions that are now taking place? Clearly it is in everyone's interests that that <P>


<a name="column_25"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 25</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be sooner rather than later. Secondly, can the noble Viscount say whether or not any compensation which comes from Brussels in respect of what we may have to pay to resolve the crisis in this country is to come out of Britain's budget rebate? There have been reports in the press to that effect. Therefore, a certain amount of clarity from the Government on the matter would be helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para20"></a>I turn now to the IGC. I do not suggest that noble Lords should ignore the Statement but, as is well known, I have said on a number of occasions when dealing with such Statements that it is most important that one looks at the communique and not at the gloss that any national leader or national Minister puts upon what was actually agreed and the document to which the Prime Minister put his hand. I shall, therefore, concentrate on the communique.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para21"></a>Although it was clearly overshadowed by beef, I believe that it is worth while spending a moment or two on the contents of the communique. The communique expresses and welcomes the fact that the intergovernmental conference is the first step towards,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Does that remain the policy of Her Majesty's Government? The communique also states that the
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Union [is] firmly committed to the full implementation of the Treaties, including ... economic and monetary union". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I know that the Government negotiated an opt-out, but is it their policy--and, indeed, does it remain their policy--that the Union is firmly committed to economic and monetary union?
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para22"></a>The communique also sets out an agenda for the IGC and, indeed, points the direction very clearly as regards the areas in which the IGC is to work. A number of issues are, therefore, highlighted. First, how to strengthen human rights. That is firmly in the communique. I assume that that is to be within the framework of the existing institutions. I should like to know how the Government see a drive at the IGC in order to strengthen human rights and reinforce and buttress them. We have not heard very much about that recently, and a little clarity in that respect might be helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para23"></a>Secondly, the communique calls for an examination and,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"strengthened control of the Union's external frontiers ... [including] coherent and effective asylum, immigration and visa policies". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Is that the Government's policy? Is that the direction in which we wish the IGC to go and which we hope it will eventually recommend? Then, after those words about asylum and immigration policies it says, "clearing"--that is a strange word--

together with "supplementary coordinated action". Again, I am not quite sure what that means and I would be most grateful if the noble Viscount could tell us what the Prime Minister intended the IGC to be considering when he agreed that that is what it should consider.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para25"></a>On the institutions, the communique calls for examination of a number of things and for,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"simplifying legislative procedures and ... widening ... codecision". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Are we, or are we not, in favour of that? If we are in favour of simplifying legislative procedures, how would we like to simplify them within the European Union? If we are in favour of widening codecision, how and in what areas do we propose that it should be widened? Presumably the Prime Minister has some idea of what he wants otherwise he would not have signed the communique pointing the IGC firmly in that direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para26"></a>The communique talks about "the role" and composition of the European Parliament and a,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"uniform procedure for its election". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Are we in favour of such a Europe-wide procedure in terms of the European Parliament election? Again, I assume that the Prime Minister knew what it was that he had in mind when he signed the communique pointing the IGC in that direction. It would be nice if someone could let us in on the secret. There is also reference to qualified "majority voting", "the weighting of votes" and,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the threshold for qualified majority decisions". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The Government say that they are very much against qualified majority voting, although I have recently detected what is perhaps a slight, and to be encouraged, tendency on the part of the Prime Minister to resile somewhat from the starkness of the undertaking that he gave on the David Frost television programme in February.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para27"></a>I turn now to a very strange and difficult paragraph which appears on page 5 of the communique and which talks of introducing,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"rules [to enable] a certain number of Member States to develop a strengthened cooperation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
What does that mean? I assume that someone on the Government's side knows what it means. However, I wonder whether that is pointing the IGC in the direction of creating a two-stage Europe; namely, one in which a number of states go in one direction and a number of other states go in another direction. If the Government consider that that is what the IGC should be spending its time doing, perhaps they had better tell us which of the two stages it wants the United Kingdom to be in.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para28"></a>Finally, there is a plea in the communique for,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a greater capacity ... [and coherence in] foreign policy", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and the possibility of the European Union,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"expressing itself in a more visible and coherent way and with a more perceptible face and voice". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Yet again, I assume that the Prime Minister had something in his mind when he agreed that the IGC should consider that and pointed it in that direction. If we are in favour of European foreign policy being <P>


<a name="column_27"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more visible and coherent and having a more perceptible face and voice, I should be grateful to be told so today by the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para29"></a>The points that I have made are not nit-picking points; indeed, they are fundamental points. They are points on which the British Government, through the voice and pen of the Prime Minister, have said that the intergovernmental conference (which is sitting for a year) should be beavering away to try to produce answers to such problems. I cannot believe the Government agreed that they should all go to the IGC, thinking that, perhaps, they had no view on the matter and would not take part in any discussions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para30"></a>The question raised is: how much of all that is United Kingdom Government policy? How can the Prime Minister sign up in Turin to this and then pretend that it does not, and would not, involve greater integration? Of course it would. If carried into practice, it would be bound to involve greater majority voting in the Council, an enhanced role for the European Parliament, a common immigration and asylum policy and a much more co-ordinated European foreign policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-07_para31"></a>Coupled with the agreements we made at Maastricht, this document, and the direction in which the IGC was pointed by the Prime Minister when he signed it, amounts to a significant step towards the creation of a European Union and a further curtailment of the United Kingdom's right of independent action. I am not necessarily against some of this, speaking personally, but a policy of signing up to one thing in Europe and then pretending otherwise at home is both disingenuous, and in the end it will be self-defeating. The truth is that if we believe what they say, they have agreed to virtually nothing; if we believe what they have signed up to as the agenda for the IGC, they have agreed to a lot. Just for once it would be pleasant to know the Government's true position. One can, of course, understand the limitations on governmental transparency imposed by the current situation inside the Conservative Party, but the time has surely come when this open Government should be a little more open with the country as to where they really stand.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60401-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches also wish to thank the noble Viscount the Leader of the House for repeating the Statement. The report, of course, is about the preparations for the beginning of the IGC, but judging from the press and judging from much comment that has been made, it is somewhat overwhelmed by the subject of beef, which is a subject on which we have perhaps heard rather a little too much over the past fortnight.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para0"></a>The Prime Minister must be glad to realise that the beef issue is recognised as a European issue. Perhaps he and the Government also accept that it is a good thing that it is recognised as a European issue. If we were not--I would not say at the heart of Europe--at least inside the European Union, we should have a great deal more trouble in dealing with our beef problem than we have at the present time. It is certainly welcome that our partners in the European Union are prepared to help with the financial implications. Incidentally, has anyone <P>


<a name="column_28"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 28</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ever discovered how much BSE there is among our European partners? I know nothing about agriculture but I find it extremely difficult to believe that this unpleasant germ or condition--who knows what it is?--is confined to these islands. The fact that we are not told of the numbers of cases in other countries does not necessarily mean that they do not exist. Did we extract any information about the extent of the beef problem, or rather the potential for a beef problem, in these other countries, if that information were more widely available? Perhaps the noble Viscount can enlighten us about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para1"></a>On the subject of beef, it is good that there were negotiations and discussions about it, but surely the most important thing is to achieve a settlement of some kind as fast as possible. There can be no doubt whatever that there are a great many people in this country at the moment who think that they are likely to be broke by the end of next week unless the Government make a clear decision. As we are operating in what I humbly suggest is almost Cloud-cuckoo-town in regard to beef--the whole matter is in a realm of unreality--can we not just cut through it all, regardless of what comes out from Europe, and get on with it? That is what is urgently needed as regards the rural areas of this country. We need a decision to be made quickly so that people know where they stand. I hope we can be told how much help we shall receive and how quickly it will be given, but we need to come to a decision, whatever else there is to be done about the beef issue in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para2"></a>Listening to the noble Viscount repeating the Statement I tried again to ascertain what the meeting was supposed to be about. I understand from the first page of the document that it is supposed primarily to be about enlargement. However, I see remarkably little within the Statement that tells us what will happen in relation to enlargement, and yet a great many of the issues that are raised should be very much about enlargement. The Statement refers to the problem of unemployment in the Union. The reference to enlargement is on the first page of the document if the noble Viscount the Leader of the House has overlooked it. The question of enlargement is surely at the heart of what is going on in relation to the IGC.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para3"></a>Unemployment is an extremely important issue in the European Union, and we all recognise that. For the Government to harp on about the effect of the social chapter really is to be straining at gnats and swallowing camels. Surely the most important issue in connection with enlargement is what its effect will be on employment in the better off countries with high standards of living inside the European Union when enlargement will bring in countries whose labour costs are so much lower. Yet, if we do not accept their goods, that makes extreme nonsense of any talk about enlargement. I am astonished that nowhere in the document is there any reference to what we will do about the problems arising from enlargement both in relation to the CAP and in relation to unemployment. To talk about the unemployment question and not to discuss it in relation to those countries with low costs which are to come into the Union seems to me to be missing the point in a most spectacular way.
<P>


<a name="column_29"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 29</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para4"></a>The first two pages of the document are almost entirely devoted to stating that the Government are in fact Gaullists and that they believe in a union des patries, and not in any sense in a federal Europe. They use the word "federal"--as I would--in the sense in which it is understood in every country except Great Britain. Great Britain manages to create a bogey of federalism by misinterpreting the use of the word. Those of us who are strongly federal in the European sense are totally in support of subsidiarity. In fact in many ways we are more in support of subsidiarity than are Her Majesty's Government. However, that does not emerge.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para5"></a>The Government seem to think that they can go ahead with enlargement and yet maintain in every possible way national control over all the issues. Yet another inevitable consequence of enlargement is that we have to look at qualified majority voting. Again, in the Statement, the Government refer to qualified majority voting but they do not refer to the effect that enlargement will have on the whole question of voting. How can one possibly contemplate enlargement without saying how on earth one will make decisions when there are 17 or 25 countries who do not have the opportunity for qualified majority voting? It is "Hamlet" without the prince to have an IGC on the subject of enlargement and to leave those questions totally unanswered.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-08_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I shall try to answer both the noble Lord and the noble Baroness as succinctly as I can. However, it will be a challenge in view of the number of questions that the noble Lord, Lord Richard, asked me. The noble Lord, Lord Richard, asked me two questions about beef. The first concerned when the Government package of measures would emerge. If I may, I shall link that to my response to the entirely justified urging of the noble Baroness that speed was of the essence in the restoration of confidence in the beef market. My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture is in Luxembourg today discussing this issue with the Commission with the absolute endorsement of Her Majesty's Government, aiming to agree a package of measures to help restore confidence in beef right across Europe as swiftly as possible. The Government are all too well aware--as the noble Baroness pointed out--of the large number of jobs which depend directly and indirectly on the beef industry. The number of beef products spreads almost throughout the economic endeavour in this country. So it is essential that this period of uncertainty should be brought to a close as swiftly as possible. I hope that the eradication of BSE and the market support measures which my right honourable friend has discussed, and is discussing today, will be a welcome step towards getting the EU ban lifted, which I think is a prerequisite to the restoration of confidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para6"></a>The noble Lord's second question concerned compensation and whether it would come out of the rebate. It is not clear as yet what level of compensation will be payable to various interested parties. It will depend entirely on what measures emerge. It is important that when the measures emerge we should make it perfectly clear as swiftly as possible how they are to be applied and how they will operate. A broad declaration will not in itself restore confidence. What <P>


<a name="column_30"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 30</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will restore confidence is the clarity with which Her Majesty's Government set out their proposals; and I hope that that will be possible in a very few days.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para7"></a>The question of compensation will have to be addressed at that point. However, I remind the noble Lord that measures on calves and a number of market support measures have been announced by my right honourable friend. The question of intervention is one to which the rules apply. A broadening of the rules and categories of intervention may emerge from my right honourable friend's discussions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para8"></a>I turn to matters of the IGC. The noble Lord, Lord Richard, as always--he drew our attention to this fact--looked at the communique. I make no complaint about that. However, he forgot one thing, if I may so suggest, in his clear indication that the Government had not taken any trouble to set out their own policy. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Richard, has not forgotten the recent White Paper which published the negotiating objectives of Her Majesty's Government in the IGC. I am sure that what was set out in the White Paper has been part of the noble Lord's daily reading. However, I remind him that among our objectives set out clearly in that document has been the further entrenchment of subsidiarity in the treaty and action to ensure that the treaty articles are not misused. Indeed, my right honourable friend made it clear in his Statement that we feel that Article 118a, on health and safety, has been misused by the Commission, an issue on which we hope to get action during the course of the IGC. We hope to achieve improvements in the quality of legislation through better consultation and the automatic withdrawal of proposals not adopted within a given period. We do not want any more powers for the European Parliament at the expense of national parliaments or governments. We believe that the foreign and defence policy must remain the responsibility of national governments and that NATO should remain the bedrock of western security.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para9"></a>That is all fairly well ploughed ground; I could go on. However, there are some signs that our European partners are beginning at least to move in the direction that we have set out. I draw the noble Lord's attention in particular to the French Prime Minister's recent speech in which he underlined the central role in the European Union of the nation state and the supremacy of the Council of Ministers over the Commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para10"></a>In his reference to the final document, the noble Lord asked a number of questions. I believe that an ever closer union among peoples is clearly an objective which the Government can sign up to. After all, as set out in the White Paper, we fully support a strengthened co-operation and friendship across the whole of Europe. I suggest to your Lordships that that is not the same as an ever closer federal union of states--"federal" in the sense that we understand it in this country rather than as it is understood abroad, as the noble Baroness said.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para11"></a>As regards the strengthening of human rights, I believe that our position is perfectly clear. The fundamental human rights are already protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. All member states and the European Union are bound to respect that <P>


<a name="column_31"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>convention. As your Lordships know, the ECHR is already enforceable through its commission and through the court. The Government see no need for duplication of the ECHR in the EU treaty. I believe that there has been an Advocate-General's opinion supporting that view in the past few days.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para12"></a>I also point out to the noble Lord, Lord Richard, that unemployment, the institutions, the widening of co-decision, simplifying procedures, the extension of QMV, rules to strengthen co-operation, and so on, are already well on the agenda so far as concerns European meetings. It seems perfectly sensible that those matters should be discussed. I am sure the noble Lord will realise that the fact they are discussed does not necessarily mean that Her Majesty's Government feel able to sign up to all of them. Indeed, they may not feel able to sign up to many of them--but that could be said also of a number of our European partners. However, if some of our partners wish to see those issues on the agenda, it is much better in the tradition of representative government to discuss whether they are to be accepted or rejected rather than that they should be swept under the carpet and not explored.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para13"></a>Rather than weary your Lordships with a long exposition on the common foreign and security policy, perhaps I may refer the noble Lord, Lord Richard, to the speech which my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary delivered recently in Paris. It set out our views very clearly indeed. In particular, my right honourable friend made it perfectly clear that it would be sensible for us to develop a common policy; and that it would be very much better if that policy were developed by consensus rather than by majority voting in the sense that it is much easier to ensure that there are no divisive votes on anything which can be of critical importance to individual countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para14"></a>It must be fair to say to the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, that a number of those areas, in particular as regards qualified majority voting, are integral to the question of enlargement. For reasons greater than the question of internal government of the European Union, I think that all noble Lords will agree that we must pursue enlargement with the utmost vigour. I am sure that the noble Baroness would agree with that. Nevertheless, unless we are able to find practical mechanics to enable enlargement to occur, that very desirable objective will be kicked further into the distance with considerable malign consequences for the future stability not only of central and eastern Europe but, I suspect, of western Europe, too. Therefore it is important that we should examine the matters to which the noble Baroness drew attention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para15"></a>Finally, I wish to draw your Lordships' attention to the social chapter, to which the noble Baroness referred. It was perfectly right, in my view, for so much of the time of those who prepared for this European Council, and the conversation during the course of the European Council to concentrate on unemployment. It has become perhaps the greatest scourge for the membership of the European Union. Her Majesty's Government are clear that the way to address the scourge is broadly through the economic policies we have been endeavouring to <P>


<a name="column_32"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pursue in this country for some years. It is a matter of deregulation, of supply side reforms, rather than the more prescriptive and expensive methods which have increasingly come to dominate attempted solutions by our European partners.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para16"></a>With the greatest diffidence, I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Richard, that the statistics are beginning to give a hint, at the least, that we may have had a point all along. Our unemployment statistics, from far too a high a peak, have fallen since 1992 by 0.75 million. In the past three years we have created over 0.5 million new jobs. Our European partners have not had the same experience: they have high non-wage employment costs which we have managed increasingly to shed. The inward investment record of this country compared with that of our partners in Europe seems to show that many investors from outside western Europe agree with us. Therefore, I hope that in the run-up to the next general election the noble Lord will consider whether he feels that it is sensible--I put the point to him in the spirit of delightful amity and partnership which I hope he will agree we have developed during the past two years--to continue to advocate adherence to the social chapter and other matters which seem to obsess his party. Perhaps he will consider whether there are any votes in it from his point of view.

<A NAME="60401-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the Rome Treaty was designed about 40 years ago for five nations of western Europe whose legal systems and constitutions had much in common? Even as amended, it is now quite unsuitable for an enlarged Community of 15 nations which may be further enlarged by several nations in the fairly near future. Is he aware that in the course of the IGC negotiations, attempts should therefore be made by Her Majesty's Government to persuade the other European countries to have a system based not on the Rome Treaty but on consolidation and amendment of the treaties which followed it in order to avoid the present confusion which arises in law making?
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-08_para17"></a>Is my noble friend aware that in the enlarged Community, with 11 different languages and a number of different constitutions, law making has become dilatory and cumbersome and the outcome is sometimes confusing? If the Community is to succeed in the years to come, as an enlarged Community of many different countries, we must get the constitutional position put right.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60401-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, I did not mean size to count! The Minister must be aware that his statement that in a few days we hope to be able to come to an agreement and announce the action that we shall take on beef will strike despair into many hearts in this country. We have already had the Government announcing a serious danger which might arise and then a wait while disaster struck all over Europe until the committee reported. Now, apparently, we must wait until agreement is reached in Europe. Is the noble Viscount aware that intervention will be absolutely necessary? All over Britain, particularly in Scotland, fat cattle ready for market are piling up. However big the recovery is, it will not be sufficient to take the cattle off the market. Therefore, we must have intervention buying. It must come anyhow. If it is announced now at least we can start to employ slaughtermen and ancillary trades who are at present being put out of work.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-09_para0"></a>Will the noble Viscount agree that a policy of selective slaughter, advocated by most people in this country who have thought about it, would speed the process which is already going on to reduce by at least half every year and eventually eliminate the big epidemic of BSE in this country? An announcement, without waiting to see what cash we shall receive, would contribute a great deal to the rest of the country having confidence in the Government.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-09_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I have already mentioned the importance of intervention, so I am happy to agree that it will play an important part in the resolution of the crisis. Intervention exists, and there is the possibility of widening the intervention categories.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-09_para1"></a>The noble Lord was extremely clear. I agree that it is important now to restore confidence in the consumption of beef. In Turin, my right honourable friend and his colleagues agreed that it is not only a matter for this country. I understand that the scare is beginning to have an effect on continental European beef markets as well as ours. The problem must be tackled on a European basis. That is why the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, was right when she emphasised that it was essential for Europe to move fast. That is what I hope my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture will have begun to secure today. The noble Lord is right; today will not be too soon.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Viscount aware that I agree with the Prime Minister that British beef is safe? It is probably safer than most of the beef now being imported. On the other hand, presumably the Government should ask themselves why, in that case, they plan to burn it. After all, it is someone's fault that that may happen; it could be the fault of the Opposition, the Cross Benches, I do not know. But apparently that is what will happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-09_para2"></a>We are told that Ministers at the conference were in agreement with,

I am glad to hear it. But is the noble Viscount aware that, when the Reflection Group considered the matter for many months, it submitted and recommended an agenda which did not include anything to do with economic and monetary union? Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether it is now thought or intended that the IGC will consider the whole issue of economic and monetary union?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-09_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, the question of economic and monetary union is not on the agenda of the IGC. Nevertheless, the presidency conclusions from which the noble Lord quotes make clear at the top of page 3:

I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, emphasised that fact. My right honourable friend made it clear at Turin that the over-hasty European reaction in imposing a ban, which was not supported by scientific evidence, as was admitted, had merely succeeded in deepening the crisis. I wish that more people would follow the excellent example not only of the customers of Sainsbury's over the weekend but also of your Lordships' House. I am reliably informed by my noble friend Lord Lindsay that one evening last week when, as a result of undertaking his ministerial duties, he came into the Barry Room rather late and quite rightly demanded beef, he was told that unfortunately it had run out.

<A NAME="60401-09_spnew10"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I can reassure my noble friend. There is no question of abrogating the Rome Treaty. It is perfectly clear that, if certain measures are agreed as a result of negotiations during the course of the IGC, treaty amendment may be necessary. But that is rather different from wholesale abrogation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-09_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, I gathered the impression that the Statement made in another place is somewhat softer and limper than the conclusions reached in the Government's White Paper. But I prefer to leave an assessment in greater detail for the debate which is to take place on the 15th of this month. It will also be necessary to assess the Statement in conjunction with the conclusions of the Italian presidency on 29th March. Those conclusions, for some reason, were not available until comparatively recently to me as a Member of your Lordships' House. However, they were available to the Conservative Party house magazine--the Daily Telegraph--in time for a detailed editorial to appear on the conclusions reached by the presidency. Incidentally, it was able to quote copiously from them. For the avoidance of doubt, I checked the quotations in the editorial in today's Daily Telegraph with the statements made by the presidency. They coincide. I do not like an embargo being imposed upon us that is not imposed upon other people in relation to these matters. After all, we have a fairly considerable interest in them. I should be glad if the noble Viscount would cause investigations to be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-09_para5"></a>There are just three matters of comparatively topical interest on which I should like to touch. From the Statement made in another place, I am not at all sure about the financial impact on the United Kingdom of any arrangements under consideration for aid to be given by the European Community to the United Kingdom. I noticed the observations made by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer in another place. The right honourable Member for Kingston-Upon-Thames indicated that we should, after all, only be getting back some of our own money. I draw attention to the fact that at the moment we contribute some &#163;2&#189; billion net to the Community. Although any contribution from our own money would be extremely welcome, we should not welcome the occasion, proposed by the European Parliament itself, to revise or abolish the existing arrangements relating to the United Kingdom's rebate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-09_para6"></a>Other matters dealt with in the Statement relate to the beef issue upon which I am no expert other than as a very avid consumer of the product. What bothers me a little--my understanding of the position may be wrong--is that the European Community arrogated to itself the right to instruct us not to send our beef to countries outside the European Union; in other words, there was an embargo against our exporting to anyone at all, let alone to the European Community. I should be glad to be corrected on that point. If it were true that the Community sought to ban British exports from here to, <P>


<a name="column_36"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>say, the United States or any other country outside the Community, I should strongly dissent. I shall be glad if the noble Viscount will say whether or not that is true. If it is true, it should be resisted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-09_para7"></a>Finally, in the communique there is inserted--according to the Daily Telegraph--at the express behest of the French Government, the suggestion that the IGC could also address the question of the compatibility between competition and the principles of universal access to essential services in the citizens' interest. I shall be glad if the noble Viscount can elucidate exactly what is meant by that suggestion in the presidency conclusions because many might think that it is in contradiction of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-09_para8"></a>I hope that the noble Viscount will be able to give some enlightenment on those matters.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-10_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, first, I shall certainly investigate the noble Lord's complaint about the availability of the conclusions to a certain newspaper before either he or I had seen them. Perhaps I may write to him. It is perfectly clear that draft conclusions have been floating about the European ether for some weeks if not months. I am not entirely clear whether, in fact, a certain newspaper had access to a final version of the conclusions before the noble Lord or I saw them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para0"></a>So far as the legality of the European ban on British beef exports is concerned, I am advised that there is a reasonable legal basis for what the Commission has done. However, as your Lordships will be aware, different lawyers often have different views on these matters. Her Majesty's Government are examining the true worth of that legal basis with some expedition. I do not want to raise the hopes of the noble Lord too high because the advice we received comes from eminent sources.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para1"></a>In relation to the access to universal services, it is no secret that there are some countries among our European partners who feel that there should be a social and national element involved in the provision of services from utilities. It is perfectly clear from the record of Her Majesty's Government in that respect that the standard of services provided by utilities and, indeed, the price of those services in the first instant has gone up and in the second has gone down as a result of the policies we pursued which have had rather more of a commercial edge. It seems to us that--how can I put it without offending the noble Lord too much?--the rather more socialist traditions of some partners is not always in the best interests of the consumer, which is what we are pursuing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I can draw out my noble friend on one matter which he mentioned; that is, enlargement. That is generally regarded to be a good thing. My noble friend referred to practical mechanics being necessary. Do the Government accept that for enlargement, reform of the common agricultural policy will be necessary? If so, are they mindful of the fact that of the 87 votes which exist in the Council, only 26 constitute a blocking minority? Further, in relation to the mechanics of the treaty, the communique says that,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the implementation of the convergence criteria for the achievement of the economic and monetary union [is necessary]. However, supplementary coordinated action is necessary". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Does my noble friend agree that if the convergence criteria slip, that will give Her Majesty's Government the opportunity to use Article N of the treaty and prevent any further monetary union unless we get back most of the things that we want from our European partners?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-10_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I am conscious that our time is up. However, we feel strongly that CAP reform should lie high on the agenda, not only for reasons allied to our hope for enlargement of the Community, but also for reasons of good sense in relation to the administration of the CAP. My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture issued a glossy document some months ago which set out some of our initial thoughts on the subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para2"></a>With regard to the second point of my noble friend, he is pursuing a matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Richard. I refer him to the answer I gave.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon  </B>   moved Amendment No. 198:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 64, line 6, at end insert ("together with all days forming part of a customary holiday period within the industry in question").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: We can move from the general and important to the particular and no less important. We have almost reached the end of Part II of the Bill which deals with the construction industry, a part with which I felt, from time to time, that the Government were not entirely comfortable, though many others found the whole thing plain sailing. Amendment No. 198 is a simple amendment and I hope that the Government accept it without any undue alarm or despondency. It is a detailed contractual matter relating to periods of time and calculation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para7"></a>As the Bill stands, it allows for the period of time to exclude such days as Christmas Day, Good Friday or Bank Holidays in England and Wales and, indeed, Scotland. The amendment seeks to extend that exclusion to include what are the natural and usual customary holidays in the area where the contract is carried out. By that I mean such things as Wakes Week in the north of England, the Glasgow Fair in the west of Scotland or similar traditional holidays. I have nothing further to say on the matter except that I expect the Government to agree with what I say and I hope that in his reply the noble Earl will make that clear. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My noble friend Lord Howie has a point. It is difficult in timetabling simply to concentrate on what is statutory time rather than what is conventional time within the industry with which we are dealing. Though I accept that it may be difficult to <P>


<a name="column_38"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 38</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>include my noble friend's amendment in the Bill immediately, I hope that the Government will accept that there are arrangements within the industry which are generally acknowledged and which would make the timetable specified in the Bill difficult for them to meet on certain occasions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-10_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Howie, says that this is a simple amendment and he is sure that the Government will be able to accept it. But the noble Lord, Lord Williams, sees a difficulty. In fact, so do I.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para8"></a>I have a lot of sympathy with the suggestion that customary holidays should be discounted from the time periods mentioned in the Bill. But I wonder how practical that would be. It may vary from place to place or even from site to site. The last thing we want to create is a source of dispute about the precise timing of deadlines.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para9"></a>It may be that some builders take two weeks off over Christmas or during the summer so that everyone can go on holiday at the same time. It would be difficult and, indeed, unfair to take that into account in that the payee may have to wait an extra two weeks for his money. Many of the time periods mentioned in the Bill concern payment or the transmission of information. I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Howie, that, so long as the banks are operating and postal services are working, there is little justification in discounting certain special days. It would not be fair that a small businessman had to wait for his money because his employer had gone on holiday.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para10"></a>As it is written in the Bill, obvious days such as Bank Holidays, Good Friday, Christmas Day and Easter Day are all taken account of. It would be inappropriate to widen that scope.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I have known the noble Earl for the best part of 30 years and I notice that he has an unerring aim for difficulties which nobody else can see. Of course, that is part of his job.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para11"></a>As I read the Bill--I may be mistaken and no doubt the noble Earl will correct me in due course--"reckoning periods of time" relates to a variety of things. There are periods of time for payment to any contract involving extensions of time and things of that nature. But there are traditions with which the noble Earl may not be wholly aware.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para12"></a>I can remember when my father worked in Troon Shipyard. They had a local custom which was continual and traditional. They had two days off at new year--the 1st and 2nd January--and then on 3rd January the workers congregated near the shipyard and threw a brick into the air. If the brick stayed up, they went into work; if it came down again, they had a third day off. This was a traditional holiday and I have no doubt that others have similar traditions. More seriously, there are certain traditional holidays. I mentioned Wakes weeks and the Glasgow fair, both of which last two weeks or so and have great significance, especially in relation to extensions of time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para13"></a>If the noble Earl can convince me that this part of the Bill relates entirely to time in relation to payments, I may well be satisfied that he is right. But if, on the <P>


<a name="column_39"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 39</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>other hand, he does not do that and leaves hanging in the air, as it were, such matters as extensions of time--I shall try to keep talking until the noble Earl's colleague returns from his advisers--which are rather more important because they have knock-on effects in terms of such operations as follow after the extensions of time, I shall not be satisfied. An extension of time, which extends the whole contract period and impinges upon the operations of sub-contractors, other contractors and ancillary contractors, is totally different from something which is merely a matter of accountancy. I think I can probably stop now because I see that the noble Earl's colleague has returned. I should like a reply from the noble Earl.

<P>
<A NAME="60401-10_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Howie, said that he has known me for 30 years. He has indeed; he is a very lucky chap. He said that I have an erring aim for difficulties.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   An unerring aim.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-10_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   That is even worse. The curious thing is that, as far as I can see, the encroaches of senility make me seem to find everything simple. I would not want to pick an argument with anyone--least of all the noble Lord, Lord Howie. The noble Lord gave as a reason for his argument the fact that up in Scotland when they want a day off they throw a brick into the air and if it comes down they take it. That is a curious analogy to use in support of one's argument, because I do not suppose many of the bricks stay up in the air, unless it happens in Scotland where they do have very curious habits.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para14"></a>The time limits in the Bill refer to payment. They also refer to other things as well. I really do not think it possible to take these other curious, if I may so describe them, occasions, which are not national occasions or statutory occasions, and build them into the Bill because they will have different effects in different parts of the country. It seems unreasonable to tell people who are expecting money, and may be expecting some money on, say, 15th August, that everyone has gone on holiday for two weeks and they have to wait for two weeks for their money. After all, this is a case of making payments when payments are known to be expected and payments are due. I should have thought that it is perfectly reasonable to say in those circumstances that only the statutory holidays should be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-10_para15"></a>I hope that I have been able to persuade the noble Lord because, very curiously, he said that he was open to persuasion. That is an unusual facet of the noble Lord's character. I hope that I have managed to persuade him that it is better to leave the provision as it is.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60401-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I find the noble Earl's argument persuasive but only up to a point. If I heard him correctly, he said that these time matters refer to payments and other things as well. But it was the "other things as well" that I was bothered about. I said that in so far as it was a matter of payment I accepted his proposition--and I do--but matters such as extensions <P>


<a name="column_40"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 40</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of time on a contract with the consequential knock-on effects are totally different. I am not sure that he has convinced me. He has half persuaded me, as I thought he would, but he has not persuaded me wholly, because he did not apply himself to what I actually said. I think the correct thing for the noble Earl to say is that he will look at what I have said and ask me to withdraw my amendment. If he says that, I shall happily comply.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-11_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   It is a remarkable thing when the noble Lord says to me that if he were me I would say what the noble Lord thought I should say. But, as I am myself, and as I have heard the noble Lord, Lord Howie, I shall do what the noble Lord says. I shall ask him to withdraw the amendment. I shall certainly have a look at what he has said and if I have either misdirected myself or, even worse, misdirected the noble Lord, I shall certainly get in touch with him. I shall certainly look at what he has said to see whether there is anything we can do to meet that point.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   Since we seem to have changed our places in some curious way I am happy to comply with what the noble Earl suggests. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In the course of our debate in Committee on Clause 111 stand part both the noble Lord, Lord Elvel, and the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, talked about representations over the weekend. Not to be outdone, the noble Earl talked in the same spirit.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-11_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   Perhaps I may interrupt the noble Lord. He referred to the noble Lord, Lord Elvel. I think he actually meant the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. It is only a small point.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   I am most grateful. I was being economical with my language in order to shorten the remarks which I propose to make. I am grateful for the correction. I have made that mistake before and I apologise to the Committee and to the noble Lord, Lord Williams.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para4"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Williams and Lord Berkeley, talked about representations over the weekend. All I would say is that I have had many representations on behalf of 30,000 registered architects who hoped very much that Part III of the Bill, which is so important to them, would be considered last Thursday but for reasons we all know, though sunshine turned to twilight and twilight eventually turned to darkness, the House rose for unusual reasons before that part of the Bill could be reached.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para5"></a>It is a most important part of the Bill and it is for that reason very significant legislation for the profession. For more than 60 years it has depended very largely for its <P>


<a name="column_41"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 41</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>status and therefore its livelihood on the 1931 legislation. Part III of the Bill effectively amends, but in a very important and significant way, the legislation of more than 60 years ago and some subsequent amending legislation. However, there is a significant difference between the 1931 Act and Part III of the Bill which reflects our changing times. The 1931 Act was certainly seen as protecting the profession from imposters--those who claimed to be architects when they were not--and from others and, despite the support, as I shall explain, that has been given by the great majority of architects to Part III of the Bill, the Bill and Part III ought to be considered primarily as protecting the public. For that reason it is important for the Committee to look at the detail of the proposals in that spirit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para6"></a>Equally, if it is a sea change of the kind which I suggest--indeed it is as regards the further amendments to which we shall come--it is not surprising that architects have been caused some anxiety, not necessarily by what the Bill says but by details which, for one reason or another, have been omitted. My amendments are all probing amendments. At present I do not intend to press them to a Division at this stage of the Bill. The amendments are all intended to enable Ministers to place beyond all reasonable doubt what the new registration body will be like and how it will be expected to function. If, as I anticipate, helpful replies are given today of a robust and emollient kind--those two things can go together--I shall certainly not expect to press the matters further at a different stage of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para7"></a>I shall be on my feet on a number of occasions in the next hour so I shall say what I said at Second Reading. I was the director-general of the RIBA from 1987 to 1994, and a consultant for a short period afterwards. I am an honorary Fellow now. I was very much involved in the discussion of the contents of the Bill, in the first place with Sir George Young when he was a Minister, and also with the noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, and officials. All the amendments that I am putting before the Committee today have the support of the Royal Institute of British Architects though it would not necessarily agree with the way in which I shall address them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   The noble Lord has referred on a number of occasions to all the amendments. I take it that the noble Lord is speaking to a number of them at the moment. Can he tell us what the others are?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   The noble Lord anticipates by about 10 seconds what I intended to say. I thought it was important to make my position clear so that there would be no misunderstanding. The amendments stand in my name and nobody, in accordance with the proper procedures of this House, can be committed to them. Now that the Committee is preliminarily apprised of the amendments to which I shall later be speaking, I am now speaking, as the Marshalled List suggests, to Amendments Nos. 199 and 200, which go together. Amendments Nos. 212 and 213 are essentially belt and braces amendments. I do not intend to make any particular reference to them.
<P>


<a name="column_42"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 42</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para8"></a>My remarks will now be quite short in addressing Amendments Nos. 199 and 200 together. They make clear my anxiety and the area as regards which I hope the Minister will be able to help. As the Minister and the Committee may know, the Government originally had in mind to end altogether the registration of architects, but then they had a very wise change of mind. At that stage there were alternatives about how the problem of future registration might be dealt with. One possibility was that responsibility for maintaining a register of architects should be passed to the RIBA itself. Indeed, in John Warne's report to Ministers, he recommended the ending of registration. He said that were registration to continue, he thought that the best option was to pass responsibility for maintaining the register to the professional body. That was one option and most favoured by John Warne and at that time by the RIBA itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para9"></a>The second option, which was developed both among the professional bodies and in ARCUK itself, the existing registration body, which embraces registered architects who are not members of a professional body like the RIBA or its equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland, was called a "minimalist organisation". I am very glad to say that that being the alternative which was most widely favoured in the end, both by the architects themselves and by Her Majesty's Government, the Bill embodies in its detail the essentials of such a minimalist organisation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para10"></a>For example, there is a board of 15 people instead of a council of 77. It is a board shorn of the unnecessary committees which have created some problems in the past, particularly the Board of Architectural Education. I hope that the new organisation, being minimalist, is the cheapest to run although I make it clear to the Members of the Committee, if they are in doubt, that the present organisation for registration and its successor set out in the Bill, will be paid for by the profession itself. No cost falls on the public purse.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para11"></a>As I say, the direction of the Bill, as printed, is towards a minimalist organisation. I move principally these two amendments, and the others which follow from it, to make clear to the Committee that my understanding of the organisation is its understanding, too. It believes in a minimalist organisation, which will not attempt in any way to grow beyond the bounds set in statute in order to avoid any unnecessary conflict with the professional bodies which will very properly continue to represent those architects who join. The organisation will be kept as economical as possible in order, quite reasonably, to conserve the resources of a profession which, among all professions, is not a very well rewarded one. I hope that the Minister will be able to give those assurances. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Do I understand correctly that the noble Lord is not speaking to Amendments Nos. 212 and 213 at this stage?

<A NAME="60401-11_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   Perhaps I may first apologise to the House for not being here on earlier occasions. My work takes up a lot of time in the afternoons and evenings. Although I would have wished to take part in the debates on the Bill, so far, I have been unable to do so. I have come to the House particularly for Part III of the Bill. I declare to the Committee my interests. I am a chartered surveyor. I started life as a land agent. I then became a commercial agent and then a developer. I have now set up a business as an estate agent. During those times I have used the services of architects and I wish that I had not had to bother with them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para12"></a>This is the most bizarre part of the Bill. How this Government, which I support, can have changed their mind after receiving an independent report from Mr. John Warne that we should get rid of this dreadful legislation, beggars belief. I cannot follow my noble friends' thought processes. However, we have this dreadful Part III of the Bill. The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, only serve to make it even worse.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-11_para13"></a>However, I support the noble Lord on Amendment No. 200, which is reducing and minimising the cost of the board to the profession. The best way of doing that is to scrap the board and to take away the rather unique position in which architects find themselves. The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, said that the reason why architects wanted this board so much was that it protected their profession. He went on to say that it protects the public. What a load of rubbish! The public certainly do not need protection from architects. They need the greatest ability there is to seek competitive positions in this profession and from other people who can provide just the same services as architects, but much more efficiently, effectively and at a cheaper price.

<A NAME = "60401-11_para14"></a>I wonder who needs protecting from a profession that can produce a calendar for this year of 12 pretty pictures showing the designs of buildings. Five of those buildings have never been built and they are never going to be built. The great majority of the rest have been modified extensively from the original concept. Many of my own designs have had to be rescued from the hands of architects by quantity surveyors and others in the profession. There are too many buildings in this country, too many ideas and too much money has been lost as a result of bad workmanship by architects that others have luckily been able to rescue or, in many cases, not. I cannot support the thrust of Part III of the Bill. I shall argue most strongly against the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60401-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   I was going to say that I have been driven to speak by the last speaker, but I had intended to contribute anyway, so perhaps I should say--this may come as a surprise--that I am driven with alacrity to defend architects. Perhaps I should say first that I am a member of MSF, the Manufacturing, Science and Finance trades union, which currently has some difficulties with the Royal Institute of British Architects.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para0"></a>Secondly, and probably more importantly, I have used the services of architects and I have friends in the architectural profession. Furthermore, because of my <P>


<a name="column_44"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>involvement directly and indirectly with the civil engineering and building industry over a period of 30 years, I can testify to the professional competence of architects. The professional way in which they go about their business extends not only to their professional competence in a technical sense but also, generally speaking and in my experience, to the way in which they treat other professionals as well as people involved in their own business.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para1"></a>I shall concentrate my remarks on Amendment No. 200, which is grouped with Amendment No. 199. Part of my reason for speaking is that I fear that the concentration on the minimisation of costs and administrative burdens addresses only one side of the equation. We have had 17 years of this Government, whose constant cry is that they are keen on reducing taxation. We need to recognise, however, that all that they have done is to reduce the taxation levels of the very rich; the taxation burdens for the rest of us have increased. That is the first point. By concentrating on arguments about reducing taxation, the Government have lost track of the other side of the equation, which is the fact that we must be aware of the need for the provision of adequate and decent levels of service. By concentrating on just one side of the equation, the Government have effectively lost their way in terms of being a government of the country. Judging from the opinion polls, my view is shared by the vast majority of the British people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para2"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, will not take it amiss if I say that if he were to press Amendment No. 200, he would in effect be going down the same kind of road as the Government, because by concentrating on one side of the equation, if I may put it like that, there is a risk of losing sight of the other side of the equation. I hope that the noble Lord will think again about Amendment No. 200 and take on board the need to look at both sides of the equation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   I, too, am tempted to my feet by the intervention of my noble friend Lord Caithness. I had expected to say that it was a great pity that my noble friend had not been here for our earlier consideration of the Bill, but having heard his speech I am not quite sure whether that is what I want to say.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para3"></a>I am puzzled by what my noble friend said. The burden of his message was that architects are to be mistrusted and done down at every possible turn because he has had such a bad experience with them and so, he says, has everybody else. How strange, therefore, that he should object to the constitution of a body which determines who may be allowed to practise as architects, when the majority of that body is appointed to protect the public interest while only a minority is elected by the profession. I should have thought that my noble friend would argue for exactly that. I hope that he will repent of his intervention.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I, too, was a little puzzled by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. I have come over the years to respect his views on things. However, not being a member of any of the professions about which we are speaking and not belonging to any of their organisations, <P>


<a name="column_45"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 45</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>but speaking as somebody who may potentially employ the services of an architect, I would take it amiss if there were not a register of those eminent people so that I could be assured that the architect I selected had the normal, required professional qualifications. I strongly support the amendments proposed by my noble friend Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank. A simple register, administered with minimum cost, is what we require. I very much hope that my noble friend's amendments to that effect will be accepted.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am delighted that at last we have had the opportunity to hear the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, whom I had hoped to see on Thursday. He is here now, however, and in prime time and I am sure that achieving that was the real intention behind the Division on Clause 111 stand part which the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, called. I can find no other reason for that action.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para4"></a>I am rather taken by the thought that 30,000 architects are all standing up, crying out for the Bill. One wonders what would happen if one were to pile them all on top of each other. One asks oneself whether they would stand up. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Caithness would have some opinions on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para5"></a>We support this part of the Bill and the efforts made to bring the provisions to fruition by the companions in arms in architecture of the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers. Despite what my noble friend Lord Caithness said, we believe that they will prove to be a worthwhile change to the legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para6"></a>On the amendments, I find myself in the same camp as the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell. The noble Lord began by taxing my imagination and I wondered whether we were talking about the same Bill. Eventually, however, we returned to the Bill and the noble Lord supported the attitude that I shall take to Amendment No. 200. All's well that Monkswell, I suppose.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para7"></a>The aim of the amendments is to ensure that the new Architects Registration Board does not spawn several new large and expensive committees. We are certainly sympathetic to that aim. We have established a new professional conduct committee but, having abolished the Board of Architectural Education and the admission committee, the last thing we would wish to see is large new committees rising from the ashes, as it were, to take their place. I accept that such committees may be bureaucratic and expensive to run, and one of our aims in reducing the size of the Architects' Registration Council of the UK was to reduce registration costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para8"></a>We agree with the minimalist approach implied by the amendments. Our proposals would reduce the board to only 15 members and we would not wish the board to be supplemented by vast committees. However, I do not think that the proposed amendments are the right way to deal with this possibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para9"></a>While I might agree with the sentiments contained in Amendment No. 200, I do not think legislation is the right way forward. After all, any professional body is bound to act reasonably with regard to the interests of that profession, and this would include avoiding unnecessary costs.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para10"></a>There must be a certain amount of trust and a new organisation should be free to run its own affairs without having its hands tied unduly by legislation. If, at some time in the future, the board were to act in a way contrary to the spirit of this legislation, there is the possibility of changing the composition of the board both through elections and through the appointed members.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para11"></a>The proposals in Amendment No. 199 to insist on a majority of board members on all committees established by the board unnecessarily ties the hands of the board, which ought, in establishing its small, effective but inexpensive committees, to be granted the freedom to choose who should serve on them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   I, too, very much regret the fact that the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, was not able to be present on Second Reading because I thought that the points that he made were very much Second Reading points. Although I recognise their weight, I found his remarks today a little intemperate and prejudiced. If the noble Earl does not mind me saying so, the answer to his claim that the Bill is a "load of rubbish"--those were his words--although it is argued that it is designed to protect the public, was extremely well given by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, who pointed to the membership of the board, a matter to which we shall return when we reach Amendment No. 211.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para12"></a>At the time of the passage of the original legislation, the professions had much greater status and were taken for granted by the public. However, their status has changed greatly during the past 60 or more years. Although I do not necessarily agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has said about the composition of the board, the fact that by election it can be changed by that part of it which is subject to nomination is safeguard enough. I say to the noble Viscount that I would not resist an argument, if it were put forward by the profession of chartered surveyors, that it should have registration. I say cautiously that I think it is mean of him as a chartered surveyor to try to interfere with the entitlements of architects when I am sure that the great majority of that profession would not wish, in a similar way, to interfere with the wishes of the profession of surveyors, if it decided to pursue this course.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-12_para13"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lords, Lords Monkswell and Elton, and to my noble friend Lord Ezra for the support they have given to the spirit of my amendment. I am not entirely happy with what the Minister said in referring to the composition of the board, which could not be quickly changed, as sufficient guarantee against the possibility that this would not be minimalist but would grow by the establishment of new committees. He said specifically that the last thing the Government would wish to see would be large new committees arising. I believe that this provides some guarantee that, should there be any danger of it, the Government will endeavour to find ways to reverse that trend, which would not be in keeping with the contents of the Bill or the intentions behind it.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 65, line 21, at end insert ("or who has infringed the rights of other registered persons in respect of belonging to a trade union.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: Part III of the Bill gives important status to the RIBA. It introduces a legal framework of proper procedures to deal with alleged misconduct and incompetence against architects. I understand that the RIBA fully supports this part of the Bill. Therefore, it is extraordinary that the RIBA has ceased to recognise the trade union that represents the vast majority of its staff; that is, the MSF Union. It has reached this decision despite the fact that 85 per cent. of RIBA employees are members of the union and 92 per cent. of all staff voted for the re-establishment of trade union rights in an independently scrutinised ballot.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para6"></a>I am well aware that the Government are probably not enthusiastic about trade unions. However, we are talking about the rights of individual staff members, the overwhelming majority of whom wish to be members of that trade union and wish it to be recognised by the employer. I fail to see how the RIBA can adopt the attitude that it has. The amendment is intended to give support to the views of the staff who wish their union to be recognised. I very much hope that the Government will be sympathetic to the spirit of the amendment. It seems to me to be extraordinary that in this day and age, when the overwhelming majority of the staff of a <P>


<a name="column_48"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>particular organisation wish to have their union recognised, the employer has no interest and moves the other way. I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to the thrust of this amendment. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   It grieves me that I rise to support the amendment. I have a great deal of respect for the architectural profession as a whole and many individual members of it whom I know. I respect also the way in which they operate, not just in the sense of professional and technical competence but in the way they treat others, whether they be clients, staff or other professionals. I believe it to be a blot on the escutcheon of the architectural profession that the dispute between the leadership and employees of the Royal Institute of British Architects has arisen. I hope that in supporting the amendment the Government will send out a very clear message to the profession that, while this part of the Bill is about the professional competence of the profession, there is also an expectation on the part of society that professional people should behave in a responsible manner to others with whom they come in contact, particularly those they employ.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para7"></a>I suspect that the action of the leadership of the RIBA has been disturbing to a large number of practising architects. They feel that their profession is brought into disrepute by this action. It is to be hoped, even at this late stage, action can be taken, in the form of an amendment, to make amends for this blot on the escutcheon of the architectural profession, all members of which are listening to this debate, according to the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   This amendment has nothing to do with the Bill. The Bill is not about the RIBA but about an entirely different body: the Architects' Registration Council. The Bill affects registered architects, not unregistered employees of the RIBA. The right to belong to a trade union and protection against infringement of that right is properly dealt with across all industries and professions by employment legislation. This Bill contains provisions that deal with allegations of unacceptable professional conduct. If it were alleged that the type of infringement under discussion constituted unacceptable professional conduct, it should be dealt with in a proper manner as set out in the Bill. But this Bill does not even require architects to be very good architects; it certainly does not require them to be very good employers or people. That is entirely outside the scope of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para8"></a>It would be wrong and contrary to the principles of natural justice for a person against whom an allegation had been made simply to be thrown out by the registrar without his case being heard and dealt with in a proper way. The registrar would be entirely the wrong person to hear a case of this kind. I very much hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment without further ado.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   Perhaps I may point out to the Minister that the amendment is entirely within the context of the thrust of this part of the Bill, because it talks about registered architects. The amendment is <P>


<a name="column_49"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>drawn fairly narrowly in that it applies only to registered architects who are denied their trade union rights. With that explanation, the Minister might like to reconsider his remarks, because, as I said, the problems are faced by registered architects, and that is what this part of the Bill is about.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para9"></a>The amendment does not refer to other members of the RIBA's staff who are not registered architects. If the RIBA were to be required to confer what everyone, I think, would consider to be the right of trade union membership and representation to registered members who are members of staff, those same rights would be read across to other members of staff who were not necessarily registered architects.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Neither does the Bill deal with registered architects who have difficulty obtaining their child benefit. Registered architects, along with everyone else, have the rights granted by employment legislation. That is the right place for those rights. They have no place in the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   Of course, in a narrow technical sense the Minister is right, but I draw a great deal of comfort from two phrases that he used. He used the phrases, "very good employers" and "very good people". I think by that he meant that he welcomes employers who are good employers and behave decently to their employees. There was indication of a slight rap over the knuckles of people who are not good employers. I welcome that rap over the knuckles. In that spirit, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para10"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-13_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank </B>   moved Amendment No. 201:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 66, line 12, at end insert ("and shall consult the chartered bodies of architects in the United Kingdom and shall have special regard to the advice received from such bodies.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: In commenting upon Amendment No. 200A, the Minister rightly said that the Bill is not about the RIBA. It is important to emphasise that we are looking at chartered bodies--bodies of chartered architects--who represent about 70 per cent. of the profession, which are properly concerned with the interests of the profession. That is a wide responsibility, although I see it also as a public duty. The new registration body, despite what the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, said earlier, has been designed to, and, I hope, will function in the public interest, as the Bill sets out.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para12"></a>What we need for the success of the registration body and for the prosperity of the profession is co-operation between the professional bodies and the registration body to ensure that both, in their way, contribute to the public interest and to a flourishing, successful, and well-focused profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para13"></a>The amendment has a simple purpose. It is to ensure that the professional bodies are properly consulted about the development of architectural education and entry into the profession. Perhaps I may refer first to entry into the profession. Again, I readily concede that in 1931 it may have been in the minds--I can say no more <P>


<a name="column_50"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 50</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>than that--of a number of architects that a new registration body would in some way help to restrict or confine entry into the profession. I do not anticipate that that is what they would want today or that it is what the new registration body will do. However, it is important that the only people admitted to the profession are those who have proper and widely understood qualifications and who have been through the proper courses to justify their entitlement to the name "registered architect". I believe that that is a view which will be common to all Members of the Committee and one we must accept.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para14"></a>Secondly--this, I believe, follows--if we are to have entry into the profession by those best qualified to be called registered architects, it is important to pay attention to the development of architectural education. Architectural education has, traditionally and very properly, been the responsibility of the professional bodies. It is the professional bodies for architects in this case, but equally the education of professionals, whether in medicine, law, or engineering, has traditionally been, and remains, the concern of those various professional bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para15"></a>In recent years there has been some rivalry--if I may put it that way--between the existing Board of Architectural Education and the professional bodies. I say that despite some genuine and devoted service by distinguished architects in the board's service. I think, for example, of the present chairman of the board, Professor Ken Murta. The board disappears under this legislation. There is total agreement over that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-13_para16"></a>What I seek to ensure is a partnership between the new body and the professional organisations over education and entry into the profession, because the ownership of education is, as I say, a proper concern for all professional bodies, and the new organisation would make no claim to that. It could only by stealth or inadvertence find itself involved in questions of education. I hope that the Minister will say that that is his understanding of the matter. Even if he were to suggest that the amendment is unnecessary, I hope that he will make it clear that consultation with the professional bodies will be at the heart of the new registration body both in determining those who are fit and proper persons to join the profession and what education they should have in order to do so. I beg to move.

I appreciate that my noble friend may not be able to answer off the cuff, but I should be happy if he would write to me. I remember on the question of registration and education in the years when I was a junior Minister having to go to Brussels to discuss common qualifications with other members of the Community, in particular the Germans. I wonder whether registration here will automatically mean registration throughout the EU; and, equally, whether we would be prepared to accept EU architects, however they may have been educated, under the proposals.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 51</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para0"></a>I turn to the amendment. One of the duties of the new board will be to consult such professional bodies as it considers appropriate before adopting any qualifications, practical experience, and examination requirements for registration. I can fully understand the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, to make it absolutely certain that the chartered architectural bodies will be among the consultees. Their advice on the criteria for registration will be of particular importance to the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para1"></a>Let me therefore assure the Committee that in carrying out that function the board will have to act reasonably in deciding which bodies to consult and in having regard to any advice received. It would clearly be unreasonable for the board to fail to include chartered architectural bodies in its consultations, or not to consider their representations. For that reason, I see no need for a specific reference to that group of consultees on the face of the Bill. I hope that I have reassured the noble Lord and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   I hesitate to intervene between the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Finsberg, but the answer to the noble Lord's question is that there are acceptable reciprocal arrangements between the member states of the European Union under the architects' directive. The point is most important and it is one to which the new registration body must give continuing attention.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para2"></a>I am grateful for what the Minister said. In particular, I am comforted by his comment about the board having to act reasonably. To say that the profession should be among the consultees might seem to diminish its relative role. I am sure that was not his intention, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(b) where the application is made on the ground that he satisfies subsection (1)(b), within six").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 202, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 204 to 208 and 214 to 217.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para5"></a>Clause 116 sets out the functions of the registrar of architects and requires him to notify applicants for registration of a decision within three months. That will allow sufficient time for routine applications. However, a small minority of applications, mainly from overseas, require the board to exercise its judgment about the standard of competence attained and may require the applicant to pass an examination. That will need more time. Amendment No. 202 therefore will allow six months instead of three for the registrar to notify applicants in such cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para6"></a>Clause 117 requires the professional conduct committee to make a disciplinary order against a person whom it has been found guilty of unacceptable <P>


<a name="column_52"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 52</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>professional conduct or professional incompetence. This order may involve erasure from the register, suspension, a fine or simply a reprimand. Amendment No. 204 would replace this requirement with a discretion and would give the committee freedom not to impose any form of disciplinary order if it considered the matter too trivial to merit any punishment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para7"></a>Amendment No. 205 is consequential to this change (to Amendment No. 204). Instead of publishing the names of people against whom a disciplinary order has been made, the professional conduct committee would be required to publish a list of those whom it has found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct or professional incompetence and give a description of the nature of the conduct or offence concerned.

<A NAME = "60401-14_para8"></a>Amendment No. 214A corrects a minor drafting error. If an appeal against a disciplinary order or against the removal of a person's name from the register is going to be made to the High Court or the Court of Session, the clock will start running from the date the notice of decision is served, instead of the date of the disciplinary action concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para9"></a>Amendment No. 208 corrects a drafting error in Clause 117. As drafted, one of the possible penalties for failure to pay a fine imposed on a person found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct or professional incompetence would be a further fine. This was not intended. Instead, the amendment will make the penalty for non payment of a fine, either suspension or erasure from the register.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para10"></a>The other amendments in this group, (Nos. 206, 207, 214, 215, 216, 217) are necessary consequential amendments. I trust that this group of amendments will meet with the Committee's approval. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   Perhaps I may refer to a comment which the Minister made about Amendment No. 204. He suggested that the amendment would give the professional conduct committee the discretion not to impose a penalty against someone whom it had found guilty of professional misconduct or incompetence. He suggested that the reason for not imposing a penalty was that the transgression might be considered too trivial.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para11"></a>I am not sure that the Minister meant to make that suggestion and perhaps I may suggest another scenario. The misconduct or incompetence may be of a serious nature but the standing of the architect and the fact that he has been found guilty will be enough of a penalty in itself. That will give the professional conduct committee the ability to declare the fact that they have found someone guilty, even though for a significant offence, yet impose no penalty. Does the Minister confirm that that is an acceptable understanding of the amendment?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I hesitate to leap onto that possibly shaky ground. I shall consider what the noble Lord said and shall write to him if, after consideration, I in any way disagree with what he said.

<A NAME="60401-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank </B>   moved Amendment No. 203:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 67, line 43, at beginning insert ("serious or repeated").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: I hesitated in tabling the amendment, which is self explanatory, because I strongly believe in the need to maintain a high level of competence in the profession. Although the profession might not like my comment I must say that it, like every other profession, has its bottom 10 per cent. which it could do without. I have no wish to protect them and it would not be proper to do so given my previous comment that the overriding purpose of the legislation is to protect the public and not the profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para16"></a>Nor would I agree that the amendment includes the provision "serious and repeated". I am substituting "or" for "and", which is an important factor. Either the shortcomings should be serious or they should be repeated. It would not be sufficient that the two factors should be taken together. I hope that I have made that clear, although I am not sure that I have.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para17"></a>We all make mistakes in our professional life and elsewhere and there is no point in pursuing a minor or one-off error of the kind that everyone makes from time to time. I am aware that there is always a danger of certain vexatious complaints resulting in a great deal more work than the new board can undertake. I hope that the Minister will see the intention of my proposal and will respond in the spirit of it. I hope that he will strongly support the need for the new board to do all within its power within the terms of the Bill to ensure that the profession serves the public in the best possible way.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   The noble Lord explained himself very well and I have a clear understanding of the difference between "serious or repeated" and "serious and repeated". An error which is not serious but has been repeated is perhaps the noble Lord's continuing demotion of my noble friend Lord Caithness!
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para18"></a>The Government are opposed to Amendment No. 203 on the simple ground that it is unnecessary. There are already two opportunities to decide whether an allegation of professional incompetence is taken further. First, persons appointed by the board, or the professional conduct committee itself, must satisfy themselves that there is a case to answer. Secondly, the professional conduct committee has discretion to satisfy itself whether professional incompetence has taken place. In both cases it will be possible to decide that the matter is sufficiently trivial or isolated not to be regarded as professional incompetence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para19"></a>The addition of the words "serious or repeated" would do little to clarify matters. After all, their interpretation is a matter of opinion and it would be for the same committee to decide. In any event, I expect that the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, will be doubly reassured by the Government's Amendment No. 204, which removes the requirement for the committee to make any disciplinary order if it considers none to be necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-14_para20"></a>I hope that my remarks have convinced the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="60401-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   Before the noble Lord withdraws the amendment, as I am sure he will, I ask my noble friend to notice that as presently drafted, Clause 117 requires that the case "shall" be investigated where there is an allegation of either of the two kinds of offences mentioned. Therefore, the discretion to which he referred is not apparent on the face of the Bill. If the Bill said that the case "may" be investigated, what my noble friend said would be plain to all who read the legislation. I hope that my noble friend will seek further clarification about that before the next stage because it would be a great pity if this machine, which is intended to be smooth, simple and cheap to run, were required accidentally to investigate every scintilla of doubt in relation to professional propriety. For once, I find myself in modest agreement with the noble Lord opposite.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   I pause to see whether the Minister wishes to respond to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, because the element of discretion is extremely important. I had understood that there was discretion, but I may have misread the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will clarify this matter because it is very important. Indeed, if it is not clarified to my satisfaction, I would certainly consider raising this matter again at a later stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para0"></a>I am surprised that the noble Earl--and I beg his pardon--Lord Caithness had not thought of intervening on the amendment, because I should have thought that he might wish to express strong opposition to it. In view of what he said earlier about architects, I thought that he might consider that on every possible occasion, for whatever error had been committed, architects should be subject to the provisions of the Bill and to disciplinary action. But perhaps on reflection, the noble Earl feels that his earlier language was rather strong and therefore is prepared to go along with the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para1"></a>Although in the circumstances I must withdraw the amendment at this stage, if there is no discretion I may return to the matter on Report. It may well be that in the interval between now and Report, the Minister will write to me to point out what both the noble Lord, Lord Elton, and I have missed or, alternatively, I may discover for myself that the element of discretion exists satisfactorily.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   Perhaps I may intervene to ask the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, what discretion he suggests should be written in. It would concern me greatly if all allegations were not investigated. The Bill is silent as to the extent of those investigations. I would hope that even where an accusation has been made that appears vexatious, some degree of investigation, even though it may be fairly minimal, takes place and that no accusation or allegation is dismissed as trivial or insubstantial.
<P>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 55</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para2"></a>As I said, the Bill as I read it does not give any explanation as to how much investigation would take place. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, will accept that we must ensure that all allegations are investigated, even though it may not be in great depth.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   I agree with that. It is an extremely important point because there must be no presumption of any matter being vexatious. It must be investigated to see whether or not it is. However, I have tabled this amendment in these precise terms to ensure that anything which is not serious or repeated should not have the results which are set out in Clause 117. But I can see from the movement of the Minister that he has extremely important matters to divulge to the Committee.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I really wish to stand by what I said in my initial answer. Clearly, reading Clause 117, if it appears to the registrar that a person may be guilty of unacceptable professional conduct or incompetence or if an allegation is made to that effect, then the matter will be investigated. There is no discretion there.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para3"></a>The discretion comes in at the next stage when the persons investigating the case must find that a registered person has a case to answer. That is the first filter. Unsubstantiated allegations will drop out at that stage. The professional conduct committee must then satisfy itself that what is alleged has actually occurred. I presume that some allegations will drop out at that stage too. The professional conduct committee may then find that what has occurred is of such little import that it makes no award against the architect concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para4"></a>Those are the three levels of discretion which exist in the Bill as amended once my amendments are accepted. I believe that that is the right arrangement and that people can be sure that their allegations will be investigated. However, there are adequate filters to make sure that unsubstantiated allegations do not take up a lot of time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: Members of the Committee may think that this matter is rather separate from the revision of the Architects Registration Acts, which is the important part of Part III. But I think it is wholly appropriate that I should briefly raise this question because it involves an extremely important measure of consumer protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para12"></a>By defining what an architect is and which form of words so describes a registered architect, the amendment seeks to prevent those who might believe that there is some advantage in being thought to be an architect sailing under false colours, adopting misleading identities and in effect disguising themselves as architects.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para13"></a>I know that over a long period of time, the existing registration body has had a great deal to do in trying to ensure that clients and the public are under no misunderstanding as to who is and is not entitled to call himself an architect. There was very limited provision--and I refer to naval architects in the original legislation of 1931.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para14"></a>If any Members of the Committee look at the yellow pages of a telephone directory or in a local newspaper, they will see that many individuals purport to sail under that title. Some of them use a spelling like a-r-k-i-t-e-c-t because that spells out phonetically the word "architect". Some refer to themselves as providing architects' design services and some refer to a complete architectural service. It is reasonable for lay people to assume that those people are qualified and registered architects. They may then be misled into employing individuals who are not qualified to do the job for which they have been sought.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para15"></a>Again, I look at the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, when I say that I wish to make it absolutely clear that there is no intention here at all to exclude from the performance of their proper skills members of other professions. However, I am sure that the noble Earl would not like any individual to masquerade with the title of "surveyor" if he were not qualified to do so. All I am <P>


<a name="column_57"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 57</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggesting is that this Chamber should contribute towards making it more difficult for those who are not architects, who are not qualified and who have not been entered within the profession to claim that they are so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para16"></a>I hope that the Minister will not suggest that the problem is common to all professions. Whether or not it is remains to be seen. If the Minister claims that it is, I should like to have illustrations, for example, from the profession of medicine which do not cause problems that ought to be remedied. But if indeed it is common to other professions, that, of itself, is hardly a case for failing to remedy the abuse of the position of architect under the provisions of the Bill. Why should we fail to do what ought to be done simply because the opportunity is not before us to do likewise for other professions?
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para17"></a>The alternative argument is that we should educate the public. Well, we have had 65 years of seeking to educate the public about who is or is not a registered architect. Within the provisions now before the Committee, it may be possible for the new registration body to run a campaign to help the public understand who is and who is not an architect. But, as I said, there has been limited success in that respect. The existing registration body has spent a good deal of time seeking to protect the public from those who have masqueraded as architects in one way or another.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-15_para18"></a>I am sure that the Minister will deplore misrepresentation in so far as some people claim to be architects when they are not so qualified. However, if the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment today because it is not, perhaps, ideally drafted, it would be most reassuring if he would undertake to consider a similar amendment at a later stage. Whatever the outcome of today's discussion, that is something I should like to consider in the light of the Minister's response. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60401-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Rogers of Quarry Bank, is seeking to do, but I have some fears that his amendment would go much further than his stated intention. I am not clear whether the terminology is as precise as he suggested. The noble Lord used words like "misrepresentation" and "masquerade" to describe people who are in professions other than architecture but who provide professional services which have some relationship to what the general public would consider to be building work, architecture and so on. I am worried lest the effect of the amendment would prove to be far more restrictive than would be acceptable, given the fact that other professions are also allowed to undertake some of the work in the building area.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-16_para0"></a>I am not clear what the expression "use of similar words" actually means in the amendment. If it means that no person should pretend to be an architect when he is not, then that is beyond challenge. However, if the noble Lord is seeking to prevent other professions providing certain services to the public--for example, design services, building conservation and so on--I am concerned lest the effect of the amendment would prove to be duly restrictive and too protective of the architectural profession at the expense of others.

<A NAME="60401-16_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I have a few points to make to the noble Lord, Lord Rogers. When I spoke earlier I was trying to make clear that some of the architects with whom I dealt in the past--and, indeed, with whom I still deal--who are not masquerading as architects and are fully qualified have not provided the service that would entitle them to be set up on a pedestal. However, my real point is that I believe that the registering of title is a totally outdated and outmoded form for any organisation to undertake. That applies particularly to one part of this wide profession--the architects--who seek to maintain it. That is the bane of what I was trying to say.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-16_para1"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, I shall continue to use architects because some of them are extremely good. However, it is only right that I should point out that I have had many bad experiences as indeed have other people. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. I find the amendment to be very ambiguous. I was reassured to some extent by what the noble Lord, Lord Rogers, said. If someone tries to pose as an architect who is not so qualified, I believe that such a provision would be fair. But many people provide services which are very similar to those provided by architects and we should allow such services to continue; for example, chartered building surveyors provide a host of services.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-16_para2"></a>Part of my training was spent in designing and adapting buildings. If now, in my profession as an estate agent, I wish to draw plans of a house for sale and show the plans on the particulars for sale, would the noble Lord, Lord Rogers, allow me to do so? I spent six years trying to get qualified and eventually did so. Surely I can use that part of my professional training. That is the point which concerns the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and myself; namely, that the amendment would actually prove to be a great deal wider than the noble Lord realises.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I apologise for joining the debate rather late. The protection of title is a most important matter. I say that because there has been a tradition of disquiet between the architectural profession so eloquently represented by the noble Lord, Lord Rogers, and the civil engineering profession so ineloquently misrepresented here by myself. We have always been at daggers drawn in various ways; but that does not apply to me personally. Indeed, I have the greatest admiration for architects and have said so on many occasions. As a structural engineer, I have assisted them in ensuring that their buildings stay up, which is always a good idea. Moreover, I have designed buildings--and very nasty they were. They were nasties because I am an engineer and not an architect. Had I been an architect, they would have been absolutely splendid.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-16_para3"></a>The protection of title is important in the sense that when you buy an architect, so to speak, you buy an architect and not some kind of building technician who fancies himself to be an architect. If Members of the Committee take a profession where the title is not protected, they will see what I mean; for example, the title of "engineer" is not protected. People describe <P>


<a name="column_59"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 59</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>themselves and are described as engineers when in fact they are no more engineers than the noble Earl. But the noble Earl would never dream of doing such a thing because he is not an imposter; nor, indeed, are those people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-16_para4"></a>They are engineering technicians; for example, a television engineer is a mechanic. Then there are motor engineers. I know that my noble friend Lord Monkswell is an excellent engineer, although he gets a little above himself from time to time. The title of chartered engineer, the professional engineer of whom I speak, is not protected. I should like to see a Bill which would protect their title in the same way as the title of architect is protected. It is not a matter of closed shops or anything of that nature; it is a matter of presenting a professional expertise truly, openly, honestly and in a way which can be understood by reference to the register or to the Royal Institute of British Architects. I believe that the registration of title as regards architects is entirely to be supported. Indeed, it should be extended far beyond architects so as to cover others in the building arena, including the noble Earl opposite who is shaking his head for some reason. I should also like to protect him because he is obviously in need of protection.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-16_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   Will the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, bear in mind that almost a logical consequence of protecting title is then to protect jobs? The European architects' directive has made working in Europe for many chartered building surveyors absolutely impossible. It has reduced their opportunity of carrying out work which they currently do as they are banned from so doing because of the registration of title.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   They are trying to do work which others could more properly and better do.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   Like my noble friend Lord Caithness I should declare an interest because I, too, am a surveyor. I quite understand what the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, is trying to do. He is trying to ensure that no one without appropriate qualifications can hold himself up to be professionally qualified as an architect. However, I suspect that his proposal could do serious damage to a number of surveyors who perform architectural services in that they are capable of, and do, design buildings and extensions, and supervise repairs and maintenance. I do not wish to be rude to architects because it is not my opinion but the chartered surveyor who trained me always said that the task of a chartered surveyor was to correct the mistakes made by architects. The noble Lord should find a different way of trying to achieve the purpose he rightly has in mind.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   As I have been alluded to in this debate, I rise to declare that I am an engineer. However, that term can encompass anything from a fitter at one end to a chartered engineer with tremendous professional competence at the other. I agree with my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon that there is a problem in this respect in this country. I suggest that it extends far wider and is of far greater import than <P>


<a name="column_60"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Members of the Committee who have spoken today have mentioned. I give a couple of examples. Anyone, without any capability or qualification whatever, can set himself up as a plumber, an electrician or a roofing contractor. The problems that the general public experience as a result are horrendous.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-16_para5"></a>In America--the "home of the free"--my brother works as a landscape contractor. If someone wants to set himself up as a landscape contractor in this country he need have absolutely no qualifications or professional competence whatever. He can hawk his services where he likes. In the state of California, however, a person wishing to practise as a landscape contractor not only has to receive some training and pass exams; he also has to be licensed by the local authority and must have professional indemnity insurance. If those sorts of restrictions can operate in what is described as the free capitalist economy of the United States, surely we can go some way towards emulating it. I would hope that the protection of architects embodied within the Bill was a step that we could, and should, willingly take. Notwithstanding that other areas of economic activity within our society are not so regulated, we should set out our stall to ensure the regulation of the architectural profession and then ensure the regulation of every other profession that bears on the lives of ordinary consumers.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   We seem to have strayed rather wide in recent contributions. Heaven knows where the process might end if we allow it to carry on. We may be discussing qualifications for legislators even!
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-16_para6"></a>It is of fundamental importance, in matters concerning registration, that the general public should be given as precise and clear a definition as possible over who is registered and who is not. The Architects (Registration) Act 1938 achieves this by requiring that any person using the title "architect" in the course of his business has to be registered. There are specific exemptions for naval, landscape and golf course architects who are unlikely to be confused with the real thing. This is simple and easy to understand and does not allow any room for confusion or misinterpretation. It is the definition which the Government wish to retain.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-16_para7"></a>There will always be unqualified persons who would like to pass themselves off as architects by using similar titles or designations. I have sympathy with the intent of the amendment to prevent such persons misleading the public. However, by expanding the scope of the protection to include similar words to "architect" the amendment would introduce a grey area over exactly what title is being protected. Someone who misspells the word "architect" is hardly likely to be mistaken for the sort of architect anyone would want to employ.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-16_para8"></a>There are perfectly legitimate designations currently used by non-architects such as "architectural consultants", "architectural designers" and so on, which would be affected by the amendment. It is not in the interests of the public to weaken the distinction between these sorts of designation and the title "architect". Nor would it be fair to prevent persons using designations which accurately describe the work which they legitimately carry out, as was pointed out by my noble friend Lord Caithness.

<A NAME = "60401-16_para9"></a>For these reasons, expansion of protection of title was never a part of the package of reforms which the Government, the RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects) and ARCUK (Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom) agreed upon. Nor was it the subject of the consultation which the Government subsequently carried out. It would be unreasonable to introduce any change in the scope of protection of title without fully consulting all those who might be affected. I do not believe that such an exercise would ultimately serve the interests of either the architectural profession or the general public.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-16_para10"></a>It may interest the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, to know that the title "surveyor" is a wide one. There is a Bill before this Chamber at the moment--the Party Wall Bill--where the term "surveyor" is specifically defined to include almost anyone who is competent to do the job that is required by that Bill and might even extend to cover architects if they wish to call themselves that. Therefore I do not believe the noble Lord can levy that charge against my noble friend.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60401-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   Has that Bill come before this Chamber?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Yes, indeed, I replied to its Second Reading.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   Is the Committee stage yet to come? Will we then discuss the matter to which the noble Lord has just referred?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I look forward to it. I was merely pointing out that there was no protection as regards the title of "surveyor". Indeed, the surveyors themselves who are promoting that Bill do not seem to have the worries that the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, said they would. I hope that I have persuaded the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, that any expansion of protection of title would be a complex matter and that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   The Minister is, of course, right in saying that the matter of this amendment was not subject to any discussion between the profession and his department. I clearly said in my opening remarks that this might not seem to be wholly appropriate to the Architects (Registration) Act but that this was a suitable opportunity of the kind noble Lords seek to take to introduce desirable change on the basis of legislation before the Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para0"></a>I am sorry that there should be any misunderstanding about the amendment. With great respect to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, I want to make it absolutely clear that, having seen the professions working together in the construction industry over a considerable period of time, it is only by working as a team that we can expect to achieve the quality of building which I know--despite his unfortunate experience--he and I would both like to see. Architects are very much dependent upon chartered surveyors. They work closely with structural engineers, building service engineers and civil engineers, and with many other professions. Nothing that I say today should <P>


<a name="column_62"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be thought to cast doubt upon that or to imply that I should like architects--of which I am not one--to take work away from those in other professions whom they are dependent upon and who do excellent work within this industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para1"></a>The noble Earl referred to the amendments being ambiguous. Clearly I puzzled the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, who said he thought that the amendment went too far. He believed the implication was that it prevented others from offering professional services. However, at present a man and woman with no qualifications in any profession can choose to use a form of description which could mislead the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para2"></a>The Minister believed that potential clients or clients would not be easily misled by the form of language to which I referred earlier. I hope the Minister will remember that many clients are small, once in a lifetime clients. They wish to extend their house; or perhaps a widow wishes to spend some money left to her on the death of her husband. Those men and women have no experience of the profession. They assume that there are regulations which prevent anyone who is not an architect purporting to be one. The purpose of my amendment is solely to protect such persons from the possibility of misrepresentation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para3"></a>I recognise what the Minister says about a grey area. He seemed to be more passionate for consultation than Ministers usually are. I do not believe that it is a complex matter. The provision could be changed on the face of the Bill now if the Minister so wished and the Committee so decided. However, in view of the misunderstandings which appear to be common to both sides of the Chamber, I do not press the amendment. I shall consider fully what has been said, including the support received from the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon. I shall consider whether it will be proper to come back to the matter at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 87, line 4, leave out from ("represent") to end of line 5 and insert ("consumer and public interests, none of whom should be from other trades or professions seen to be competitive with architects").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: This is perhaps the most important of the amendments that I have put before the Committee today. The Minister may agree that the success or failure of the new body is dependent upon its structure, in particular the existence of the board. There has been a major step forward--I hope that Members on both sides of the Chamber will fully understand it--in the provision in the Bill for the governing body of registration in this country. The old council of ARCUK <P>


<a name="column_63"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consisted of 77 members while the proposed new body consists of only 15. More importantly--it is the kernel of my amendment--of the 77 members of the old council, only seven were non-architects while a majority of the small new board will be independents. Under the provisions of the statutes, the great majority of ARCUK were members of the RIBA. There is no guarantee that the existing professional bodies will be represented in the elections of members of the new board, despite the fact that the RIBA represents 70 per cent. of the profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para10"></a>It is important--it is why I wholly support the provisions of the Bill--that if this new body is to be genuinely representative of the public, and within the intention of the Government the profession should not have a majority on the board. On the other hand, if this legislation is to be a success and to last as long as the previous legislation, the new body must have the full confidence of the profession. There is real concern within the profession about the proportion--a minority--of elected members to be appointed to the board, with no special provision for the representation of the professional bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para11"></a>I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, considered whether it might be desirable to reverse the proportions. He decided not to proceed, I think rightly. But his thoughts fairly reflected the representations that many architects might make: that it is a step too far to reverse the proportions on what is a small board. To that extent the provision is a revolutionary change; and it is not surprising that architects have anxieties about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para12"></a>Their anxiety is compounded by the fear that the Bill as drafted will admit as independents (if I may use that word to describe those who are nominated effectively by the Government) men and women from professions competing with architects in the construction process, or those seeking to qualify for registration as architects when hitherto they have not done so. I hope the Minister will say that it is not the Government's intention to provide among those independents for professions which compete with the architects' profession any more than that would be appropriate if any of the other professions in the construction industry had such a registration Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para13"></a>It is easy for many of us to assume that the profession is dominated by a number of large, well known firms or by very distinguished architects who are almost household names. That is not the case. It is a profession of small practices which on the whole have small clients. Those small clients are very diverse. Perhaps I may give three examples. There is the sole practitioner who had 32 projects in the past year, 25 of which were for domestic extensions, the largest an extension to a church. Then there is the medium-sized practice with 16 jobs on its books, almost all of which are in the public sector. Roughly 40 per cent. of those jobs are for individuals, or for first time clients. Then there is the large practice with 60 staff and 100 live projects, largely in education, the arts and leisure. It is a grave mistake <P>


<a name="column_64"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to assume at present that the majority of architects work for large clients and in property development. That is simply not the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para14"></a>Those facts are not necessarily familiar even to Ministers. I believe that full account should be taken of those facts when deciding who the members of the board will be. The public sector remains important. That is in part central government, local government, hospital trusts, trusts in the field of education and in universities and their extensions. There has been a large building programme in that area. That large public sector should be represented in the appropriate way on the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para15"></a>I refer to housing associations. Although increasingly obliged for financial reasons to design and build, they now provide the great bulk of public sector housing. It is an important group of institutions which might be represented, if not formally, by individuals serving on the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para16"></a>There is the large number of quite small, once in a lifetime, domestic clients. The Government will have to consider how best they should be represented. It might be by someone involved in the consumer movement--either the National Consumer Council or the Consumers' Association. It could be someone working closely with the Citizens Advice Bureaux which are called upon from time to time to advise potential clients on how they may go about finding an architect. It may be someone from a women's institute. It will be for the Government to decide. I merely ask the Minister today to recognise that they should consider those kinds of bodies to find people who will constitute the lay membership of the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-17_para17"></a>The legislation is not intended to protect Bovis, Wimpey or any of the major commercial property developers like Stewart Lipton, for example, a notable name and a company which has done excellent work. They all know where to find the right architect and how to obtain redress of a grievance, usually through the law, if a problem occurs. They can look after themselves and chop and change in their choice of architect. However, the ordinary man or woman, the once-in-a-lifetime client, is not in that position. I am sure that the Minister will be able to say that such people will be properly represented on the new board which will not be made up of people competing with the architects' profession. If he can say that, then I and the profession will be well content. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60401-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   In Schedule 2 to the Bill, under the heading "Appointed members", there is the phrase:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"represent the interests of users of architectural services and the general public". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I therefore assume that the Government have in mind a category of individuals who use architectural services. My understanding is that some users of architectural services are from the professions to which the noble Lord referred. It would be wrong if a large number of such professions were represented on the new board, but it seems to me that one or two would not come amiss, if it were thought proper in terms of their other contributions to the work.
<P>


<a name="column_65"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 65</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-18_para0"></a>I am concerned that a phrase as wide as "competitive with architects" should find its way into legislation. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, does not intend that, but the phrase is so wide that it is difficult to know who would be allowed to serve on the new body. I am worried that yet again the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, has gone further than I would have expected. I understand that he does not want a large number of persons from other professions to be appointed to the body and that is a proper concern. However, if one or two should appear on the body as users of architectural services, it might not be such a bad thing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-18_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I hope that my noble friend Lord Lucas will resist the amendment as another piece of protectionism by architects. As drafted, the Bill is right. The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, adduced a number of arguments for some good people who should be appointed to the board or who are worthy of consideration. Having listened carefully to him, I found no arguments why those who use the services of architects but who also compete with them--such as chartered building surveyors or chartered surveyors--should not be represented.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-18_para1"></a>On an earlier amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, said that the professions had worked in harmony and should continue to do so. Having said that, it seems odd that the noble Lord should wish to exclude from the board those people with whom architects will work in the future.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   There might be an answer to that proposition or a reason for it. Thirty years ago, when I was active in consulting engineering, I recall that such building professionals as chartered surveyors and the like--estimable people in almost every way--attempted to usurp the work of architects. They did so largely by insinuating themselves in as project managers. Being somewhat feeble, the architects permitted them to do that. When I returned to consulting engineering after a period in another place (from which I was ejected by popular appeal), I discovered that the quantity surveyors were attempting in the same way to insinuate themselves into consulting engineering. The consulting engineers were able to repel them, at least for a while. There is more to chartered surveyors than meets the eye, there is nothing wimpish about them. They are a serious competitive body of people who must be carefully watched. That is possibly why we do not want too many of them on this body.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-18_para2"></a>It all boils down to what one considers a profession, what it is for and how it ought to be disciplined and arranged. To some extent, the manner in which the profession is arranged and disciplined is a definition of the profession itself. I was excited that my noble friend Lord Williams put down an earlier amendment which proposed a majority of architects on the board. I was about to put down a similar amendment, but since he had done so I did not. Unfortunately, he withdrew his and left me stranded like a whale. No doubt I shall put it down again on Report, because it was right.
<P>


<a name="column_66"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-18_para3"></a>The essence of a profession is that it is disciplined, organised and arranged by its members. It is different from a business. I know that noble Lords opposite are obsessed with the idea of the market, with businesses and similar matters and can think of nothing else. I absolve them from even considering the matter. However, that is not the case with my noble friends. They should consider the professions and what they are like. I shall advise my noble friends on the Front Bench where to look for a description of the ethos of the profession which might help and guide them in their attitude to this part of the Bill. I revert to a point which I have mentioned before in this House, as the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, will remember. It is a well known book called: The Acquisitive Society, by R.H. Tawney, a well known socialist. That word has perhaps gone out of popular usage lately. In his book, R. H. Tawney included an interesting chapter in which he discusses the industrial society and describes the professions as the model he would like to see an industrial society take.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-18_para4"></a>My noble friends on the Front Bench will be happy to note that not only does R.H. Tawney say that, but he suggests that the pattern of professional institutions such as the RIBA--although he does not mention it by name--and other professional institutions which I have mentioned was the kind of pattern that the trade union movement should have taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-18_para5"></a>In parenthesis, if my party had listened to Tawney in those days and had converted the trade unions into the same shape as the professional institutions, the world would have been a much better place than it is today. If a profession is to remain a profession and not be transformed into something else, it must retain a substantial measure of self-government. The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, has gone a long way towards meeting the Government's views, much further than I like. If a profession is not self-governing, it ceases to be a profession. In so far as it ceases to be a profession, it loses its value to society.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, seems to envisage his committee overrun by mice or perhaps chartered surveyors. I assure him that it will not happen. Although his fears may be understandable, they are unfounded. The wording of the paragraph closely reflects the text of the department's position paper, which had the support of both the Architect's Registration Council of the United Kingdom and the Royal Institute of British Architects. The Government's aim remains the same: that the appointed members should represent a balance between consumers of architectural services and the general public. The Government will consider very carefully who those appointed members should be. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, that appointees should be independent men and women who wish to perform a public service and represent clients. I take his point too that there will be small, once in a lifetime clients who should be taken into account when the Government decide whom to appoint.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-18_para6"></a>But I cannot agree that the Government's hands should be tied and that no one from another profession within the construction industry, however eminent or <P>


<a name="column_67"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>independent minded, should be nominated. Other professionals from the construction industry might well be able to make a useful and constructive contribution to the board, as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said. To ban all such professionals from the board would almost be a requirement that none of the independent members on the board should have a clue as to what they are talking about. That would seem to be undesirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-18_para7"></a>Having said that, there is no question of such a person or persons dominating the board. It is a matter of simple arithmetic. There will be seven elected architects and the remaining eight appointed members will be divided between those who represent the general public and those who represent the consumers, both big and small, of architectural services. Any appointees from the construction industry would be in a small minority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-18_para8"></a>Finally, I should remind the Committee that there will be consultation before any members are appointed. I assure the Committee that any responses that we receive will be considered very carefully. I hope that, in that very short reply, I have given the comfort that the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, requires.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Before the noble Lord responds to that reply, may I ask with whom the Government are consulting? If one is talking about consumer interests and general interests, it is quite hard to know who the consultees should be.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I shall have to write to the noble Baroness on that matter.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, referred to protectionism. There is no protectionism whatever intended in this amendment. However, he will, I hope, accept that within his profession he would not like architects to determine what is a suitable education for a chartered surveyor or indeed to decide who is properly qualified to enter the profession. I seek only to establish in this amendment that there will be no representatives on the new board who will see their task precisely as that--speaking for other professions competitive with architects and seeking to determine, as they might easily do, the conditions for entry and the form that architectural education should take. In that sense the amendment is not protectionist at all. I simply ask for architects to have done to them what they would want to do, no more and no less, to others.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-18_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, made a fair point, which is not apparent from the amendment, when he said that he did not see why there should not be two or three representatives--I want to come back to that word--of other professions on the board. I should prefer to say that I totally accept--it may not have been clear from the amendment, which is why I must reconsider the form of words used--that some who may serve on the board not as architects but as the so-called independent members may have other professional qualifications.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   The noble Lord's remarks are the perfect preface to what I am about to say. I am very glad that I carry him with me. The other day I had the opportunity of hearing someone who had been for many years the property manager of a major university, during which time he placed many contracts with architects and other professions. I have no idea of his profession, though it is highly probable that he is a chartered surveyor. But not for one moment would I consider him an unsuitable person to be a member of the board. He would be there not as a chartered surveyor but as someone who has experience as a client, and he would be there in an individual capacity.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para0"></a>As so often, the noble Lord, Lord Howie, was outspoken where I was conciliatory; passionate where I was emollient; and quoted R.H. Tawney where, as always, I seek to represent the moderate centre in such matters. But what he said about self-governing professions is very important indeed. It would apply not only to architects but to others as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para1"></a>In his closing remarks, the Minister made a very important and reassuring remark. He said that appointees should be independent and not representative. That is the heart of the matter. When men and women from other professions sit on the board, even if in one or two instances those professions may be competitive, if they are truly independent and do not seek to represent their professions, I do not feel that there could be any complaint.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para2"></a>I shall reflect further on what the noble Lord said and on the discussion that we have had. In the light of that, I shall withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="60401-19_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Long: </B>   My Lords, I suggest that the Committee stage begin again not before eight o'clock.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, I thought that the statement by the Government Chief Whip would be responded to by Her Majesty's Opposition. There is a very important point to make about the statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para13"></a>I speak on behalf of these Benches in so far as this is a matter that I anticipate will be dealt with by Home Office Ministers. We are disturbed about bringing forward this legislation in the closing days of this parliamentary period. When the Bill comes before the House, we shall want to explore the point at which the Government found it necessary to bring it forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para14"></a>The Government will recall that when the original legislation on terrorism was brought before the House 20 years ago, it was immediately after the Birmingham bombings. Your Lordships' House very readily agreed with the other place, in view of the acute urgency of the matter and the new situation that had just arisen, that it was right to take that Bill through all its stages in a single day. I am not aware, unless we can be presented with evidence for it, that there has been any event (I am glad to say) within recent days which would appear to justify passing a Bill through this House with great haste in the closing stages before the Recess.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para15"></a>As I understand it, the Bill inescapably involves some restrictions on the individual. And your Lordships' House and Parliament generally have been cautious about agreeing such matters without careful discussion. Indeed, in 1975, when the original legislation on the <P>


<a name="column_70"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 70</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prevention of terrorism was before the House, there was a substantial debate. Remarks were made on both sides of the House about the need to ensure that the liberties of the citizen were looked after properly and that the Bill did not become part of the statute book permanently.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para16"></a>That is a view which we expressed in this House when we debated the renewal order only a month or so ago. I do not understand why, when we had that debate, no hint was given to your Lordships' House that new legislation of this kind was being brought forward. If it was not urgent one month ago or there was no justification for setting the Bill before the House then, why do we have to have it in the closing days before the Easter Recess? It will be difficult for a number of noble Lords to be present and to give the Bill the treatment it deserves.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para17"></a>I say that without prejudice to the contents of the Bill, the necessity for it or the debate which we shall have on it. However, I should like an explanation because noble Lords have been taken by surprise by the announcement just made. We should like to know why we should consider the Bill on Wednesday and why it cannot be postponed until the House returns. That will depend on whether the House is told of a new emergency which we had not anticipated and of which we are not aware which justifies bringing the legislation forward.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, the reason neither I nor a colleague rose to speak when the Government Chief Whip made the announcement was that I had been advised that my colleagues in another place, who are fully apprised of the importance of the issue, were satisfied that this business merited the exceptional course upon which the Commons decided.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, is correct in saying that it is a surprise. I await, as he does, with a great deal of interest the cause for the urgency and the issues themselves. That is understandable. But it is within my memory in this House in the past 10 or 12 years that on perhaps two or three occasions the House agreed, in the specific atmosphere and on the specific subject of terrorism, to take new legislation. We are therefore conscious of the fact that if the Government feel it necessary and if my colleagues in another place had not been consulted far more fully than we have been as yet--I make no complaint about that--and are satisfied in relation to the need for the legislation, then we are in the hands of the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para19"></a>If the Government wish to deal with the matter in all stages in the other place tomorrow and if the House has already determined to rise on Wednesday, then the two options are quite clear. First, we could do as the Government suggest and deal with all stages on Wednesday; or, secondly, we could find some other day. The other day may be Thursday, Friday, or it may be that we have to wait until after the Recess. I imagine that all those matters were considered by my colleagues.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para20"></a>We on these Benches recognise that it must be important for the Government to propose what they have. We trust that they are conscious of the niceties of procedure in both Houses and especially in this House. <P>


<a name="column_71"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Therefore, though I share the interest of the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, and pose the same questions, we shall not attempt to interfere with the timetable proposed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may be permitted to reply briefly. I am grateful for the words of the Opposition Chief Whip and for those of the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Graham, that we all share in the interests of the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank. If we did not regard this matter as important, we would not bring it forward in the manner that we have.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para21"></a>A great deal of discussion and thought has taken place. There has been consultation with the police and, I understand, consultation between the Home Secretary and his opposite number in the shadow Cabinet. The conclusion is that the Bill is needed and needed now. The police want it as quickly as possible. I hope that the House agrees that if the enactment saves one life over the Easter break, then the speed of the Bill's passage will have been more than justified.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-19_para22"></a>There will be time for debating some of the issues on Wednesday. I am sure that my noble friend Lady Blatch, who will be dealing with the Bill on behalf of the Government, will be able to reply more substantively to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I take it that the substantial discussion--if there is need for one--on the need for urgency, will take place on the Business Motion that the Bill be taken in one day. We therefore have time to reflect on the balance between civil liberty and civil safety which is clearly here at issue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether I can ask the Government to review the announcement that they have just given to the House. If we look back to 1974 we can see that the original Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed in a 24-hour period shortly after the excesses of the Birmingham bombing. Some of us feel that the result of that action was that we introduced legislation in haste, realising that we would repent it at our leisure. It did a great deal of damage by aiding the IRA as a recruiting sergeant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para0"></a>At that time there was a demonstrable need for something to be done by Parliament and that was done precipitously. The problem with which we are faced as parliamentarians is that there does not appear to be any justification that has been made public to parliamentarians about the urgency of the situation. As I understand it, we shall be presented with a Business Motion on Wednesday to consider the passage of the Bill through all its stages on that day.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para1"></a>I ask the Government to put forward their Business Motion tomorrow, Tuesday, for the consideration of the House. That will give time for consideration of the debate that will be conducted tomorrow on the subject, giving the terms of the emergency of which the Government are apparently apprised and effectively a day's delay before we consider the Bill with which the Government will present us. I put that forward as a plea. <P>


<a name="column_72"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 72</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It would give us some measured opportunity to consider the circumstances of the situation of which the Government will no doubt apprise us.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, the main points made by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, will be taken up during the course of the debate on Wednesday. However, on the issue of the Business Motion, the reason why I came before the House this evening was to let your Lordships know of the Government's intentions and to warn people of both the Motion that my noble friend the Leader of the House is tabling this evening on the Order Paper for debate on Wednesday and also to let the House know of our intended timings.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para2"></a>The Bill would not be dealt with in this way unless we already had prior agreement and also if we did not believe that it was important and urgent for the Bill to be agreed before the House adjourns for the Easter Recess. I hope that the House will recognise the need for this legislation when it comes to be debated on Wednesday and also that the reason I came forward with the Statement today is to keep everybody well informed of our intentions.

<A NAME = "60401-20_para3"></a>Read a third time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-20_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 1, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Refusal of student loan not refusal of credit </B></center><BR>
(". A refusal to an eligible student of a private sector student loan shall not be regarded as a refusal of credit for any purpose and may not be required to be declared in any other application for credit.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the Minister has said on many occasions during the passage of the Bill that the private sector must be free to pick and choose which students to lend money to. Surely it is the case that, unlike other forms of applications for loans from the private sector, the institutions envisaged under the Bill will be receiving public subsidy. Unlike an application for a loan for a car or for a personal loan, an application in this case may be turned down because of the institution the student wishes to attend or the course he wishes to follow.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para5"></a>I do not intend to raise all the issues mentioned during previous debates. Suffice it to say, this amendment does not seek to challenge the right of the private sector to refuse to give loans. However, the amendment would at least guarantee student applicants protection from possible future discrimination in their work or private finance. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, the amendment says only that if someone is refused a subsidised loan for his education from a privately owned company, the company involved will have to say why. It is not that onerous a statement. A refusal of credit may follow someone for the rest of his life. The student has not created the situation--it is the course he or she has <P>


<a name="column_73"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 73</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>chosen to follow. An institution may decide that graduates in English are not a good credit risk. However, someone who passes the examinations for a degree in English well and who acquires a good job may become a good credit risk whereas someone who takes a law course, passes very badly and becomes a very bad lawyer may become a bad credit risk. Surely, when one is taking account of variables and parental income, that should not be held against the student.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-20_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Lord Henley): </B>  My Lords, we return to an amendment we discussed at earlier stages. I resisted those similar, if not identical, amendments for good reasons. I am still not persuaded of the need for such an amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para6"></a>The amendment, if agreed, would have consequences which go far beyond the business of student loans. I simply do not think it would be practical. It is another over-regulatory amendment. It would not only regulate the private lenders of student loans but private lenders of all kinds. That is clear from the first part of the amendment which says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A refusal ... of a private sector student loan shall not be regarded as a refusal of credit for any purpose". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That would affect private lenders of any kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para7"></a>Financial institutions, when considering applications for credit of any kind, must be allowed the freedom to make reasonable, commercially sound decisions. We could not expect them to make special provision for students on the basis of an earlier application for credit, perhaps dating back many years, which probably involved a different financial institution.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para8"></a>We do not lay down rules on what banks and building societies can and cannot do when considering applications for current accounts and overdrafts. We do not lay down rules on whether or not information about those applications, which are not always successful, should be disclosed when the student applies for credit in the future. There is simply no precedent for the provisions which the amendment demands.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para9"></a>The noble Baroness again puts forward the argument, with which I believe I dealt at an earlier stage, that public subsidy is involved in the loans and therefore different treatment applies. I accept that there is public subsidy but it is only a small part of what we are talking about. The major part of the risk is still with the private sector institutions and that is one of the main purposes behind the Bill. It is the banks themselves which have to bear that risk. It is right that they should be able to make their own decisions accordingly.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, said that the information will follow the student for the rest of his or her working life. It is wrong to assume that information about past applications--perhaps many years in the past--will necessarily be of any use or interest to future prospective lenders. The economic climate is always changing and as it does lenders' propensity to lend will change. The applicant's own circumstances may change. He may go from being a not terribly well off student reading English, as I think the noble Lord put it, to being a high flying merchant banker, or even, dare I say it, <P>


<a name="column_74"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a lawyer. It is simply naive to imagine that a mortgage application from a creditworthy young professional will be turned down because he or she was refused a student loan years earlier.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-20_para11"></a>The financial institutions choose their methods of assessing applications and their own lending policies. Those methods and policies may change and will certainly differ between institutions. They know how much their policies vary and that is part of the financial market. Nevertheless, if any financial institution wishes to have a complete credit history before extending credit we believe that it should be able to have it. To refuse that would be unfair and, as I said earlier, over-regulatory. For that reason I hope I can persuade the noble Baroness that the amendment is unnecessary. I trust that she will not feel it necessary to press it this evening.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-20_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, in this Bill we are dealing with an unusual set of circumstances. As the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, said, we are dealing with a situation of paying fishmongers to sell fish. Subsidised loans are not in the same category as private sector loans. The Government believe that there will not necessarily be any connection between a refusal of an application for credit and what will happen in the future. We remain highly dissatisfied with the Government's position. The Minister leaves me no alternative but to divide the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Addington </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960401/text/60401-21.htm"/>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 1, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Statement of reasons </B></center><BR>
(". The Secretary of State shall require any person to whom subsidy is to be paid who refuses to make a private sector student loan to an eligible student to provide the student with a statement of reasons for the refusal.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, there is a very straightforward reason for this amendment. It is that if anybody is refused a loan they should be able to find out the reason why. This follows directly from our last debate and this amendment is something of a fall-back position from it. If a student is refused a loan, surely it makes sense to let him or her know why. As the noble Lord said, having been refused a loan at the start of their adult careers they should be informed as to why they have been refused. That is a very reasonable step to be taken by those giving the new loans, which are government subsidised, if only to a small extent. This is a matter which the Government can quite easily agree to without damaging their own objectives for the Bill. It will also preserve the position for students applying for loans as they start out on their adult careers. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, there are many arguments in support of this amendment <P>


<a name="column_76"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 76</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because of the vulnerability of students. The Minister's reply that it is possible for students to establish a sort of pattern of refusals by looking at other people's refusals, misses the point. There is anxiety. I shall be grateful if the Minister can answer the anxieties in particular of the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities (SKILL), which is concerned because, on 12th March, in a discussion about Amendment No. 10 as regards discrimination on grounds of race, sex or disability, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, confirmed that private lenders would be required to conform to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. However, it is possible that that Act will still allow private lenders to discriminate against potential borrowers with disabilities. At present a borrower cannot be turned down by the Student Loans Company on the basis that he or she has a disability nor on the basis that he or she may be unable to pay back the loan. Borrowers from the Student Loans Company do not start to pay back their debt until their income passes a certain level and, if their income does not reach that level before the age of 50, the debt is written off.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para1"></a>The loans are covered by the Disability Discrimination Act, Part III of which relates to goods, facilities and services. Those provisions outlaw discrimination in general, but list exceptions where discrimination is lawful. One of those (Section 20(4)(c)) allows providers to offer less favourable terms to a disabled person if additional costs are involved. Statistics show that the disabled are less likely to gain employment than other people and that they are less likely to gain well paid employment. Therefore, they constitute a greater risk to a private lender and, as a group, will inevitably cause the lender to incur extra costs. Private lenders would therefore be legally justified in offering less favourable terms to borrowers with disabilities and possibly in refusing credit altogether. Surely it is important as a minimum protection for students in general, and in particular for students with disabilities, that they should be given a reason for any refusal to grant them a loan.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I should like to take the opportunity of this last chance of the Third Reading debate to indicate to my noble friend the Minister that the principle raised in my interventions and in those of my noble friend Lord Peyton, who unfortunately cannot be here tonight--that is, the right of Parliament to scrutinise--has not gone away; nor shall we allow it to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para2"></a>My view is reinforced, if that were necessary, by the report of the Public Accounts Committee, published on 21st March. Its proceedings demonstrate all too clearly that we were right to press the Government to give a firm commitment that once the negotiations with the private sector--if, indeed, they take place--are signed and sealed, proper provision will be made for Parliament to scrutinise on the basis of an adequate amount of detail the arrangements concluded.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para3"></a>The serious breakdown in the operations of the Student Loans Company in the autumn of 1994-95, which left 35,000 students without money for a whole university term, can largely be attributed, on the evidence given to the Public Accounts Committee, to a <P>


<a name="column_77"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 77</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>series of failures to consult either the students or the universities; to secure expert advice on the design of the pro forma; or to make adequate contingency plans. All those mistakes could, and probably will, be repeated in the new scheme, should it ever be implemented.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para4"></a>Another major cause of trouble in the system was undoubtedly the failure to define clearly the responsibilities of the Student Loans Company and of the Department for Education and Employment respectively. As paragraph 25 of the report states:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We note that proposals currently being developed for the Department for a twin-track public/private loans scheme will have an impact on the Company's operations. We observe that Sir Eric Ash's successor as Chief Executive will have to oversee a period of significant change. While we accept that there is an arm's length relationship between the Department and the Company, we emphasise the importance of departmental oversight in this period of change and look to the Department to ensure that proper arrangements are in place". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para5"></a>It is hardly reassuring--indeed, it is deeply disturbing--that in paragraph 43 of the conclusions of the report we read:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We asked the Company how they expected their business activities to be affected by the proposals, recently introduced by the government, for a twin-track public/private loans scheme ... The Company told us that the subject was of 'burning interest' to them but that they did not have enough facts to make detailed plans ... the Company agreed that the process of planning the Company's operations was fraught with uncertainty and this would be a very considerable further complication". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Does the Student Loans Company have those facts now? Perhaps my noble friend the Minister will tell us, particularly as we are also told in the report that, in projecting staff levels, the company was not able to plan more than a few months ahead.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para6"></a> The report continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We asked what proportion of student loans might still be in the hands of the Company at the end of their three-year planning period. The Department told us that, for planning purposes, they had assumed that by the third year of a twin-track system, 25 per cent. of student loans would be provided by the private sector. However, the Government hoped that take-up by the private sector would be considerably greater than that. The Company told us that this would affect the scale of the work they did". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para7"></a>So, we have three players, the department, the Government and the company--and we learn from paragraph 92 of the evidence in the committee's report that the Minister's stated policy--stated in the other place--is,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to hope that all student loans will be done by the private sector in the future". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I think that my noble friend the Minister will agree that, if that is the Government's hope and intention, Parliament has strong grounds for scrutiny of the scheme once the commercial arrangements are in place.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para8"></a>We are entitled to feel concern at the ambiguous and ill-defined arm's length relationship between the department and the company and at the detachment displayed by the department. I cite the Permanent Secretary's reply when asked by the committee what the department did to help to put matters right when they went badly wrong or even to press the company to put things right. I quote:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no doubt in my mind at all that this project was poorly planned and poorly implemented but it was an operational matter for the Company". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_78"></a>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Where have we heard those words before? If, as the report says, consideration is being given to the company being designated as a non-departmental public body, I should like to know the implications for the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para9"></a>In its summary, the PAC echoed the concern that we are entitled to feel, and to which I shall return on future occasions. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we accept that there is an arm's length relationship between the Department and the Company, we emphasise the importance of departmental oversight in this period of change and look to the Department to ensure that proper arrangements are in place". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para10"></a>I end with one last quotation from paragraph 49:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Given the level of uncertainty associated with the Department's proposals, we recommend that they pay particular attention to the potential impact of these proposals on the operations of the Company". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
As Sir Eric Ash observed, the devil is in the detail. We have a right to be able to judge the scheme once it is in place in detail.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly to say that I know the Minister will say that this matter should be left to the private sector and that it is a matter of choice. I have nothing against such a statement, but let us recall what happened with pensions when we moved from SERPS to asking people to take out personal pensions. The final result was tears, with one-seventh of those people being oversold a pension. We later had to amend that legislation with another piece of legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-21_para11"></a>Of course, there is not a strict parallel here, but we could end up with many people being refused credit without a proper reason being given. Six months or even two or three years later, we shall have to amend the legislation because the volume of consumer complaints will be too great. Therefore, I think that the amendment is making a perfectly reasonable request, especially when we remember that the student loan application will be the first loan application that many people make. No matter what the Minister says, if they are not given a proper reply, their copybook will be blotted. We must remember that credit companies share information and that, once somebody has been refused credit, they do not get it thereafter. That is a fact. People become red-lined, just as happens with certain housing areas. That is what will happen. I wish that the Minister would agree that disclosure of such information is not in conflict with freedom of choice.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60401-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede: </B>   My Lords, as we have heard, the Minister's argument time and again has been that a student loan should be treated like any other commercially available loan. We have heard the argument advanced that because there is a public element to the loan, it should be treated with a greater degree of transparency. We heard a second argument from the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that a student has no choice but to take out a loan. Surely we do not want a young person to exercise his or her choice not to be a student.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para0"></a>The third argument, which I believe we should revisit and which has not yet been mentioned tonight, relates to the ombudsman. The Minister said that a student would be free to go to the ombudsman without a written statement of the reasons for refusal. I think it is <P>


<a name="column_79"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extremely unlikely that a young student, busy with his or her studies, could be bothered to make a frivolous complaint about a rude bank manager unless he or she had a piece of paper to back up that complaint. I find that a difficult scenario to envisage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para1"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, several times used the phrase "working with the grain" of the private sector. While I understand the sentiment, I remind him that the state is the client and the banks are the contractors. I believe that it is for the banks to work with the grain of the state in providing a proper degree of transparency and accountability for the Government to ensure that they are doing their work properly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I do not intend to follow my noble friend Lady Park because I do not believe that what she had to say was strictly relevant to this particular amendment. However, I intended to pick up one or two points when we come to Bill do now pass, which might be a more appropriate time to address her anxieties relating to parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para2"></a>I return to the amendment itself. It is a matter that has been addressed both at Committee and Report stages. I have a sneaking suspicion that the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, was not here at Report stage. I apologise if he was here. At that time I addressed the very point about the ombudsman. It is our understanding that the ombudsman does not need specific written evidence to take action to deal with the anxieties raised on earlier occasions. We have made it quite clear that what is required is evidence of any kind.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for what he has just said. Unfortunately, I was abroad and was not here for the Report stage. I read the report of those proceedings in Hansard. I raise the issue again because I found his response inadequate. It is very difficult to imagine a young busy student pursuing a complaint without any paper to back it up on the basis that he or she feels hard done by.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I made clear that there was no need for the evidence to be written. I expanded on the subject of what kind of evidence might be required in a letter that I sent to the noble Lord, Lord Tope. I am sorry that he is not able to be here. Similarly, a letter was sent to the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris. I well understand why he cannot be here. I copied those letters to a number of noble Lords--I even copied my letter to the noble Lord, Lord Morris (but that is neither here nor there) setting out the kind of evidence that could be put forward in making use of the banking ombudsman. I believe that the banking ombudsman has himself made clear, as I made clear at Report stage, that he feels perfectly free to intervene in these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para3"></a>We are not opposed to students being given the information that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Addington, sets out. We very much hope that private lenders will do so willingly, particularly as most, if not all, of the applicants will be existing or potential current account customers. This must be a matter for <P>


<a name="column_80"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 80</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>them. They are lending and risking in the main their own money. They must be free to reject applications and decide what to tell such applicants. We want a normal lending arrangement between lender and borrower rather than the extensive regulation that this amendment seems to imply.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para4"></a>I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, when he says that students have to take out loans. Students are not forced to take out loans; nor do they have to take them out with the private sector. Students are free not to apply for private loans or indeed any loans. If economic circumstances force a student to take out a loan, he or she is always free to apply to the Student Loans Company. All eligible students will continue to have a right to a loan from that company and a right to know the reasons for any refusal. But no student will have a legal right to a subsidised private sector student loan. It follows that the normal lender/borrower relationship, in which there is no legal right to reasons for refusal, will apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para5"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, raised the particular worries of disabled students. As this is Third Reading, it will not be a matter of particular concern if I say that I shall look at some of the points that SKILL has raised with the noble Baroness. We shall make sure that the contracts with the lenders require exactly the same terms for all borrowers, whether disabled or not. We will not allow them to discriminate under this Act against individual students on the grounds of their disability. The contracts will prevent that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para6"></a>The noble Baroness will recall that at an earlier stage I resisted an amendment which tried to write that into the Bill. Thereafter, the usual provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act and the service provisions will apply and the student will have the appropriate protection of that Act. I prefer to write to the noble Baroness about it because I cannot remember the precise details as to when those provisions will come into effect, what they are and what protection they will give. I was not aware that she was going to raise the issue of disabled students. I am sure the noble Baroness will accept that that Act brought in considerable further protection for disabled people in employment, service provision and other matters, and that it is a matter for another day. However, it is a matter on which I hope to write to the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para7"></a>For the reasons I gave earlier, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, does not feel it necessary to press this amendment tonight.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, raised a very important point when referring to disabled students. The Minister's reply was reassuring in so far as it went without giving a reason. I believe that this amendment justifies itself, certainly on the ground of getting the Minister's reply into Hansard. I had assumed that the Disability Discrimination Act covered this to an extent. However, as the noble Baroness spoke, I thought that possibly I was wrong. I have been placated by what the noble Lord has said as to that matter.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para8"></a>As a matter of principle, the idea that this is a normal credit arrangement is not one that holds water. It is a fairly open secret that the Government would like to have loans provided mainly by the private sector. When the initial loans scheme came out, they wished it to be provided by the private sector. It was very open, but none of the private sector wished to take it up. In this case, the loans will account for a high percentage of people's income, especially those in the lower income bracket given the parental background. That is why the amendment is called for.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para9"></a>In those circumstances, it seems appropriate that a reason is given. The Minister says it is hoped that a reason is given. Surely, to require that a one paragraph letter is provided saying under what criteria the loan has been refused is not asking too much. I do not believe that at this stage my case will be helped by pressing the amendment. However, I believe that important points have been raised which will hang over the whole issue. With those comments, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para10"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME="60401-22_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 3, line 21, after ("student",") insert--
<BR>
("(aa) after sub-paragraph (1)(c) insert--
<BR>
"(d) make provision for the level of sums paid by the person borrowing in respect of repayment of any loan to be linked to the income of the person borrowing",").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, at no stage have the Government answered satisfactorily the question put to them by many noble Lords in this House and, most importantly, by the CVCP, regarding the need for a proper income-contingent loan scheme with collection of repayments through the tax or national insurance system. Why do the Government seek to subsidise the administrative costs of setting up a private sector loan scheme based on a system of repayment that is fundamentally flawed? Why would any private sector institution want to participate in a scheme that so many wish to see radically altered? Even the Conservative Party's own national policy group on higher education want to scrap the current system. How can the Minister justify bringing in this extension within such a widely discredited method of repayment?
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-22_para13"></a>The widely welcomed national committee of inquiry into higher education will report just as the proposed private sector loan scheme comes into effect. Any objective observer can see that the current scheme has no friends, and will be scrapped. Surely now is the time for the Government to recognise that it cannot be everyone who has spoken, other than the Government, who is out of step. On this occasion the Government are out of step. They should respond to the widespread concerns which have been raised. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I have made two criticisms of the scheme. The first was that we do not give students enough to live on. I do not suppose that we can change that. The second was that it was <P>


<a name="column_82"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>something of a blunt instrument when it came to gathering in the money afterwards. If we allow the private sector to change the way repayment is made, many of the objections will disappear. The amendment is to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"make provision for the level of sums paid by the person borrowing in respect of repayment of any loan to be linked to the income of the person borrowing". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That means making individual arrangements for the individual in the scheme. Surely that is sensible. It would be responding to market forces, purchasing power, and so forth. Everything is there. We are referring repayments to the student's income. If it is a loan and the lender will get back the money, surely that makes sense. This is probably the last chance saloon for the Government to remove one of the major problems relating not just to this Bill but to the original Act. I fully support the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, I should like to support the amendment. I think that my noble friend Lord Borrie and I both made the point on Second Reading that the 85 per cent. of average earnings was a strict method of arranging repayments. It is hard on a number of students. Although it may have been &#163;18 at the beginning, now that the loan is much greater with the grant being less, the figure becomes much greater. I do not understand the argument put forward by the Minister on Report when he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"But it could be time-consuming and labour intensive to check the income of all borrowers. It would also be costly".--[Official Report, 25/3/96; col. 1528.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I do not understand that, because surely if you are checking whether they have 85 per cent. of average earnings, their income has to be checked. I wonder whether the Minister could explain that. In the meantime, I support a more flexible repayment method which would, I hope, lead to rather fewer defaulters.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I rather resent the suggestion made by the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, that I have not addressed the issue of income-contingent loans and whether they could be repaid through tax and national insurance contributions. I thought that I had made it clear that that is something that Dearing can no doubt look at. It is something that we have looked at in the past. I believe that such schemes are more complicated and more expensive to run than the current scheme which, whatever the criticisms made, has the advantage of being relatively simple and straightforward with, at the moment, a relatively good repayment recovery rate and low administrative costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady David, said that our scheme is surely already income-contingent. She admits that. It works on 85 per cent. She said we have to look at their incomes to decide that and so why cannot we look at other schemes. With the other schemes she suggests, I presume that there would be different repayment levels for different levels of income. That would mean that we would have to look finely at everyone's income rather than use a broad brush <P>


<a name="column_83"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>approach as to whether they are over or not over 85 per cent. It would be a more complicated scheme and therefore necessarily more expensive.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para1"></a>Perhaps I may repeat that the current scheme is, to some extent, income contingent. It is set, as the noble Baroness said, at 85 per cent. of average earnings. That figure, the repayment period of five years, and a whole host of other figures can be adjusted by means of the regulations that exist under the 1990 Act. The Bill does not change those matters at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para2"></a>We could move to a scheme which is yet more income contingent than the current scheme, although the current scheme is already income-contingent. If we did that there may be a greater degree of complexity. One would have to look at the division of costs. If the former student had a more favourable repayment period, one would have to accept that the whole system would be more expensive. These things have to balance. I accept that at the moment students are repaying a relatively low figure. I accept that that figure will increase over the years. That is why each year we have a new set of regulations which allows us to look at what should be the appropriate repayment figure, how long the period should be, and what the 85 per cent. figure should be.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-23_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask a question. If the figure was average earnings rather than 85 per cent. would it be possible to change to that in the regulations?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, it would be possible, yes, because one can shift that percentage up or down. It could up to 100 per cent.; it could go down to whatever. We could do it with some figure other than average earnings. There is a whole host of things that we can do by means of regulations. But, having set up the Dearing review, and having asked Sir Ron to look at these issues in great detail, we feel that there is no point in making a major change at the moment other than the changes that we could make by means of the regulations. For that reason, it would not be wise or sensible for the House to pursue the amendment. I hope therefore that on this occasion the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para3"></a>Lastly, the noble Baroness yet again, as did her noble friend Lord Morris, threw in my face the reports and views of some Conservative think tank. That think tank does not make Conservative policy. Policy is developed by Ministers, as is right and proper. I, on a previous occasion, threw back at the noble Baroness a supporter of one of our schemes--a friend of the noble Baroness, Mr. Frank Field, a Member of another place. I did that just once. It was unnecessary for the noble Baroness to come back yet a third time and mention some Conservative think tank whose views are different from those of the Government. As I said, I believe that these are matters that can and should be addressed by Sir Ron. I hope therefore that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-23_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I am amazed that if there is only a slight difference between the Government and a Conservative think tank, the <P>


<a name="column_84"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 84</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government, who claim to be so flexible, are not prepared to make that slight movement tonight. This is a major change in advance of the committee of inquiry reporting. It is the setting up of a whole new parallel structure which will come into effect just as the committee of inquiry reports.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para4"></a>Secondly, why on earth are the Government so rigid in the way that they want to regulate the private sector? The Minister has said on many occasions that the financial institutions will carry the burden of any failure to repay. Surely we can have confidence in the financial institutions which choose to bear, together with government public subsidy, the enormous cost of setting up a new scheme at the same time as the committee of inquiry is due to report on the change.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para5"></a>Why are the Government so concerned with rigid control and regulation in this instance? Why are the Government not prepared to take the view that if the private sector institutions are risking their money they should be able to make their own choices?
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para6"></a>Finally, the Minister said that no one needs to take out a loan. It is not necessary for those with private financial means or family income to take out a loan, but for many students it is the only means of survival. I remain convinced, but can see little chance of convincing the Minister of his mistake. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para7"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill do now pass. We have completed what is a relatively simple Bill, bar seeking the agreement of another place for the two amendments that I brought forward in Committee. The first was to implement fully our policy that students may take out only one loan per year, public or private. The second was to address the concern that higher education institutes might not obtain a fee for certifying eligibility for a private loan.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para8"></a>It is a relatively simple Bill which is designed to change the current scheme for student loans from a position where there is only one lender--the state in the form of the Student Loans Company--to one where there is the possibility of a plurality of lenders in the private sector while also retaining the Student Loans Company.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para9"></a>As I explained on Second Reading and at other stages, this will bring to the student the benefits of choice and it will bring to the taxpayer the advantages of shifting some of the risk of lending to the private sector. I hope also that it will bring benefits to the lenders themselves and that they will see the attractions and advantages of involvement in the scheme. The perfect deal or contract is, after all, one which leaves all sides of the agreement happy. This will, I trust, leave individual students, the taxpayers and all the financial institutions content.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para10"></a>For a relatively minor Bill, I feared that some if not all the concerns might go somewhat wider than this small part of the student loan scheme. Those concerns were heightened by many of the speeches made on Second Reading, the day on which we announced the forthcoming review of higher education by Sir Ron <P>


<a name="column_85"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 85</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Dearing. I understand, as does the party opposite, why there are concerns about the funding and the future of higher education, in particular as we have seen a number of developments during the past 15 or 20 years. That is why, with the support of the party opposite, we set up the Dearing Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para11"></a>Having done that, and having said that on Second Reading I noticed concerns which went somewhat wide of the Bill, I am grateful that during subsequent stages the debate has been largely devoted to the Bill itself. It has been constructive and largely conducted in an unacrimonious style for which I expressed gratitude. Perhaps I may thank my Whip who assisted me in these matters, my noble friend Lady Miller, and today my noble friend Lady Trumpington. I also thank my noble friends Lord Peyton and Lady Park for their interventions, even though I did not always fully agree with them. I thank them for their support in the Division Lobby on occasions when they felt they could support me.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para12"></a>I appreciate the concerns of my noble friend Lady Park about the parliamentary scrutiny of the proposed contracts with the financial institutions. Indeed, she repeated them today. After debating the matter in Committee and on Report, and after dividing on those issues, I am sure that my noble friends will appreciate that we cannot have parliamentary scrutiny before the contracts are signed or even that the contracts are conditional on parliamentary approval. I made that clear to my noble friend on previous occasions and I know that my noble friend Lord Peyton appreciates that fact.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para13"></a>Nevertheless, I hope that they will accept that I went some considerable way down the road to reassuring them and offering them appropriate assurance. I reassure my noble friend that I am still considering what would be the appropriate form of the statement that I mentioned on Report when we talked about parliamentary scrutiny (cols. 1478 to 1479). I believe it is right that we should announce that to the House in the proper way and I hope that thereafter my noble friend will find ways and means of debating those matters in the usual manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-23_para14"></a>I also offer my thanks to noble Lords opposite, especially those on the Front Bench, for their constructive approach. The noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, unlike some of us, has had the advantage of being able to start his holidays somewhat earlier. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, and the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, even if there were occasions when all three on the Front Bench spoke from the Dispatch Box on the same amendment. I dare say that that was designed to give some idea of numbers. Finally, I extend my thanks to noble Lords who contributed from the Liberal Democrat Benches, in particular the noble Lords, Lord Addington and Lord Tope. I thank them for their constructive approach and their helpful manner. I commend the Bill to the House.

<A NAME="60401-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister said, there has been universal support for the Government's parallel activity of setting up the national committee of inquiry. In that context, the Bill has been described as unnecessary and ill-timed. It does <P>


<a name="column_86"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 86</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nothing to address the immediate crisis facing our universities and colleges and this coming year's Budget means that by 1998-99 &#163;550 million will have been removed from the higher education sector. Further education faces a cut of almost two-thirds in its capital budget during the next three years and 5 per cent. per annum in terms of current expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para0"></a>Even in the context of the Bill, Ministers cannot ignore the problems and wait for the report of the committee of inquiry. The Government should be addressing these problems now in addition to the concerns expressed by Members on all sides of your Lordships' House about the acute problems faced by staff and students. In that context the Bill is not relevant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para1"></a>However, I wish to thank the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, SKILL and the National Union of Students for their helpful briefings. I wish to place on record our thanks to Clare Cozens for her indefatigable work on behalf of us on these Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para2"></a>We welcome the progress that has been made in the course of debates. Progress has been highlighted and welcomed by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals as regards payment for the administration of loans by universities. The Government amended the Bill in response to the universities' concerns regarding payment for their work in administering the new private loans. That is welcome but the universities will wish to be consulted about the detailed arrangements of the scheme once they have been agreed with the financial institutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para3"></a>In relation to parliamentary scrutiny of the detailed arrangements for the Bill, the Minister announced at the Report stage that he envisaged a Statement to the House as the best way of outlining those detailed arrangements. He referred to that again tonight. We on these Benches share the views of the CVCP that both Houses of Parliament should be provided with an opportunity to discuss them. Like the CVCP we too believe that before next year's student loan regulations there should be consultation on the vexed problems facing medical, dental and veterinary students.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para4"></a>The Minister has been courteous and as helpful as he has been able during the passage of the Bill. I thank him on behalf of those on these Benches, especially on behalf of my noble friend Lord Morris of Castle Morris who, unfortunately, is unable to be present today. I know that the custom is that at this stage we wish the Bill success. However, in the light of the criticism received from all sides of the House as regards paying financial institutions to set up an entirely new administrative system based on the mortgage method of repayment with no support, that is asking too much. Higher education is too important to individual students and to the economy to be treated in this way.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para5"></a>However, on behalf of my noble friend Lord Morris of Castle Morris, I thank all noble Lords who have contributed to the points of great concern raised and supported from these Benches. I thank in particular the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth and the noble Lord, Lord Peyton of Yeovil. I thank also the noble Lords, Lord Tope and Lord Addington. Last but by no means least, I thank my noble friends for their support <P>


<a name="column_87"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 87</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>at all stages during the passage of the Bill. Their help and support has been invaluable, in particular to me this evening.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, it falls to me to make the final comments on the Bill. The Bill is a missed opportunity. However, I believe that that is combined uniquely with it being something which will probably never come to pass. I say "probably" because there is a vague chance that it may come to pass. But to do so it must survive a general election and a review. One or other of those occurrences may well do this Bill down.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para6"></a>The scheme was originally rejected by the private sector and I suspect that a similar fate may well await the Bill now, even if it overcomes those other hurdles. We did not manage to improve the Bill fundamentally. The amendment on which we divided sought to improve it in relation to the individual status of students and we failed. That sums up the whole Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para7"></a>Having said that, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, was his usual courteous and charming self while disagreeing with most of what we said. The noble Baroness, Lady Park, and the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, provided interesting and stimulating comment for the whole debate, as did other noble Lords. I should mention in particular the noble Lord, Lord Desai, who often stirs things up to a very interesting pitch. The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, and the entire Opposition Front Bench team made extremely interesting contributions, as did my noble friend Lord Tope. On these Benches, we have not so much had a team as a relay effort. I could not be here for the Committee stage and my noble friend Lord Tope is unable to be here this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para8"></a>If the Bill ever reaches the statute book, I hope that it proves to be vastly more successful than I can foresee it being at present. I hope that it is not merely a continuation of the current loan scheme about which we can all stand up and say rightly, "I told you so".
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para11"></a>Clause 122 [Power of Secretary of State to give financial assistance for regeneration and development]:
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel </B>   moved Amendment No. 218:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 72, line 14, at end insert ("and to more environmentally sustainable patterns of development and living.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 218 standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Dubs and it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak also to Amendments Nos. 220 and 224. We embark now on another part of this rather complicated Bill. Part IV deals with grants for regeneration, development and relocation. In Clause <P>


<a name="column_88"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 88</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>122, certain activities are specified as being contributory to regeneration or development in the sense of the Bill. We believe that there is one primary activity which has been left out and which, indeed, should be the primary purpose of this part. Amendment No. 218 refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"more environmentally sustainable patterns of development and living". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is not an idle phrase. It is designed to ensure that any regeneration or development should not just simply do what is prescribed in subsection (2) of Clause 122 but should, as a primary purpose--that is why we wish to insert it in subsection (1)--introduce the notion of environmentally sustainable patterns of development and living.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para13"></a>Amendment No. 220, again in the name of my noble friend, is in a sense subsidiary to Amendment No. 218. It seeks to add to the objectives of subsection (2):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"preventing land from becoming derelict, contaminated, neglected or unsightly", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and, perhaps more importantly, in paragraph (k),
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"assisting the development of urban land as an alternative to rural land". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In other words, urban land as at present conceived should be considered not just as houses and roads but as part of the rural landscape. If we are regenerating an inner city, there should be some element of considering that land which is being regenerated as though it were rural land in the way in which the Committee normally understands that. It should not be simply thought of as urban land; in other words, building new houses where old houses existed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para14"></a>Amendment No. 224, which is consequential, provides:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Financial assistance under section 122 shall only be given following an assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of any assistance and the consideration of options and alternatives". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I hope that the Committee will realise that in speaking to these amendments and in moving Amendment No. 218, I am placing at the top of the agenda for Part IV the whole question of sustainable development not just in the context of the regeneration of inner cities but in the context of ensuring that the regeneration of inner cities should contribute to the "ruralisation", if I can use that word, of what we are trying to regenerate. It should not just be a question of--I use the old-fashioned expression--slum clearance. It should have a much wider role than that and it should be environmentally sustainable. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-24_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I support all three amendments. It is a particularly appropriate context in which to raise the issue of environmental sustainability. I appreciate that that term has overtones which could give rise to several hours of debate. I do not intend to try to analyse the word "sustainable". But I do not believe that environmental sustainability can be separated from economic or social sustainability. The three concepts go hand in hand and must do so if any of them is to be successful.
<P>


<a name="column_89"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 89</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para15"></a>Therefore, in the context of the part of the Bill which deals with regeneration, it is appropriate and, I think, absolutely necessary to refer to environmental sustainability as a necessary criterion which is fundamental to any regeneration.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para16"></a>The wording of Amendment No. 218 is interesting. It refers to "patterns of development and living". Again, that is extremely appropriate in this context. After all, the object of regeneration is likely to be relatively large-scale or, at any rate, medium-scale. Therefore, it can certainly assist in changing patterns and is not simply a small discrete area of development.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para17"></a>I must say that I read paragraph (k) of Amendment No. 220 slightly differently. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, was going to talk about the importance of regenerating brown-field sites and not spilling on to green-field sites. The notion of "green land", if I may use that term in its widest sense, that he mentioned as part of the urban landscape contributing to the urban framework is a most interesting and important one. Urban quality is essential for urban life.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-24_para18"></a>I mentioned that, in my view, environmental and economic sustainability are inseparable. If our cities are to be economically successful as well as being pleasant places in which to live, they must indeed be pleasant places in order to attract people and inward investment. That is particularly true of the City of London. As regards Amendment No. 224, there is reference on the face of the Bill to the assessment of environmental "effects", so that should not need saying. However, I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, and his noble friend Lord Dubs are right to say that it does.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Strangely enough, the issues raised by this group of amendments have a considerable bearing upon the protection of the countryside. I say that for the following reason. Many people are not satisfied with life in the towns because it is not made attractive enough for them. Therefore, they decide to move out into the countryside, which leads to development that is not always to be welcomed. The more attractive we can make the towns the smaller will be the threat to the countryside. Leaving aside the technicalities of the amendments, I believe that the general spirit behind them deserves consideration for the reason that I have given.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-25_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for the careful way in which they have introduced and spoken to the amendments. We are now moving into a most sensitive area with the subject of sustainable development. My noble friend Lord Renton is entirely correct to say that the more we can develop our cities and improve them the better it will be for the countryside. Otherwise, we shall have to take fresh greenfield sites and leave unused relatively industrialised sites in towns. That would be a great pity. Indeed, that was one of the aspects considered in the rural White Paper.
<P>


<a name="column_90"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-25_para0"></a> I shall deal first with Amendments Nos. 218 and 220. Clause 122 provides that financial assistance can be given for regeneration and development. Amendment No. 218 would extend the purposes for which financial assistance may be given to include,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"more environmentally sustainable patterns of development and living". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Amendment No. 220 would extend the list of activities which can be supported to include the prevention of dereliction and the use of urban, rather than rural, land. They are most important matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-25_para1"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who suggested that "sustainable development" was a curious expression. Indeed, one always has to stop and wonder exactly what it means. It really means that what we have to do is so conduct ourselves that we do not destroy the environment of the countryside for our children and their children when their time comes. However, that does not mean that we cannot have economic progress: that we must have, though it must be carefully dealt with.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-25_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams, said that he puts sustainable development at the top of the agenda and that that is much wider than slum clearance. I agree with him. But that is precisely what the Government are doing. I say that because sustainable development is a major concern of our regeneration policies. It is no coincidence that it is at the top of the list of wider strategies which bidders for the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund are advised to consider in the Government's published Bidding Guidance with which they have to comply when making a bid.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-25_para3"></a>The admirable objectives set out in those two amendments are already covered by the Bill's provisions. Perhaps I may give Members of the Committee an example--the creation of an attractive environment would include action to prevent land becoming derelict. We have tried deliberately to propose broad categories of activities so as to ensure that we can accommodate a very wide range of regeneration and development activities. We would prefer not to go into increasing detail for the usual reason; namely, that if one does so there is always the risk that that will raise doubts as to whether other areas of work are or are not covered.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-25_para4"></a>Amendment No. 224 indicates that the "environmental effects" of any assistance should be assessed before any funds are given to a project. Work to protect and improve the quality of the environment is one of the objectives of the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund. The Government take that into account in assessing bids. Bidders themselves are specifically asked to set out the costs and benefits to the environment of their bid.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-25_para5"></a>In addition, where appropriate, particular development projects will require environmental assessment under the Town and Country Planning (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1988. Under those regulations, environmental assessment is required before planning permission is granted for certain categories of development. For some categories, an assessment is required in every case. For other specified categories, assessment is required <P>


<a name="column_91"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 91</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where the proposed development is likely to have significant effects on the environment. It is not, therefore, necessary to set up a specific mechanism for environmental assessment in relation to assistance under the clauses, because they are already provided for both in the regulations and in the bidding process which is undergone by bidders when they make their offers for work to be done. I understand the reasons why the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, has tabled the amendments. However, bearing in mind what I have said, I hope that Members of the Committee will agree that the matters to which they refer are already covered in regulations and in practice.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Williams, responds, will the Minister consider before the next stage the proposition of putting environmental objectives on the face of the Bill as part of what is already quite a long list? That would help to achieve the Government's stated objective of encouraging such work. In their response to the environment committee's report into the single regeneration budget, the Government published a table showing the percentage of bids addressing the SRB challenge fund objectives at each stage of the bidding process. The environment came pretty low on that list at the point when bids were submitted. It is a good deal higher as a percentage of the bids approved, but it still seems as if those who are making bids needs encouragement to address themselves to the area.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   There is one aspect that the Minister appears to have left out of his response when considering subsection (2)(c), which refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"creating an attractive and safe environment", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and which I believe he used in aid of his suggestion that we should reject the amendment. If one looks through all the matters to be included, there is no reference to energy or its use; or, indeed, to the need for our society to reduce energy consumption. That is something that would be encompassed within the additional words that my noble friend has suggested in his amendment; namely,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and to more environmentally sustainable patterns of development and living". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is one aspect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-25_para6"></a>The other difficulty concerns the way the Bill is written which does not seem to inhibit the development of greenfield sites. Clause 122(2)(a) refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"securing that land and buildings are brought into effective use". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Unless one takes account of,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"environmentally sustainable patterns of development and living", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
it may be considered that building a new factory or warehouse on a greenfield site amounts to effective use of that land. I refer to the building of warehouses just outside the Trafford Park industrial estate on what was effectively agricultural land--a greenfield site--rather than using the derelict industrial site of the Trafford Park industrial estate. There seems to be nothing in the Bill to suggest that developers should use brownfield sites rather than greenfield sites. I wonder whether the date of the noble Earl's letter to me is significant, as it <P>


<a name="column_92"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 92</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was dated 1st April. In the letter he states that he attaches a copy of the draft proposals for the scheme of construction contracts. I must advise the noble Earl that no scheme was attached to the letter. I hope that the 1st April gremlins have not been getting at the noble Earl but I suspect that they may have.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-25_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, seems to be a blighted person as regards my correspondence with him. I felt pleased when I wrote that letter because I thought that I was apologetic to the noble Lord when I should have been. I thought therefore that I had satisfied the difficulty in that I had given him a draft scheme. I am unbelievably appalled to find that that did not reach him either. The reason the noble Lord did not receive the draft scheme the first time was because my noble friend Lord Lucas wrote to everyone who had participated in the Second Reading as regards Part II of the Bill. That must have been about the only part of the Bill the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, did not participate in. Therefore, we did not think he would be interested in receiving the draft scheme. However, the noble Lord may recall that there should have been a set of these publications in the Library and in the Printed Paper Office. Those went astray, as we discussed the other day, but they are in the Library now. I hope that the noble Lord will be able to attach himself to one and not let it go. I am sorry that my letter did not include the draft scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-25_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, was concerned that energy use was not mentioned in the Bill. There is a limit to how much one can mention in statutes. One can make the mistake of including too much. Responsible energy use is very much part of sustainable development. Everyone is deeply conscious of that, in the same way they are deeply conscious of sustainable development. However, one cannot include every facet of sustainable development in legislation. The noble Lord referred to greenfield sites and said there was no inhibition as regards the use of such sites. However, I believe there are inhibitions. The planning policy guidance notes are detailed and specific, and they are being updated. It is important that there should be some forms of development, in a limited way, in the countryside because people have to work and conduct business there. They can only do that if one enables the countryside to share in manufacturing. However, that has to be carefully controlled. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell--as I agreed with my noble friend Lord Renton--that, where one can, one wants such development in the cities. One should not leave derelict areas in the cities while one is developing greenfield sites across the country. I give way to the noble Lord.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   I thank the noble Earl for giving way but he will appreciate that there are nine categories, or aspects, of development listed in the Bill. I suspect that these will be the categories that Her Majesty's Treasury will consider when making financial disbursements. It would seem sad if the Treasury was not to provide grant aid to developments which have as <P>


<a name="column_93"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 93</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one of their features the reduction of energy consumption, bearing in mind the need, which I think the Western world appreciates, to reduce energy consumption in patterns of living and working.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-26_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, need worry his head too much about that, because the whole purpose of sustainable development is to economise on energy and to make the best use of what resources we have. Just because that is not mentioned as one of the nine items in the Bill does not mean that anyone who tries to produce a scheme which includes measures which are conducive to energy saving will not have his scheme considered in the same way as others.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   The noble Earl suggests that sustainable development is important and is something that would meet the various criteria we are looking at. However, that is not stated in the Bill. Are the Government thinking that they will adopt--perhaps not in the wording that has been suggested by my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel--wording to suggest that sustainable development is important and would benefit the Bill if it was written into it?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-26_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   As I tried to explain when I replied to the noble Lord, Lord Williams, sustainable development is right at the top--as he put it--of his agenda, and indeed of the Government's agenda. We have published White Papers and documents on it. Sustainable development is an important matter. If one included it in a Bill, someone like the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, would then ask us to define sustainable development. Then we would become involved in a fearful rigmarole. I do not think that that is desirable. Everyone knows--within reason--what sustainable development means. The Government have explained what they intend to do. Various measures have been set out in guidance notes, in planning guidance policies, in regulations and so forth. Not everything has to be included in a Bill. I suggest to the Committee that it would be best not to include sustainable development in the Bill, as I believe we would get ourselves into more of a tangle than if we did not include it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-26_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked whether, if there were environmental objectives on the face of the Bill, that would not help. I shall certainly consider what the noble Baroness has said. However, I come back to the same argument. I believe that Bills and statutes concern what the law is and what the law states. We should try not to include too many explanatory details as to what the law is supposed to be doing. However, I shall certainly consider the point that the noble Baroness raised.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I support what my noble friend Lord Ferrers said about sustainable development. It really would be absurd to try to define it, with all its ramifications. It is bound to vary from place to place according to circumstances. That is another reason why it cannot be written into a statute in detail.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, my noble <P>


<a name="column_94"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend Lord Monkswell and the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for speaking on this issue. It is an important issue. I am perfectly happy to accept that the wording,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"sustainable patterns of development and living", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
may not be appropriate for a Bill. I am unconvinced by the government view that sustainable development is a vague expression. It has been defined in debate after debate and report after report. Indeed, it is at the head of the Government's agenda, so we are told.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-26_para1"></a>As Amendment No. 218 implies, I should like to see some provision in subsection (1) of Clause 122. It is the primary subsection in the clause. It is the primary subsection in this part. I should like to see a provision which does not simply contribute to the regeneration or development of an area. I wish to see a contribution to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"more environmentally sustainable patterns of development and living". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The words may not be appropriate but I should like to see some provision which sets the tone for Part IV as regards regeneration and development of an area. I should like to see wording which provides for,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"sustainable patterns of development and living". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I can only repeat those words. I believe that if such a provision were in subsection (1), it would meet my concerns and, as I understand it, the Government's agenda.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-26_para2"></a>As regards Amendments Nos. 220 and 224, subsection (2) goes into some detail. It refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"creating an attractive and safe environment; preventing crime or reducing the fear of crime ... providing employment for local people". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Those are detailed matters. I accept that the wording of Amendment No. 220 may not be appropriate but I do not see why we should not have some provision there to respond to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, about assisting the development of urban land as an alternative to rural land, to ensure that trees and grass grow in inner cities as a result of this programme, not necessarily that new buildings are produced.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-26_para3"></a>I hope that the Government will further consider the matter before the next stage of the Bill. If they are serious about putting sustainable development, however defined, at the top of their agenda, this is the clause in which that provision should be put. I hope that the noble Earl will agree to consider the issue to see whether both our agendas can be met.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-26_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   Of course I shall consider the matter. I agree with the noble Lord that it is an important part of the Bill. It is important that we get it right. We have put in what we consider the most appropriate definitions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-26_para4"></a>Having said that, I would not die at the stake and say that this is the only possible form of wording. However, I am concerned that the provision should not be too diffuse and woolly. With the greatest respect to the noble Lord, I wonder what the courts would think of the words in Amendment No. 218,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and to more environmentally sustainable patterns of development and living". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_95"></a>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
How would they be able to consider whether some action was an environmentally sustainable pattern of development and living? I do not quite know what that means although I have an idea.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-26_para5"></a>We seek to put in provisions which can be easily understood. Subsection (2) provides for,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"contributing to, or encouraging, economic development". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is perfectly clear. It also provides for,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"creating an attractive and safe environment". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is clear. The subsection refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"preventing crime or reducing the fear of crime". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
As the noble Lord, Lord Williams, said, that is clear. The noble Lord's wording--he was generous enough to say that it may not be the best--would be a woolly addition which would be difficult to interpret.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-26_para6"></a>Of course I shall consider the matter, including Amendment No. 220 which refers to preventing land becoming derelict, contaminated, neglected or unsightly. I shall certainly consider all those points. I cannot give a guarantee that we shall necessarily find that those are the best words or the most suitable to be incorporated, but I shall certainly consider them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-26_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Without going into the definitions, the environment and the environmentally sustainable concept are at the top of the Government's agenda. It is an objective in the challenge fund bidding. Will the Minister inform the noble Lord, Lord Williams, and myself how that objective is described to those who bid? Since the Government must have defined their objective in some way, we should be able to come together on wording which reflects the reality but also puts the provision on the face of the Bill.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-26_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   The noble Baroness is right. I am perfectly happy with the noble Earl's complaints about woolly wording or whatever it may be. Nevertheless, I believe that there should be some provision in subsection (1) which will help local authorities and others and which will be properly interpreted. The Government can put what interpretation they wish. I believe that environmentally sustainable development should be at the top of the agenda rather than in subsection (2). The Government have to think again. They are committed to the concept, as I understand. There is no difference of intention. We believe that the provision should be on the face of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-26_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   There is nothing between us on what we seek to achieve. Where we disagree is as regards the force of the wording. This is a personal observation. I retain a deep apprehension about putting the words "sustainable development" in the Bill. Whenever I hear those words, or whenever I use them, I have to stop to consider what they mean. If the noble Lord drives his car in a certain way, is he driving it in an environmentally sustainable way or not? I believe that it would be terribly difficult to put such wording into a Bill which would then have to be operated on in a court <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl. As he says, there is little between us. The difference is whether the provision is on the face of the Bill or in guidance notes. If it is in guidance notes, will the noble Earl be good enough to explain to the noble Baroness and myself how the Government interpret Clause 122 in the light of sustainable development and respond to the noble Baroness's question on how they expect local authorities to respond to the Government's sustainable development agenda in requesting financial assistance for regeneration and development? If he can do that, very kindly before Report stage, we shall have to look at his response and consider whether we come back to the issue on Report. I hope that I can rely on the noble Earl to produce a letter to us.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord can rely on me to produce a letter. I am a little worried about whether I shall be able to produce it before Report stage. I suspect that I shall. However, he will have observed that there is a period of relaxation which he will no doubt enjoy over the next week or so and, oddly enough, officials usually enjoy that period too. It may be a little difficult to produce the letter before Report stage, but I shall do my best.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl. I had not realised that officials needed to enjoy a period of relaxation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   They only do that after they have listened to the noble Lord, Lord Williams.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   That is a fair point because they have plenty to think about after I have spoken. I hope that we may receive the reply before we come to Report stage because both the Liberal Democrat Benches and our Benches, with the support of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, I believe, feel that there is an important issue in Clause 122. Unless anything else needs to be added, having had that assurance and in the light of the interval between now and Report stage and the rest that I hope everyone will enjoy, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="60401-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Swinfen </B>   moved Amendment No. 219:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 72, line 21, after ("housing") insert (", including wheelchair accessible housing,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that proper consideration is given to the provision of wheelchair accessible housing when an area is undergoing regeneration or development. The single regeneration budget is one of the major contributors to the regeneration of urban areas. The Committee will be aware that there is currently a shortfall of around 325,000 dwellings nationwide, suitable for people who use wheelchairs.
<P>


<a name="column_97"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 97</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para2"></a>When an area is being redeveloped, the opportunity should be taken to provide more wheelchair accessible homes. Properly designed wheelchair accommodation decreases dependence and reduces the cost of care. It also reduces the limitations on family life. The effect is that the wheelchair user will have a greater opportunity to be economically and socially active, contributing to the community rather than taking from it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para3"></a>I appreciate that it will not always be appropriate to include wheelchair accessible accommodation in each development. However, it is in my view essential that proper consideration be given to the inclusion of this type of home in all schemes covered by the clause. I hope that my noble friend can confirm in his reply that the matter will be given proper consideration. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I support the amendment. I remind my noble friend how splendidly the Government behaved on the question of making, for example, taxis and other public service vehicles accessible for users of wheelchairs. If it can be done for people in a mobile condition, I should have thought it would be even easier and better for it to be done where people live in a static condition. The matter is important and I hope that the Government will be sympathetic about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para4"></a>There may be another way of achieving it apart from the one used in the amendment. However, the amendment raises the issue and it might be a suitable way of dealing with the problem.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, who put the case fairly. Whether the proposal should go on the face of the Bill is a matter which we can discuss, but the thought and the concept are right. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   I wish to put on record the support of these Benches for the thought, although I share the doubts as to how best it could be expressed. The thought is important and it is right to raise it now.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   We sympathise with the amendment but believe it to be unnecessary. Clause 122 provides the Secretary of State with a discretionary power to give financial assistance to persons who incur expenditure in connection with activities which contribute to the regeneration or development of an area.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para5"></a>The clause lists nine examples of activities which are considered to be eligible for support. These include the provision or improvement of housing, to encourage people to live or work in the area or to benefit existing residents. Notably, it also includes activities which benefit local people who have special needs due to disability, in paragraph (i) of subsection (2). The needs of disabled people, including those dependent on wheelchairs, are thus already specifically mentioned in the clause and in a general reference which relates to all the activities listed, rather than just housing. I hope that that will satisfy my noble friend.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   I think it probably will, particularly if the Government agree to an amendment that I have put <P>


<a name="column_98"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>down later on in the Bill concerning building regulations. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para7"></a>[Amendment No. 220 not moved.]
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel </B>   moved Amendment No. 221:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 72, line 34, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) Any financial assistance given under this section shall further any national, regional or strategic planning guidance given by the Secretary of State and any development plan prepared under Part II of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment stands in the name of my noble friend Lord Dubs. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I also speak to Amendments Nos. 222 and 223 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para9"></a>As the Committee will be aware, development plans are required from local authorities under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. It seems to us to be important that those development plans, when they are approved by the appropriate authorities and the Secretary of State, shall have some status which governs regeneration budgets. The amendment that I propose would ensure that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any financial assistance given under this section shall further [development plans or] any national, regional or strategic planning guidance given by the Secretary of State". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I hope that the amendment is almost uncontroversial, but I ask a further question of the Minister. As I understand it, the current funding for economic regeneration projects such as City Challenge is only payable to statutory bodies. Clause 122 would, it appears, allow the Secretary of State to make payments to any such body, although our amendment would restrict it to being within the development plan. But if the Secretary of State were to make payments to a non-statutory body, the question arises: how would accountability of the spending of public money be ensured? I hope that the Minister will be able to answer that question. I have said enough to introduce Amendment No. 221 and I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, will wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 222 and 223. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Amendment No. 222 is not very different in its aim from Amendment No. 221. I had in mind that with a system where central government, both in Whitehall and through its regional officers, runs the regeneration budget, it is appropriate that we should remind ourselves that we have quite rightly a plan-led system. Local authorities create, by no means lightly or quickly, their own development plans. With a system in place for strategic plans, the regeneration which is assisted under those arrangements should fall within the strategies and objectives of the plans. Perhaps more controversially, I do not believe that we should allow the Government's regional officers to set a strategy almost by default.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para10"></a>Amendment No. 223 is about transparency and accountability, requiring an annual report from the Secretary of State on the financial assistance given. The reason that I make that suggestion is twofold. First, <P>


<a name="column_99"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 99</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the system run through the urban regeneration agency, a quango, and through the use of the government's regional officers makes it necessary to ensure that accountability is properly in place and that the decisions can be considered in a proper fashion as well as understood.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para11"></a>The single regeneration budget has brought together a series of programmes of government expenditure which were previously administered separately, each with its own criteria and objectives. I have heard concern expressed that the establishment of a single budget will have the effect of hiding changes which are made to the allocation of funds for different types of activities. That perhaps takes us back to our debate a few minutes ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para12"></a>Previously, there was clear, separate accountability--perhaps that is putting it a little high. There was at least a mechanism for understanding the amount spent on, for instance, housing renovation under the Estate Action programme and services to ethnic minorities. In the case of the former urban programme, the Government made public decisions on the planned division of funding between environmental, economic and social objectives.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para13"></a>Given that there are changes in bringing together those programmes, only after the successful bids have been analysed will one understand what has taken place. I am told that there seems to have been a reduction in the funding previously available to TECs for labour market schemes. I have already mentioned housing renovation. Due to the confusion over Section 11 funding, there has been a significant cut in the funding allocated for services to ethnic minorities. I am told that there has been a net loss of about &#163;7&#188; million in London alone as a result of a first round of challenge fund bidding.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para14"></a>I have recently seen a report on a study by the Chartered Institute of Housing. I understand that the study indicates that, in its view, competition for single regeneration budget cash has acted as a form of rationing for housing schemes. The report said that new or improved housing has lost out to job creation, training and crime prevention in four regions. It comments that it had a low political priority and was even viewed with hostility. I quote from Inside Housing. The report says that some partnerships said that they had been warned off housing projects by government regional officers. I do not know whether the Minister will be able to comment on that and give us some assurances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para15"></a>Clearly, there are concerns about the transparency and the accountability of the way in which the budget is run. For that reason I tabled the amendment.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-27_spnew13"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness said that her Amendment No. 222 was not significantly different from Amendment No. 221 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. I believe that she is right. She said that previously it was much easier to see where money went because it was allocated to various separate plans and it was ring-fenced--a certain amount of money was given for a specific project.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para16"></a>One of the drawbacks of that system was the very reason that the money was ring-fenced. It was decided some time ago that we should move to a single <P>


<a name="column_100"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regeneration budget which puts all that money together, as the noble Baroness knows only too well, and allows people to bid for it. We have found that we have had better value for money that way. I do not want to go into the justification for the single regeneration budget here, but the fact is that that is what happens now and it has proved very successful.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para17"></a>The amendments of both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord reflect points which have been raised before. The Environment Committee in another place considered those areas when it made its first report on the operation of the single regeneration budget challenge fund. The points were also covered when the Government responded to that report.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para18"></a>The amendments would require financial assistance for regeneration and development to relate to planning guidance issued by the Secretary of State and to development plans.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para19"></a>We agree that bids for support under the single regeneration budget challenge fund should take full account of the Secretary of State for the Environment's planning policy guidance, local authority development plans, and other regional strategies such as single programming documents prepared in relation to European structural funds. The bidding guidance for Rounds 1 and 2 drew specific attention to this; and it has been reaffirmed in the guidance for Round 3, which was published on Friday, and which the noble Lord will be glad to know is in the Library. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, will be able to find his copy in the Library and that nothing disastrous happens to his copy. If he does not have an annotated copy, one will be there in the Library for him if he wishes to find it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para20"></a>However, we do not think it is necessary to specify this or other detailed aspects of the arrangements in legislation. That would make the arrangements especially rigid. For example, it is also important that bids should, where appropriate, take account of national strategies relating to sustainable development, and regional or local strategies relating to housing or health. Those national and other strategies are clearly set out in the bidding guidance issued to local authorities and others, and are reflected in the criteria relating to bid assessment by government offices for the regions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para21"></a>The noble Lord was concerned about accountability. In fact, there is no change in the powers of accountability. Payments may already be made to any person under Section 27 of the Housing and Planning Act 1986, which this legislation replaces and the grant offer letter includes conditions which ensure proper accountability by various methods, such as the clawback of grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para22"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 223 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. That amendment requires annual reports of actual and planned financial assistance towards each of the activities listed in the clause. The whole purpose of the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund is to attract and support a group of activities for the regeneration and development of areas. Any one successful bid may involve a range of different projects combining to offer a total approach to local problems. What the public money is buying <P>


<a name="column_101"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therefore consists of several of the statutory activities listed under Clause 122(2). It would therefore be impossible to provide the information sought by the noble Baroness without the imposition of a considerable bureaucratic burden on individual partnerships who, rightly, seek to give priority to making their projects work on the ground. It would have the detrimental effect of encouraging people to think in terms of separate activities rather than of the project as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para23"></a>As bidders put their own money into the various projects, it will be necessary, as a start, to extract that money from the whole in order to arrive at the public money expended. Then, in turn, the public money would have to be separately allocated in the accounts between the various functions. It would be a considerable bureaucratic exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para24"></a>We are keen to establish precisely what achievements are realised by projects, and partnerships are therefore required to report regularly on the outputs of their projects; for example, on the jobs created, the people who have been trained and the homes that have been improved. They also provide overall details of expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para25"></a>The noble Baroness was concerned about housing obtaining its fair share of resources under Round 2 of the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund. There were 172 successful bids planned to construct or refurbish 91,000 dwellings, which is a 26 per cent. increase on Round 1. The noble Baroness was concerned also about Section 11 not receiving its fair share of resources. We are moving away from secular interests towards identifying the wider benefits which ethnic minority communities, voluntary groups and local communities more widely are deriving from the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-27_para26"></a>Therefore, while I understand the reasons behind which the noble Baroness tabled her amendment, it would be considerably bureaucratic and would not work. As I tried to explain, while I understand why the other two amendments were tabled, the Bill is better without being so amended.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960401/text/60401-28.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   The Minister's answer seems to indicate, quite rightly, that the Government assess the various matters to which I referred in Amendment No. 223. I accept that the wording may not be very good and I am not seeking to add to the bureaucracy. I am seeking to ensure that the information as regards the assessments which the Government must make of how the various objectives are being met in comparison to one another is made reasonably available to the public. We have received a lot of information as a result of the environment committee of another place considering the budget and the Government responding to it. I doubt whether the Government want to go through that level of exercise on an annual basis.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am still not entirely clear, even after what the noble Earl said, about the accountability question. As I read the Bill--I can only go on the Bill because, if it is enacted, that is what the law of the land will be regardless of what happened before--under Clause 122 the Secretary of State will be <P>


<a name="column_102"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>entitled, with the consent of the Treasury, to give financial assistance to any person in respect of this, that and thus. Clause 124 states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Financial assistance under section 122 may be given on such terms as the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, considers appropriate". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-28_para0"></a>It therefore seems to follow that the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, may well say that any person could include any person--to put it shortly--and that, if the Secretary of State and the Treasury so decide, any person who wishes to engage in respect of the expenditure, may well receive financial assistance under Clause 122. Therefore, Clause 122, in my reading, allows the Secretary of State to make payments to any body which satisfies the criteria under Clauses 122 and 124 even though it is not a statutory body. I still do not understand how, if the Secretary of State were to make payments to a body which was non-statutory, the accountability as regards the spending of that public money would be achieved. Before I go on with the amendment I hope that the noble Earl can clarify the matter for me.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-28_time0"></A><H5>9.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-28_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I am always only too happy to try to clarify the position for the noble Lord, Lord Williams. We are talking about the single regeneration budget which can be given to various projects. Whereas before, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, certain amounts of money were given for specific items, now it is all put into one pool called the single regeneration budget and people bid for projects. When they bid, they say what they will do.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-28_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams, said that he was quite surprised that the local authority might not be involved and that the Bill as drafted could allow any person to be given funds. That is perfectly true. It could be a person; it could be a company; it could be a non-statutory body. They would come up with a plan and say, "I think we could do this. We could develop this piece of land. This would be our cost. If we had a certain amount of government funding from the single regeneration budget we would be able to do this project". It need not be a statutory body. It could be a person. It could be a company. The whole point is that whether they received the money would depend on the type of bid which they made. That is why the provision is drawn in this way.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-28_para2"></a>The noble Lord then asked how a record would be kept and what is the accountability. The answer is that the accountability comes by virtue of, for instance, the recent report we gave to the Select Committee on the Environment and also in departmental annual reports. The noble Lord was concerned about Clause 122 allowing payments to non-statutory bodies. As I explained, it is the same as giving a grant to anyone. You have to say what you are giving the grant for. The output is then monitored and the reports are audited. That allows payments to be made to the voluntary sector as it does to local authorities or anyone else who can come with a project which is worthy of support and which on the whole is considered of all the bids put forward to be the most likely to give good value for money. As the noble Lord will realise only too well, <P>


<a name="column_103"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when government funds are given towards projects, they are not just given and forgotten; they are monitored, reports have to be made and information is published at the end of the year in various departmental reports.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   Reports may be made and various departmental reports may be issued but I simply do not understand that concept. I must stress that point. Now we know that the purpose of the Bill is to allow private bodies of one form or another--as the noble Earl said, companies, individuals, whoever it may be, and not local authorities--which come up with a scheme to regenerate the centre of Bristol, the centre of Llandrindod Wells or wherever it may be and which perform under these criteria to get the money. The noble Earl went on to say that the money will be monitored and that departmental reports will be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-28_para3"></a>I do not think that is satisfactory. I find it very odd that public money can be disbursed to private individuals or private companies which conform to the criteria and have projects to do this, that and thus and yet there is no accountability other than, as the noble Earl said, annual reports from one department or another. I find it an extraordinary concept. I hope very much that the noble Earl will be able to reassure me that that is not really what the Government mean.

<A NAME="60401-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   We seem to have moved away from Amendment No. 221 and to have moved on, if I understood the noble Lord, Lord Williams, correctly, to Amendment No. 223. Amendment No. 221 has the effect of limiting the expenditure under the clause to items subject to planning guidance under Part II of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-28_para4"></a>I merely rise, while information is being collected, to point out that there appear to be two, or possibly three, items in subsection (2) which could not be the subject of planning policy guidance of any sort and which do not fall within that Act. Therefore, the effect of this amendment, whatever it is on accountability, would be to narrow the deployment of funds. The amendment would be unfortunate in that respect.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-28_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I want to try to help the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, a little more. He said that money can be obtained and given to any single person, and that sort of thing. He makes it sound as though that is wrong. It has been going on for quite some time. Someone may want to complete a building project. The building company says that it will cost so much and if it gets a grant, it will be able to build so many houses. They may be homes for old people or others. The company will put forward a bid. It will say how much money it is able to contribute and it will approach the Government or seek a contribution from the single regeneration budget. When the budget is worked out, one has to discern whether the bid would be better for that area than any other bid. If it is, then the correct forms of application and so forth have to be filled in. The money is carefully "monitored", to use that awful word yet again. The money is put into the project and the results are seen. One knows how many houses have <P>


<a name="column_104"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been built and how many people are housed. That is the kind of way in which the project is managed and looked after. That is a wholly commendable way.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   This comes back to my Amendment No. 221. The point about these schemes is that they are a partnership between local authorities and other sources of finance. That seems very desirable. I have no particular problem with that although I have about the single regeneration budget, but I shall leave that aside.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-28_para5"></a>I have a problem with the Bill, as drafted. I may be quite wrong and I am open to correction, but a purely private sector consortium, regardless of any local authority, development plan or strategic planning guidance and the rest of it, can say "I have a project to regenerate or develop 'an area'", in the words of the Bill. Provided that the purely private sector organisation conforms to the criteria of Clause 122, as approved under Clause 124, it will be in receipt of public money. That is quite different. I emphasise again what has happened as regards City Challenge and even the SRB. I simply want to know if that is the Government's intention. If it is, please let us know and we shall take it up at a later stage. This is quite different to what has happened before.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-28_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord asks whether it is possible for someone to come forward with an idea and say that they are going to develop something without any guidance or planning permission. Of course, that is not so. Any project that is brought forward is subject to all the planning rules and applications that are necessary. Nobody would introduce a scheme which did not have planning permission. It would be a matter of prudent management to decide at what point one applies for planning permission. Presumably, if one has a project, one does not produce it without having checked whether it will be likely to get planning permission. So it is perfectly possible for a firm or business to say, "This is a project for building houses" or whatever, and that might be done in concert with, or for, a local authority and the local authority may not be involved. However, it would be able to do that by making a bid and those who assess that bid will do so against a whole host of different bids for the region. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, asked whether it is possible for a private body to have public funds. The answer is yes it is when it is doing something for an area and for which it is making a bid and where that bid is deemed to be the best bid for the improvement of that area.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60401-29_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   At the risk of detaining the Committee for just another minute, perhaps I may put one point on the record. I should like to thank a voluntary organisation in London--voluntary in the sense that it is funded in part by the Corporation of the City of London but collects funds from other sources also--called Vision for London. In reporting on the successes and failures of bids in London, that organisation has produced the most accessible and one of the most helpful reports that I have ever seen. I mention that because I do not think that this is the right way to run the country or the scheme. Reporting <P>

("( ) borrowing approvals to local authorities,
<BR>
( ) the raising of any capping limit to enable local authorities to meet revenue expenditure associated with financial assistance given under section 122,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-29_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 225 is grouped with Amendment No. 226 which stands in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. It may be convenient if we discuss the two amendments together. Concentrating briefly on Amendment No. 226, it is intended to make it entirely clear that local authorities have the power to do things for which the Secretary of State is enabling the funding to be provided--I apologise to the Committee for the cumbersome language that I have just used. It is important that all potential partners are assured that those activities are intra vires in order to allow partnerships with the private sector to take place; otherwise the private sector will be frightened off, as we have seen recently.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-29_para6"></a>Amendment No. 225 has been tabled to seek assurances that the assistance that is given may include the lifting of controls on expenditure by local authorities to the extent required to enable them to play their part in partnerships for regeneration. I have mentioned specifically borrowing approvals and the raising of capping limits. I have included borrowing approvals because local authorities need permission to borrow money. I have included the raising of any capping limit because capital expenditure has revenue consequences and if revenue cannot be spent because of a capping limit, the debt cannot be repaid and that will constrain regeneration activity which involves capital expenditure. Those matters are important and need to be addressed although perhaps not in the way that I have dealt with them. However, I am afraid that I was unable to resist the opportunity of highlighting the way in which local authorities may be forced to contribute to the partnerships in a less complete way than many of them would like. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="60401-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I speak to Amendment No. 226. It is grouped with Amendment No. 225 to which the noble Baroness has spoken. The noble Baroness has correctly pointed out that there is some <P>


<a name="column_106"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 106</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difficulty about the vires of local authorities to become involved in the regeneration and development of their areas. The purpose of Amendment No. 226 is to put this beyond doubt. The Committee will be aware of the recent case of Allerdale District Council v. Credit Suisse which has raised the question whether local authorities have the power to support particular forms of regeneration not specified by statute. That uncertainty has discouraged the private sector from participating with local authorities. In Allerdale District Council v. Credit Suisse the High Court ruled that a guarantee given by the district council to the developer of a recreational facility was ultra vires. As a result, the contract was made unenforceable and void.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-29_para7"></a>It is clear that the companies involved took legal advice. They were advised that they should not collaborate with local authorities--this advice has been given by lawyers since--where there was uncertainty or doubt as to whether those authorities had specific powers to undertake the activities concerned. This is anomalous in view of the increasing pressure on local authorities to act in partnership with the private sector, which we support. The Committee will generally acknowledge that the ultimate aim is to secure more regeneration work undertaken on a partnership basis. There is doubt about the vires of local authorities as a result of this decision and other cases. The amendment is designed to clarify the position so that local authorities and companies, private individuals and institutions can feel comfortable about co-operating in regeneration matters.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-29_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I deal first with Amendment No. 225 proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. This would extend the list of possible forms of assistance to include credit approvals to enable local authorities to borrow to fund capital projects. It would also raise capping limits to help authorities meet revenue costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-29_para8"></a>Assistance under the single regeneration budget challenge fund is available to a range of bodies including, but not limited to, local authorities, and for both capital and revenue projects. We decided to offer a form of support that provided the maximum flexibility and was of benefit to everyone. Therefore, at present we provide assistance in the form of grants. The single regeneration budget was formed by a combination of 20 existing programmes that offered support by both grant and credit approvals. We moved to a grant-only regime having first consulted the local authority associations to ensure a simple, flexible system that could be used to fund capital or revenue projects by the range of bodies already supported under the single regeneration budget, and by the broad-based partnerships which submitted bids under the single regeneration budget challenge fund.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-29_para9"></a>We believe that it would be a retrograde and unnecessary step to return to credit approvals. Most partnerships would continue to need grant to support revenue projects, or to support capital projects by private sector partners. So projects would receive a combination of grant and credit approvals. That does not mean that the Government's funding will be any bigger. <P>


<a name="column_107"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>All it means is that it would come via two routes. That would create greater bureaucracy within individual partnerships and in offices for the regions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-29_para10"></a>Decisions on capping limits are taken by the Secretary of State each year in the context of the demands on local authorities, and the interests of the national economy. Adjustments to capping limits do not generally reflect the consequences of individual decisions of various local authorities on their spending priorities, such as that resulting from an authority's successful bid for assistance under the single regeneration budget challenge fund. It would be inappropriate to use primary legislation to dictate the factors which should be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-29_para11"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 226 proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. This would seem to provide that, once the Secretary of State has given financial assistance towards an activity falling within Clauses 122 to 125, that general function would become a function of local authorities generally.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-29_para12"></a>District councils and unitary authorities already have a widely drawn economic development power under Section 33 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. This broad power, and other specific provisions which exist in separate legislation, allow local authorities to undertake a broad range of regeneration activities, and are sufficient to allow them to participate fully in work related to the single regeneration budget.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-29_para13"></a>These clauses relate to the Secretary of State's powers to give support. He can support local authorities which spend under their proper powers. If there were any doubt about those powers, that would be a separate question. For those reasons, it would not be appropriate to include the two amendments in the Bill. I hope that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord will agree to that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   Has the Minister--I am sure that he has--considered the case of Allerdale District Council v.Credit Suisse? It is an important landmark case as to whether local authorities have the vires to make a contract, whether they have the vires to enforce that contract, and whether the other parties to the contract have the vires to enforce that on the local authority within the context of the present law? I am advised that at the moment that is not the case without clarification. That is the point of the amendment. Local authorities should, as we all agree, be entitled to enter into proper partnerships with the private sector to encourage regeneration. I hope that the Minister has considered this case carefully and can give us a proper response before I sit down.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-29_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I would not give a proper response before the noble Lord sat down, I should wait for him to sit down. Now that he has sat down, I shall give him the response. It would have been discourteous to have us both on our feet at the same time. I should prefer to give a considered answer later about a specific case. It would be inappropriate to discuss an individual case upon which there has been a legal judgment. If I may, I shall write to the noble Lord about the matter. In general, the case to which he referred (Allerdale District <P>


<a name="column_108"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 108</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Council v. Credit Suisse) concerned a local authority's guarantee powers, whereas the clause that we are debating relates to the Secretary of State's power to give assistance. It concerns guarantees and not regeneration. That is as far as I can go at the moment but I will consider the noble Lord's points and write to him.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-30_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Amendment No. 226 refers to local authority powers as they are affected by the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers. As regards Amendment No. 225, the Minister said that it would be retrograde. It is sad that allowing local authorities to play their part as I have suggested is regarded as a retrograde step. It is perhaps a little odd too in these days when the use of private finance is encouraged. It also tends to suppress the community leadership role of local authorities, which is a role that I should like to see supported. The hour is late and I shall not pursue the point now. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>

<BR>
("(1) The Secretary of State shall consult local authorities and relevant interests regarding the regeneration and development of the regions and publish regional strategies for regeneration and development, in which he shall have regard to the views expressed in such consultation.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 227 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 228. No doubt the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, will speak to her Amendment No. 229. The purpose of the amendment is to provide what I would call a strategic background against which to judge bids for support from the single regeneration budget and other funding sources. Perhaps I ought to declare a minor interest in that I am President of the Federation of Economic Development Authorities. It is purely an honorary position but the economic development authorities--district councils which have economic development departments--are involved in bids for the SRB.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para5"></a>Judging from my experience of the Federation of Economic Development Authorities and other bodies, there is a difficulty about the transparency of decisions regarding the allocation of funds for regeneration and <P>


<a name="column_109"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>development. The purpose of the amendment is to improve that transparency and to encourage collaboration between central government, local authorities and others in developing some kind of strategic framework for the future development of United Kingdom regions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para6"></a>There is anxiety among local authorities and others preparing SRB bids that the process of deciding which bids should be accepted and which should be refused is not transparent. Amendment No. 227 achieves three aims. First, it requires the Secretary of State to consult local authorities and other relevant bodies about the future regeneration and development of their region and to have regard to their views when deciding on the priorities or criteria to be used in deciding between different SRB bids. Currently there appears to be something of a policy vacuum within regional offices where decisions on individual SRB applications are taken. I am afraid that that gives rise to some suspicion, however unworthy, that decisions are taken on political grounds rather than on grounds of a contribution to a particular area. A strategy, if put in place, would provide an indication to bidders of the types of project which should be brought forward for further local regeneration.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para7"></a>Secondly, it appears that the government regional offices vary very markedly in the extent to which they provide to those submitting SRB bids feedback as to why the bids were successful or unsuccessful. Indeed, when consulted--and I am advised by the federation of which I am president--government regional offices vary widely in the advice which they are prepared to give to local authorities in putting forward a bid. Some regional offices are very forthcoming and others not so forthcoming. The amendment requires the Secretary of State to give reasons in writing, which is reasonable, to bidders as to the success or failure of specific bids.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para8"></a>That feedback is particularly important because it will encourage bidders in future rounds to improve their submissions; to improve the way in which they present their case; and will improve their chances of success. That would be seen as at least a minimum level of courtesy following the expenditure of large amounts of time and money in preparing the bids. One local authority I know spent over &#163;1 million of its council taxpayers' money in preparing a bid. That is a great deal of money. As it happened, the bid was successful. But many bids which have cost a great deal of council taxpayers' money as well as public money have been unsuccessful. Feedback will also provide proof that all bids have been considered carefully.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para9"></a>Thirdly, because the costs of preparing SRB bids are high, this amendment gives the Secretary of State discretion to reimburse some or all of the costs incurred in making bids which are commendable although unsuccessful. That happens frequently. Local authorities are told, "It was a very good bid, quite right, but unfortunately you were unsuccessful". This amendment would ensure that what are known in the trade--if I may use the expression--as near misses are not disadvantaged by the bidding process since costs of bids can be considerable.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para10"></a>I very much hope that the Government will take seriously these two amendments because there is a genuine problem in relation to the costs of SRB bids and the strategy which lies behind the single regeneration budget itself. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My name is down to Amendments Nos. 227 and 228, and Amendment No. 229, which is in my name, has a very similar aim to the amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord Williams, has just spoken.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para11"></a>The fact that the implementation of the budget is not consistent across the country is not necessarily bad because, after all, there are different needs and different priorities in different places. But what is worrying is that it is not possible to understand the basis for decisions, as the noble Lord has said.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para12"></a>The effect of the SRB so far has given rise to concern that funds have been allocated on a basis less closely related to the needs of different areas than has been the case in the past, as well as the basis for the allocation of funding between areas having become less explicit. I understand that the Association of London Government has assessed the degree of relationship between the SRB and the Government's own index of local conditions and, further, that the effect of the SRB so far has been to reduce the degree of fit between resource allocation and need. Indeed, I believe that some areas of high need have been missed out.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para13"></a>As I said, patchiness is not necessarily wrong but it seems in this case that perhaps it is. The effect of the proposed clause is to suggest that, rather than being reliant on a bidding system the Government might decide in advance how much an area should receive, so that the basis of allocation of funding would become more explicit. I was surprised to learn that it is only in London that there is real evidence of competition for resources, and that in most other regions the number of bids submitted does not greatly exceed the number that are funded. It seems, therefore, that there is perhaps not the competitive process that was originally envisaged. Again, that is not necessarily a bad thing. It may be the natural result of key partners in an area working together to submit a joint bid under the leadership of the local authority. However, in London it seems that particular bids each year are especially favoured by the regional office. Major established partnerships--one can think of Park Royal, Stratford and the South Bank--bid each year, and are likely to be funded each year. I question whether that approach is an appropriate one. As I have said on previous occasions, I have my doubts--indeed, more than doubts--about the benefits of competition. If it is to be the same projects which are to receive the lion's share of resources, that negates the objective of a competitive system. I support this group of amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-30_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   These are meaty amendments, if I may so express it. I refer to the first two amendments in the group, Amendments Nos. 227 and 228, which stand in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. The amendments return to concerns which have been expressed in the past, <P>


<a name="column_111"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>primarily by local authorities, about the operation of the single regeneration budget challenge fund. The Environment Committee in another place considered these areas in its first report on the operation of the single regeneration budget, and most of these points have been covered in the Government's response to that report.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para14"></a>We welcome the committee's general conclusion that the single regeneration budget challenge fund has already demonstrated its potential to achieve excellent value for taxpayers' money; and that it does not think the Government should make major changes to the programme's operation. The Environment Committee felt that the Government were on the right course. That is encouraging. Amendments Nos. 227 and 228 cover several points. First, Amendment No. 227 would require the Secretary of State to consult local authorities and other relevant interests, and publish regional strategies for regeneration and development. There is a regular dialogue between government offices and key local players to discuss regeneration issues and priorities. That is a prime function of government offices. However, we do not believe that it would be practicable to try to incorporate the existing diverse arrangements into a formal exercise, nor that it is necessary to publish the results. The Environment Committee concluded that regional regeneration strategies--if we were to have them--would add a layer of bureaucracy, and risk making the bidding process for the single regeneration budget challenge fund unnecessarily cumbersome and restrictive. We therefore would not wish to adopt that course.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para15"></a>Secondly, the amendment would require financial assistance under Clause 122 to have regard to published regional strategies.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para16"></a>As I said earlier in relation to Amendments Nos. 221 and 222, we agree that bids for support under the single regeneration budget challenge fund should take full account of the planning policy guidance of the Secretary of State for the Environment and local authority development plans, as well as other regional strategies such as single programming documents prepared in relation to European structural funds. The bidding guidance for rounds one and two drew specific attention to this; and it has been reaffirmed in the guidance for round three.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para17"></a>The amendment would require the Secretary of State to make arrangements to reimburse bodies for the costs of preparing applications for funding, to which the noble Lord, Lord Williams, referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para18"></a>The Select Committee agreed with Ministers that resources invested in bids for the single regeneration budget challenge fund were not necessarily wasted. Most losing partnerships have stayed together, and have looked for other funding or have put in new bids. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, said that if they were to be reimbursed it would encourage the bidder to continue to bid. I dare say it may. But the fact is that there would be no extra money available. Therefore that which was paid out to the losing bidders would not be available to other constructive bids. Although there is clearly an <P>


<a name="column_112"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expense and a drawback in losing a bid, nevertheless it has been shown that those who bid tend to stay together and are successful in later bidding.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para19"></a>Partnerships not successful in round two will be able to bid again for round three funding. Government offices will give advice to them, and other bidders, to assist in drawing up bids. The bidding guidance for the challenge fund deliberately stresses that bids for support should not be presented in a glossy or elaborate form. They should include the minimum information necessary to enable a bid to be assessed, and translated into action if it is successful.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para20"></a>Finally, the amendment would also require the Secretary of State to write to applicants, giving them reasons for the success or failure of their bids for funding, on the same date as the decisions are announced. In fact, that is what happens. Government offices wrote to all partnerships who were unsuccessful under the first two single regeneration budget challenge fund bidding rounds. They offered such partnerships a meeting to discuss why their bid failed, how it might be strengthened in subsequent rounds, and what alternative sources of funding might be available. Most of the partnerships took up the offer of a meeting, and many were subsequently successful in round two or are bidding again in round three. For those reasons I do not think that the first amendments are desirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para21"></a>Amendment No. 229 stands in the name of Lady Hamwee alone. She has lost the noble Lord, Lord Williams, on this amendment. I do not know why; perhaps he did not approve of it. The amendment would enable financial assistance to be given to local authorities on the basis of annual regeneration plans. Our view is that local authorities have important roles to play both as members of local partnerships and with other interested parties in helping to bring together bidders. The bidding guidance we have just issued for round three of the single regeneration budget challenge fund reflects our wish to see local authorities playing this central role. But we are looking for real local partnerships, which fully involve other parts of the community; and we agree with the Select Committee's recommendation that we should not give local authorities a formal strategic role in relation to the bidding stage of the single regeneration budget challenge fund process.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para22"></a>Overall, we believe that the present arrangements for the operation of the single regeneration budget challenge fund are adequate, although we will certainly keep them under review and see how they can be improved as time goes by. This reflects the Select Committee's advice against making major changes to the programme. We do not think it would be helpful to specify certain aspects of the arrangements in legislation, as this might limit the continuing process of improvement.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-30_para23"></a>The simple and short answer to all three amendments is that the single regeneration budget challenge fund is working quite well. The Environment Committee said it thought it was working well and advised against making too many alterations. I suggest to the Committee that it would be inadvisable, after that advice, to change what <P>

<A NAME="60401-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl. It is the first time that I have heard a Select Committee of another place being prayed in aid by the Government. Normally, Select Committees of another place are critical of governments. Nevertheless, if the Government rely on that evidence, we note it. In future cases where Select Committees of another place are critical of the Government, no doubt the Government will also rely on their opinion on other matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para0"></a>The Government must pay attention to the problem. Whatever the Select Committee of another place says, there is substantial disaffection in local authorities about the SRB on the lines that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and I have mentioned. I believe that it is not such a bad system, others take a different view and think that it is terrible. It is not such a bad system, bar the fact that it does not encourage assistance to go where it is needed, it goes where there is reasonable presentation. That is my experience and that of others.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para1"></a>I do not wish to press the amendment at this hour of the night, but the Government would be sensible to pay serious attention to the points made this evening. In the light of the noble Earl's response, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="60401-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel </B>   moved Amendment No. 230:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 73, line 36, leave out ("are") and insert ("will be").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 230, it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak also to Amendments Nos. 231, 232 and 250. We are now dealing with relocation grants. The purpose of Amendments Nos. 230 and 231 is to allow a local housing authority to seek confirmation from the Secretary of State that contributions towards relocation grants will be payable by him in respect of a specific proposed clearance area before passing a resolution to pay such grants.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para9"></a>The Bill introduces relocation grants which may be used by local housing authorities to assist people who lose their homes as a result of clearance activity. As I understand it, the grants will supplement existing compensation provisions to enable people affected by clearance to purchase a replacement dwelling and can be paid after a clearance area has been made. The decision to make relocation grants available must be made before making the clearance area. That is the ground on which the amendments are based.
<P>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para10"></a>Local housing authorities will be required by Clause 126 to do a number of things before deciding. Clause 134 merely says that the Secretary of State may make contributions towards relocation grants paid. In the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill, it is suggested that relocation grants will be financed from public expenditure released by the change from mandatory to discretionary renovation grants. That comes as something of a surprise because it is contrary to the suggestion made in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. Savings will not, in our view, be made by the change from mandatory to discretionary renovation grants. As we have argued over Part I time and time again, the same number of unfit houses will remain to be dealt with the day after the change is made as the day before the change was made.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para11"></a>So there can be no changes as a result of a change in the scheme from mandatory to discretionary provision. Furthermore, local housing authorities are likely to have to divert more of their limited resources to fund mandatory disabled facilities grants after the change. There can be no extra money for relocation grants. My amendment is designed to seek confirmation that the Secretary of State will pay whatever is necessary in respect of proposed clearance areas before local housing authorities pass a resolution to pay those grants.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para12"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 250, which is designed to ensure that subsidy is made available for relocation grant in the same way that renovation grants at present receive subsidy. The Secretary of State already has powers to make contributions towards the cost of renovation and disabled facilities grants, currently at the rate of 60 per cent. of expenditure. As we know, those powers are repeated in Part I of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para13"></a>It is important for all grants to be dealt with in a similar way in order to ensure a proper balance between the different options for renewal. That is particularly important in relation to the balance of action between repair and replacement, which is what we are talking about when discussing relocation grants. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-31_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My amendment No. 232 is grouped with these amendments. I can understand that there may be a knee-jerk reaction to the notion that capital receipts may be released to be used for the purposes that I suggest. However, I do not feel that those purposes are so very wide.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para14"></a>The amendment refers to Section 290 of the Housing Act 1985. That section refers to local authorities' acquisition of land after they have declared an area to be a clearance area. Under Section 289(2):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The local housing authority shall declare an area to be a clearance area if they are satisfied ... that the houses in the area are unfit for human habitation or are by reason of their bad arrangement"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
the reference is to the arrangement of streets--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants ... and that the other buildings ... in the area are [similarly] dangerous or injurious to ... health". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Further, it states that the most satisfactory way of dealing with the matter is the demolition of buildings in the area.
<P>


<a name="column_115"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para15"></a>That is not a decision which is taken every day of the week by every local housing authority up and down the country. The amendment proposes that capital receipts received from the disposal of land previously subject to that type of action can be used by the local housing authority toward further investment. I use the term "investment" quite deliberately--not random, profligate spending.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para16"></a> I am well aware that restrictions on the spending of capital receipts are intended to reduce the local authorities' debt but they have the effect of reducing the local authorities' capital bases and, I suggest, their power. One of the reasons underlying the controls on the use of capital receipts is a wish to reduce local authorities' capital bases. But it also means that local authorities are restricted in their ability to invest; and coupled with other restrictions on capital expenditure, as I said earlier this evening, their hands are very much tied.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para17"></a>This is not therefore an extensive amendment. I do not believe that it will have huge implications. However, it could be extremely important and useful in the limited number of places where such actions are taken.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   These amendments are all about the resources which will be available to local authorities to enable them to give relocation grants. Amendments Nos. 230 and 231 concern the resources condition in Clause 126(3), the purpose of which is to ensure that authorities do not commit themselves to future expenditure on relocation grants recklessly. In our view, it requires each authority to be generally satisfied, on the basis of its current level of resources, that it would be able to meet the sort of expenditure that such a commitment would imply.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para18"></a>The wording follows that in Section 289 of the Housing Act 1985 which requires authorities to be satisfied that their resources are adequate before declaring a clearance area. Although this, like the decision to pay relocation grants, implies a long-term commitment of resources, the wording seems to be generally understood and has not caused any problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para19"></a>In relation to the specific questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, the point is that if authorities have discretion they can allocate resources according to their own priorities. They will therefore be able to pay relocation grants if they wish from within the overall level of their resources.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para20"></a>Amendments Nos. 230 and 231 are unacceptable because they would require local housing authorities to be satisfied about the future availability of resources and for the Secretary of State to give them cast-iron guarantees on that. No government can give any such assurance because public spending decisions have to be taken afresh each year taking account of the amount the country can reasonably afford to pay. The Secretary of State could therefore not give the absolute confirmation about resources which Amendment No. 231 appears to require. Authorities would therefore be unable to satisfy themselves on this and so would never be able to exercise their power to give grants. I am sure that that is not what the noble Lord intends.
<P>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para21"></a>I can, however, assure the noble Lord that it is certainly our intention to pay contributions towards the cost of relocation grants for the foreseeable future. We would expect to do so at the same rate as for slum clearance subsidy; that is to say, 60 per cent. Amendment No. 250 seeks to relate the amount paid to the level of contributions towards the cost of renovation grants under Part I, but we see no merit in that. Nor is it clear to us that a requirement on the Secretary of State to have regard to that level would establish a clear link in any event.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para22"></a>Amendment No. 232 seeks to enable local authorities to fund the provision of relocation grants using capital receipts from their slum clearance activities. If we wished to do that, we could do so under our existing powers in Section 59 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. However, allowing authorities to use receipts which they would otherwise have to set aside to meet credit liabilities would, if unchecked, add to public expenditure. Furthermore, such a change might also affect different authorities in different ways. Some authorities may not have sufficient receipts to meet the demand for relocation grants at the time the demand arose.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-31_para23"></a>In conclusion, we believe that funding for relocation grants should be met from within the overall level of resources allocated for private sector renewal, with a 60 per cent. Exchequer subsidy as already mentioned. I hope that, on the basis of those explanations, the noble Lord will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-32_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I wish to speak at the same time to Amendments Nos. 235 to 239 and to make reference to Amendment No. 234 which stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Williams.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-32_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 233 and 235 to 239 are to make clear that relocation grants may be payable whether properties in clearance areas or surrounding lands are acquired compulsorily or by agreement. As currently worded, Clause 128(1)(a) provides that a person is a qualifying person for the purposes of eligibility for relocation grant if among other things he has an interest in a dwelling in the clearance area which has been, or is to be, compulsorily acquired. The definition of "compulsory acquisition" in subsection (6) of Clause 128 was intended to encompass all acquisitions, whether compulsory or by agreement, under Section 290 of the Housing Act 1985 or Section 154 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. However, we feel that the provisions are open to misinterpretation and that it would be best to clarify the situation. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, will see that we have succeeded in incorporating the intent of Amendment No. 234.

<P>

<A NAME = "60401-32_para16"></a>Amendments Nos. 240 to 247 are to clarify the rules for determining the maximum amount of relocation grant which may be paid and to bring the rules for applying the means test more closely into line with those which apply for renovation grants. In particular, those who are displaced by clearance activity will be required to put the compensation they receive for the loss of their old home towards the cost of buying their new one.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-32_para17"></a>Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 make minor changes to the rules governing the repayment of grant when one of the grant conditions is breached. Amendment No. 248 <P>


<a name="column_118"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has the effect that the grant will not have to be repaid where the property is passed on under a will or intestacy to someone who lived with the deceased person throughout the 12 months ending with the date of his death. Indeed, that was our intention in drafting the Bill but Amendment No. 248 as originally drafted required an impossibility, which was that the new tenant should have lived with the deceased after his death.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-32_para18"></a>Amendment No. 249 is to deter someone who wishes to move out of his home within five years of the purchase from escaping his obligation to repay grant by first selling the property to a member of his family. In these cases the grant repayment condition will become binding on the new owner and the same will apply if a person passes on his property under a will or intestacy.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-32_para19"></a>Amendment No. 251 clarifies the definition of "owner" for the purpose of the relocation grant provisions by explaining the meaning of "net annual value", which is used in that definition. Amendment No. 264 ensures that only those provisions in Clauses 122 to 124 of Part IV of the Bill will extend to Scotland. Clause 125 has no relevance to Scotland. I understand that any decision whether to introduce relocation grants north of the Border will be taken when Ministers there come to reform the improvement and repairs grant system, at which time they will also review associated statutory powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-32_para20"></a>Finally, we intend to bring the provisions of the relocation grants into force on 1st April next year. Amendment No. 266, when read with Clause 144(3), will enable us to apply for that day by order of the Secretary of State. I beg to move.

What happens if it is a rented home?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel </B>   moved Amendment No. 252:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 79, line 45, at end insert--
<BR>
("(3) Grants under this section shall be available to--
<BR>
(a) any applicant in receipt of income support, family credit, housing benefit, council tax benefit, disability working allowance or disability living allowance, or
<BR>
(b) any applicant over 60 years of age.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak also to Amendment No. 253 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. We embark here on home energy efficiency schemes, which were introduced in 1991. The purpose of my Amendment No. 252 is to abolish the introduction of means-tested criteria for applicants for home energy efficiency schemes grants who are over 50 years of age. I do not believe that I need enlarge on the object of this amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, may well argue that the introduction of a form of means-testing for pensioners will compensate for the reduction in HEES funding by allowing a reduced sum of money to go further, but experience suggests that that is not the case. The requirement to pay 75 per cent. of the cost of works for those not on means-tested benefits will be a significant deterrent to take-up. Measures adopted by regional electricity companies have offered a range of support for energy efficiency measures. It has been shown that grants of less than 75 per cent. are not successful, with very little take-up below that level. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   The issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, are of considerable importance. There was a commitment in the previous Finance Bill for the home energy efficiency schemes to be funded to a total of &#163;100 million for three years. That commitment was repeated by Ministers throughout last year and as recently as last May. The result of that commitment was that an increased number of homes, particularly of elderly people on small incomes, were insulated and, as a result, much energy saving was achieved. There was a gearing up of the staff required to carry out that work.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para5"></a>The results of the measures now intended--that is, the reduction of &#163;31 million in the &#163;100 million originally vouchsafed and the means-testing of people of pensionable age--will have serious repercussions. I turn first to the case of people of pensionable age who will be means-tested. Very many people of pensionable age who do not receive income support (which is the test), in fact do not claim it although entitled to it. The DSS has estimated that about one-third of pensioners do not claim who could do so. Quite apart from those who could claim technically, a large number of pensioners live just beyond the level at which they could claim but they cannot afford to pay the extra amount. They will thus be deprived of the insulation benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para6"></a>As a result of the cut-back, some 200,000 fewer homes will be insulated. There will be a loss of 1,000 jobs in small businesses. Some &#163;12 million which would otherwise have been expended on insulating materials will not be so expended. That will not only mean greater disadvantage in environmental terms, but will have a <P>


<a name="column_121"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>serious impact on health. A sobering statistic is that excess winter deaths in Britain in recent years have increased to something like 55,000. That is vastly in excess of excess winter deaths in any other western European country. In Denmark, which is at the other extreme, there are very few more deaths in winter than in summer, because of attention to good housing conditions. There is very little doubt that those extra deaths are of elderly people living in cold and damp conditions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para7"></a>Therefore, I believe that the measures that the Government now propose to cut that vital expenditure, to subject pensioners to means-testing and to widen the scope of the use of the reduced availability of funds so that even less will be expended on insulation, will have serious adverse effects--serious from the economic, environmental, health and social points of view. Therefore, in the light of the difficult situation created by the clause, I very much hope that the Government will think again.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-33_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Williams, in his amendment, Amendment No. 252, wants to ensure that any future domestic energy efficiency grant schemes will be confined to the same groups of people as are eligible for the existing home energy efficiency scheme. The present power allows grants to be paid only as prescribed by regulations, which may make provision for, among other things, the types of dwellings to be included, details of the work that may be done and the categories of people who may be eligible for grants. This is quite deliberately intended to give maximum flexibility within the overall purpose of improving the thermal efficiency of dwellings, reducing or preventing waste of energy and giving people advice about energy use.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para8"></a>I understand the desire of the noble Lord to put into primary legislation the social aims of the present scheme, but Amendment No.252 will have the effect of restricting unnecessarily the flexibility which the present power provides. It is a flexibility which Clause 136 will extend, which several noble Lords and others have welcomed. I think that what is suggested is a retrograde step. We could not reflect any future changes to the social security benefits structure without the lengthy procedure of a new Bill to amend the Act. I do not believe that Amendment No.252 will do any more to help the elderly, poor and disabled than is already being done through the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme. We are committed to continuing to help those vulnerable groups. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, will accept that point of view.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para9"></a> As regards Amendment No. 253, the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said that we had given an undertaking in the sum of &#163;100 million for three years. I knew that this would come up. I remind the noble Lord--as I have before at Question Time--that the undertaking was to go up to &#163;100 million for that year and to increase the base line to &#163;100 million for the next two or three years. As a result of that, the noble Lord suggests that the Government have been disingenuous. Although those are not his words, that is the inference to be drawn from his comment.
<P>


<a name="column_122"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para10"></a>The noble Lord knows only too well that all government departments operate on base lines. They must all proceed over the next two years not on undertakings but on base lines. The base lines inevitably have to be altered from time to time. Every year in the terrible Public Expenditure Survey round the Government, like any other business, have to decide, where cuts can be made if cuts have to be made. The fact was that it was necessary this year to make cuts. It was not an undertaking last year that for the next two years that money would be available, only that the base line would have that money available.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para11"></a>I understand the desire to maintain the grants paid under a very successful scheme. But it would be quite impossible to suggest that a figure should be written into a Bill. It would be extraordinary to have a funding commitment and power dealing with a grant scheme in a Bill. One can hardly envisage the effect of having every expenditure commitment enshrined in primary legislation. Of course, that is not the noble Lord's intention, but if this amendment is accepted the commitment will be enshrined in legislation. I suggest that that would be wholly wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para12"></a>The noble Lord is concerned about the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme. I remind him that householders may be eligible for one or more benefits: income support, housing benefit, council tax benefit, family credit or disability working allowance. All householders age over 60 are eligible for grant, but from 1st April the grant is limited to 25 per cent. if claimants do not qualify on any of the grounds that I have just mentioned. We are targeting the money available to those who are most inconvenienced in the community, and those householders who are 60 and over and do not qualify for other grants because they happen to be better off do not get 100 per cent. grant but still get a 25 per cent. grant. That is a reasonable way in which to deal with the matter. People who took advantage of the grant have benefited from it. We are targeting the grant on those most in need of it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I do not follow what the Minister said about the &#163;100 million. I have many quotes about it from Ministers. I shall relate just one which is at variance with what we have just been told. Mr. Robert Jones, a Minister in the Department of the Environment, in a Written Answer in another place on 22nd May, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"During l995-96, some &#163;100 million will be made available for grants, and a similar sum has been set aside for each of the next two years".--[Official Report, Commons, 22/5/95; col. 386.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I do not see that that can mean anything but a firm commitment by government at that time for &#163;100 million to be made available for l995-96 and that further similar sums were set aside for the succeeding two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para13"></a>It does not seem to me that that accords with what the Minister was saying. If the Government have changed their mind, as they evidently have, that is an unfortunate fact, and that is what I am arguing against. As to the impact, it will mean--whatever way it is looked at--that 200,000 homes which would otherwise have been insulated will not now be insulated; and a <P>


<a name="column_123"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>number of deaths from damp and cold conditions which would otherwise have been prevented will not now be prevented.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-33_para14"></a>The Government were moving in the right direction. I believe that at the time the Prime Minister was very much in favour. I have no evidence for that, but I was told he was. Having taken a step which brought so much extra comfort to the elderly and people on low incomes, it is unfortunate that the Government have now taken part of it away without notice, without consideration of previous commitments and without thought of the enormous amount of good it was doing and will no longer do. We should return to the matter if the Minister is not prepared to give any assurances at this stage.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-34_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I must try to explain the position, because I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is labouring under a misapprehension, although not deliberately. It is true that &#163;100 million was allocated for l995-96, and that a similar sum was--to use his expression--set aside for the following two years. When one sets something aside, one puts it in the baseline. No government will normally ever undertake to have a certain expenditure guaranteed for following years, because governments do not operate in that way. They operate from the baseline. That was increased, and that was as it should have been.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para0"></a>It was only when considerations had to be made in a stringent public expenditure survey that it was decided to make the cuts here. We said that those people who were, as the noble Lord said, elderly and on low incomes would be the ones to benefit from the grant. Those older people, who are not the poorest and who do not have these other grants, do not receive 100 per cent. grant; they receive 25 per cent. Before this happened, and when the grant was 100 per cent. all noble Lords who had the pleasure of being over 60 were eligible to have the grant. With a limited amount of funding, it seems wrong to give that grant to people who could themselves afford to pay.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para1"></a>Let us remember also that when the grant is paid, it is not one lump sum; it is given, for instance, for loft insulation, tank or pipe lagging, or draught proofing. They are separate items. If the whole work is carried out one receives &#163;15-worth of energy efficiency advice too. All the work comes to &#163;315 per house. I understand that it is rare that a household qualifies for all the grants available under the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para2"></a>I do not want the Committee to get the matter out of perspective. Those people in the poorest parts, those who are least well off, will still have the grants available to them. Those who are more than 60 years old but who are not the poorest people will still have the scheme available to them but at a 25 per cent. grant. I do not believe that we have been wholly disingenuous.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para3"></a>I do not know where the noble Lord found his figures about how many house will no longer have the work done. I do not understand how he can work that out. I can tell him that the scheme has been a considerable success. More than one and three-quarter million grants have been paid since it began in 1991 and research shows that households receiving grants can on average <P>


<a name="column_124"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>save about &#163;39 a year if they maintain their heating patterns. The grant scheme has been a success and we have tried to aim it at those people who need it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-34_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   Perhaps I may make a comment now rather than detaining the Committee on the Question of whether Clause 136 shall stand part of the Bill. The Minister has told us what a considerable success the scheme has been. The amendments in the group have been tabled in order to maintain that success and that is the reason for my concern about the clause. It may seem inconsistent to support energy conservation and the home energy efficiency scheme while at the same time opposing the clause. However, I believe that it is the Government who are inconsistent in seeking to extend the scheme while reducing the means.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para4"></a>I believe that the focus of the scheme should remain on heating and insulation improvements rather than extending it to energy efficient appliances and lighting. I say that given the limited budget, about which we have heard, and the urgent needs of the client group to which my noble friend Lord Ezra referred.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, put their fingers on the point: there will be less money for a good scheme and it will be spread more thinly across the population. We should like it to be concentrated or for it to have more resources, if that is possible. However, the Government's approach seems to me to be wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para5"></a>Nevertheless, having listened to what the noble Earl explained at considerable length, at this time of night it is right to bring the debate to a conclusion and to see whether we shall return to the matter at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: It is not my intention to move the amendment at this stage. However, I wish to make it clear that I shall return to the matter at the next stage.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment adds to the requirements of the reporting under the Home Energy Conservation Act. At about this time of night last Thursday, my noble friend Lord Rodgers was referring to 30,000 disappointed architects. Perhaps this is the point at which to refer to a potential 200,000 disappointed home owners.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para11"></a>The amendment seeks to require that the contribution of the home energy efficiency scheme to the improvement of energy efficiency in residential accommodation is considered at the same time as the Secretary of State gives his report summarising the progress made by local authorities on implementing the measures contained in home energy conservation reports required by the Act to which I have referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para12"></a>The Act requires the Secretary of State from time to time to prepare that report. The home energy efficiency scheme can make a significant contribution towards helping to meet the target energy efficiency improvements under the Home Energy Conservation Act. The Department of the Environment estimates that some 20 per cent. of heat is lost in the average house through the roof and 15 per cent. through draughts through doors and windows. Moreover, there are very considerable reductions in CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions to be achieved by dealing with these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para13"></a>I believe that the home energy efficiency scheme should be considered as an integral part of the strategic approach to home energy conservation which the Home Energy Conservation Act envisages. This amendment would assist in achieving that end. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-34_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Baroness is quite right to suggest that it is important to identify the contribution of programmes such as the home energy efficiency scheme to the achievement of significant improvements in energy efficiency. Guidance in the form of a recent Department of the Environment circular indicates that "significant" will be interpreted as 30 per cent. I would certainly expect that any report from my right honourable friend would identify the progress made by authorities in encouraging the take up of grant and the contribution that will make towards the overall target. I must confess to some confusion over the reference to "could have been made". I think that it would be undesirable for my right honourable friend's reports under the Home Energy Conservation Act to speculate on the hypothetical, or indeed appear negative by considering contributions that could have been made.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para14"></a>There is also concern that the amendment requires my right honourable friend to give undue prominence to the contribution of home energy efficiency schemes in his report to Parliament. However, I hope that what I have said will reassure the noble Baroness that those reports will certainly cover the important contribution which <P>


<a name="column_126"></a>

<A NAME="60401-34_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   What the Minister has said has helped me with the drafting of my amendment for the next stage of the Bill when perhaps we shall spend a little longer on these important topics to which I fear we are not really devoting as much attention as some of us would like to see, given the late hour. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 136, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Provisions for disabled people in construction of new dwellings </B></center><BR>
(" . The Secretary of State shall exercise his powers under section 1 of the Building Act 1985 to introduce an extension to Part M of the Building Regulations 1991 in order to ensure that in the construction of new dwellings reasonable provision shall be made for disabled people to gain access to and to use the entrance storey of the dwelling including sanitary conveniences.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: In 1985, the Government introduced Part M of the Building Regulations for public and commercial buildings. Those specified minimum standards of access for disabled people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para17"></a>In January of last year, the Department of the Environment produced a consultation paper proposing that Part M be extended to include new residential dwellings. The proposal was for the introduction of two new requirements. The first was Regulation M5 which stated that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Reasonable provision shall be made for disabled people to gain access to and to use the entrance storey of the dwelling". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Regulation M6 stated that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Reasonable provision shall be made for sanitary conveniences on the entrance storey of the dwelling which allow access and use by disabled people". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The stated objective of the new requirements was to allow occupiers to be able to invite disabled people to visit them in their own homes without undue hazard or inconvenience, and to be able to cope better with reducing mobility and to stay put longer in their own homes. I understand that the Government consulted 185 organisations directly but that they received over 1,000 responses, and that the principal opposition to the extension of these regulations came from private developers in the form of the House Builders Federation and its members.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para18"></a>The principle of extending these regulations was supported by a large number of disability and housing organisations, including the National Federation of Housing Associations. I understand that the consultation period finished in April last year. That being the case, it is now almost a year since the consultation ended. The Government have in my view, and in the view of a number of other people, had considerable time to analyse the responses. There is concern that this matter is on permanent hold.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para19"></a>Extending Part M to residential dwellings would bring all new homes in line with those built by housing associations as well as being consistent with the Government's own regulations for commercial and <P>


<a name="column_127"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>public buildings. I understand that the design by housing associations is a requirement of the Housing Corporation, a Government funded body. All new non-domestic buildings and extensions must provide access and facilities for disabled people. Those are mandatory requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para20"></a>Since 1993, performance standards for accessibility apply to all new housing built for rent by housing associations in England and Wales. The extension of Part M to housing would create more convenient and flexible housing for parents with children, pregnant women, people with temporary injury, older people, people with a chronic medical condition, and disabled people. The basic structural criteria that allow easy access and adaptation are: parking, where provided, to be suitable for use by disabled people; avoidance of steps and steep ramps in entrance paths, and in entrance doorways; sufficient door widths and circulation space to allow easy passage for disabled people; electrical switches and sockets and mains controls sited within easy reach; and a WC at entrance level. Staircases should be suitable for the future installation of a stairlift. In blocks of flats the communal areas and lifts should be large and suitable for use by disabled people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para21"></a>One in four households includes at least one person with a disability according to the OPCS 1991 national census. A high proportion of people with long-term limiting illness have mobility limitations. Arthritis Care estimates that 8 million people have some form of arthritis. I understand that some 300,000 people each year suffer a heart attack. Conditions affecting the mobility of younger people include asthma in one in 10 children, Aids, and disability caused by accidental injury.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para22"></a>The changing age profile of the UK population means there will be 600,000 more people over 80 in 2010. In 1992 over 15 per cent. of borrowers for new dwellings were 45 years-old or over. In 1995 the Halifax Building Society, in an experimental marketing initiative in its Brighton estate agents, found a huge demand for housing with accessible features, but no houses coming onto the market which were accessible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para23"></a>A cornerstone of government policy is care in the community. The strain on the public purse of adapting existing, unsuitable housing currently runs at more than &#163;80 million per annum. An unknown and far larger sum must be spent by private individuals. Can we really afford to continue to build unsuitable housing?
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para24"></a>Accessible housing does not mean unattractive housing. It is not about concrete ramps and handrails. Those only become necessary when typical private sector housing must be adapted. The cost of implementing Part M is very small in relation to total development costs. Developers would have a competitive advantage in relation to existing housing stock. In the long term there would be a reduction in the need for adaptations and other community care facilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-34_para25"></a>The new Housing Bill--it is a government Bill currently going through another place--places a much greater emphasis on provision of housing by the private sector. It therefore becomes even more important that <P>

<P>
<A NAME="60401-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My noble friend Lord Swinfen makes a strong case. We launched a White Paper in January 1995. We undertook to consult widely. We were astonished at the number of responses we received. As my noble friend says, there were over a thousand, many of them full and complex comments on the range of specific measures proposed. Assessment of those responses has been a long and complex task which still continues. Once that task has been completed, recommendations will be made to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State on the measures to be introduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-35_para0"></a>Until that time comes, I am afraid that my noble friend Lord Swinfen will have to wait. We have powers under the Building Act 1984 to make the necessary changes should they be agreed, and when the time comes that is obviously a course of action we shall consider. However, at the moment I urge my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.

I have a feeling that the private building industry may be putting pressure on my noble friend's department in this respect, but I could well be wrong.

Page 80, line 4, after ("section") insert ("and by prior agreement with the relevant statutory body").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60401-35_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: In the interests of energy efficiency I shall be brief. Under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 a UDC's assets can be disposed of in three ways, one of which is the transfer to a local authority statutory undertaker, or other body, by agreement. The Bill proposes a fourth method: transfer by order to a statutory body.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-35_para4"></a>Some assets are unencumbered by liabilities. Many assets are encumbered by liabilities. I seek merely to ensure that a basic safeguard included in the 1980 Act is included in this Bill by providing for the agreement of the transferee in order to enable that transferee to avoid <P>


<a name="column_129"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>liabilities being dumped on it. It is a fundamental provision of contract law in this country that you cannot assign a liability. It is not the case everywhere else. I believe that the old arrangement requiring agreement is a good provision to follow. I do not think that the Government should allow themselves to be seen as able to arrange the disposal of liabilities, even if that is not the intention as I dare say we may be told. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401-35_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   First, I apologise to the Committee for having been unavoidably absent for the earlier part of the evening. I support Amendment No. 256 and it might save time if I said a brief word about Amendments Nos. 257 to 260. I wish to speak to them all together because the point I want to make encompasses all the amendments. It concerns what happens when powers are handed back or when the UDCs, HATs and new town corporations are wound up and decisions must be taken as to what is to happen to their assets.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-35_para5"></a>My argument, as embodied in the various amendments, is that the assets should be transferred to local authorities rather than being sold off. It is a fundamental point and there are a number of reasons which I wish to mention in support of it. First, in the case of UDCs and HATs, many of the assets originally came from local authorities and it is only right that they should revert to the local authorities from which they came. Secondly, local authorities, with their planning and other powers, are the most appropriate bodies to take an overall view of what part the resources from UDCs, HATs and new towns should play in the local area.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-35_para6"></a>Thirdly, local authorities have a breadth of experience going back over the years in terms of planning estates, the law and so on. That could be mobilised to solve the problems of the former UDC areas, HATs and the new towns. It would ensure proper continuity in the various areas. Fourthly, if there are any liabilities arising from the various bodies, then local authorities are best fitted to take over and finance the liabilities in an appropriate way. Fifthly, and perhaps most important, local authorities are directly accountable to their electorates. They are permanent bodies and therefore would avoid the uncertainty that would arise from an attempt to sell off the assets to whomever it might be, which would stop the sense of continuity and lead to more uncertainty in the local areas. Local authorities can take a broad view of the concerns of their areas rather than a purely financial view as to what will earn the most money.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-35_para7"></a>For all those reasons, I feel that the amendments are sensible. The disposal of assets simply for short-term financial gain is not the way forward and I hope that we shall see local authorities as being the obvious successor bodies to UDCs, HATs and new town development corporations.

<A NAME="60401-35_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   Let me say at the outset that the Government have no intention of, as the noble Baroness put it, dumping the residual responsibilities arising from the winding up of local development corporations on to a body which is reluctant to accept them, as we realise that it is most unlikely that it would then apply itself <P>


<a name="column_130"></a>

<B>1 Apr 1996 : Column 130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seriously to completing the tasks which it had inherited. Once an organisation has accepted the role of residuary body or a new body has been set up for that purpose, it would defeat the whole object of the exercise if it were then able to pick and choose the things which it was prepared to take on and leave those which it did not want to accept.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-35_para8"></a>The urban development corporations are currently disengaging from as many of their assets and liabilities as possible, either through sales on the open market or, in the case of physical liabilities, by means of transfers on mutually acceptable terms to local authorities or other public bodies. We therefore do not anticipate that there will be enormous amounts of work remaining to be done after wind up. But there will inevitably be some issues remaining and many of them will be complex, if not totally intractable, requiring the application of specialist skills and knowledge to their resolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-35_para9"></a>The main reason for setting up a residuary body is to provide a safety net to catch everything which the urban development corporations have been unable to clear up before wind up and which would otherwise have to be administered directly by the Secretary of State. If that body were then able to refuse to take on certain functions, he would be no better off than at present, while the advantages in terms of economies of scale and the development of appropriate expertise of having all such matters dealt with by a single body would be lost.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401-35_para10"></a>I hope that that has been able to satisfy the noble Baroness and has been able to remove some of her anxieties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401w01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   The article of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 providing for the prosecution by all parties or persons alleged to have committed grave breaches of the conventions do not cover breaches of Common Article 3. Additional Protocol 2 to the Geneva Conventions does not contain any provisions for the prosecution of grave breaches. As regards crimes against humanity, there is no international agreement providing for universal jurisdiction over such crimes, though it is proposed that they should form one of the categories of crimes over which the proposed International Criminal Court should have jurisdiction. We are aware that certain organisations are collecting and assessing information relating to events in Halabja in March 1988.

These arrangements do not include purely national capabilities, including the surveillance capabilities of the United States.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Answer given by Earl Howe on 19th March (WA98), why the Ministry of Defence have chosen to assess the attitude of members of the Armed Forces towards the recruitment of homosexuals but not of members of ethnic minorities.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401w02_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   A survey into the attitude of members of the Armed Forces towards homosexuality was conducted as part of the department's recent homosexuality policy assessment, recommended by the High Court following the unsuccessful challenge made last year to the legality of the policy by four former Service personnel. The Armed Forces are, with certain qualifications where nationality and residence rules are concerned, Equal Opportunities Employers under the Race Relations Act 1976; we therefore see no requirement to conduct a similar assessment of the attitude of Service personnel towards the recruitment of ethnic minorities.

<P>

<A NAME = "60401w02_para22"></a>- introduce fees for many consignments of special wastes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401w02_para23"></a>The new regulations contain a number of deregulatory initiatives, designed to make the system easier to operate while ensuring that special waste is soundly managed and safely reaches appropriate facilities. Provisions include specific criteria for determining whether or not waste is special, to keep to a minimum the number of wastes which will be subject to these regulations, consistent with the overall aim of securing adequate levels of environmental protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401w02_para24"></a>These regulations also introduce fees, in line with the "polluter pays" principle, to recover the costs incurred by the Environment Agencies for ensuring compliance with the regulations. A fee of &#163;15 will be payable for most consignments. Consignments of automotive lead-acid batteries will attract a fee of &#163;10 because they will be subject to lower levels of regulation.

<A NAME="60401w03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Currently there are 116 immigration officers based at Waterloo International, all of whom are engaged in carrying out passport controls on Eurostar services. This level of staff is sufficient to carry out passport control on board all services from Paris except those which we have agreed with European Passenger Services will not have on-board clearance. In addition, there are occasions when practical difficulties, such as staff sickness, lead to the cancellation of a scheduled on-board control. We do not have spare staff at Waterloo International to cater for such circumstances; it would clearly be very wasteful of resources to do so. In the absence of on-board controls, we seek to delay passengers as little as possible at our control at Waterloo International and to meet our published service standard for maximum queuing times.

<A NAME="60401w04_wqn2"></A><B> Earl Russell </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What legal criteria they employ to identify two people as an unmarried couple.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60401w04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   For the purposes of deciding entitlement to social security benefits, decisions about whether a man and a woman are living together as an unmarried couple are made by adjudication officers. Guidance on the factors to be taken into account is issued by the Chief Adjudication Officer. The adjudication officer will normally consider whether the alleged couple share normal household tasks, how long the couple have been together, whether they share bills and other household expenses, if other people regard them as a couple, and whether there are children of their union or they share responsibility for childcare. Information about a sexual relationship is not requested, but if volunteered, will also be taken into consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "60401w04_para0"></a>Decisions are made on the facts of the individual case. The criteria do not represent a rigid formula, and the presence or absence of any single factor will not by itself determine the decision.
