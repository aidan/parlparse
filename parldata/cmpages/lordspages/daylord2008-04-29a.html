The port authority has a duty to ensure the safety of navigation on the River Thames. Recently, this has involved felling riverside trees. This is not a matter for government intervention. The port authority consulted locally and adapted its plans before starting work. It will consult further as part of a structured tree management programme, including compensation planting.</p>

I am glad to hear that the PLA is going to consult further, but would it not have been better if it had consulted much more widely before felling half the trees on a particularly beautiful stretch of the river bank at Hammersmith? Will he do his best as Minister responsible for the environment to ensure that in future the PLA gives full priority to the needs of the environment when making its plans?</p>

Regulations 1994, does the Minister agree that it is desirable that no further work should be undertaken on the tree-felling programme before an environmental impact assessment and the promised tree survey have both been completed and made available to the public for widespread consultation?</p>

I do not think that we should necessarily assume that it is bad for the environment that an element of felling or pruning takes place. We have to consider the impact of unseeded tree growth on the retaining walls and the subsequent effect not only on cyclists and pedestrians using the towpath but on those who use the rivers, such as rowers.</p>

The local authority has the right, the duty and the authorisation to put tree preservation orders on trees that are of value to the community. If the local authority can put a preservation order on a yew tree in my small garden, surely it can do something to protect the Thames riverbank.</p>

However, if I had, I would probably put one on the noble Lord&#146;s yew tree. Tree preservation orders are generally the responsibility of the local authority, and the PLA has to its credit been in detailed consultation with Richmond borough council. That has to be right.</p>

The Learning and Skills Council, which has operational responsibility for EMAs, has recently launched a new EMA marketing campaign designed to increase EMA take-up even further.

Among those eligible for the &#163;30 EMA band, who are the most disadvantaged part of the cohort, 92 per cent take it up.

The noble Baroness is right to say that certain parts of the further education world would like additional financial support to be provided, but we are making a good start with EMAs. The greatest indicators of propensity to continue studying are achievements in AS- and A-levels, and level 3 qualifications. EMAs are pushing up levels of achievement among 16 to 18 year-olds, which are much higher than they were previously.</p>

As my noble friend said, 540,000 students are in receipt of education maintenance allowances&#151;an increase on 430,000 only two years ago.

However, the noble Baroness has drawn attention to an important option for 16 to 18 year-olds: apprenticeships, which combine work with part-time training. There has been a substantial increase in apprenticeship numbers in recent years and we are committed to a further increase, so that, alongside the raising of the education and training participation age to 18, there will be an opportunity for all young people to undertake an apprenticeship if they wish to do so.</p>

Policies, including the introduction of educational maintenance allowances, are helping to increase participation but, as the noble Baroness knows well because it has been a cause dear to her heart for many years, until we have a fully appropriate curriculum for 16 to 18 year-olds, we are not going to reach those who have not been sufficiently motivated to stay on in the past. That is why, in particular, the introduction of vocational diplomas, which starts in schools and colleges nationwide from this September, is so important. If we can establish a fully appropriate curriculum leading to worthwhile qualifications and a pathway on to both higher education and apprenticeships, I believe we will close that remaining gap in terms of participation.</p>

To assist stadium owners and management to deliver an experience for disabled supporters that is equal to that of their able-bodied counterparts, we have produced the <I>Accessible Stadia </I>guidance in consultation with the National Association of Disabled Supporters. The Minister for Sport has recently written to the Premier League and the Football League reminding them of their responsibilities in this area.</p>

I declare an interest as the vice-president of the National Association of Disabled Supporters and as one of the authors of the football task force report that recommended almost 10 years ago significant improvements in the facilities available for disabled people at football grounds. My noble friend referred to the excellent letter that the Minister for Sport has written to the football bodies, drawing attention to how much still needs to be done. What replies have been received from those two organisations, and what does he think needs to be done to ensure that the <I>Accessible Stadia </I>guidance is followed in football and other sports stadiums around the country?</p>

We should pay tribute to the improvement that has been effected over the last decade. It is reckoned that now 30,000 disabled supporters attend football grounds each weekend, and we have in Wembley Stadium not only one of the finest stadia in the world but one that is an absolute example of how to treat disabled supporters on the same basis as their more able-bodied counterparts. So we are making considerable progress, and that is also true of the planning for the Olympic Games.</p>

Unfortunately, the disability toilets available at grounds are now not suitable for such disabled people. Will he therefore use his best endeavours to ensure that stadia will install for those disabled people toilets that include a changing bench, a hoist and space, so that they can enjoy the football, or whatever other sports activity it is, just like the rest of us?</p>

It is clear that disabled supporters need all the facilities that others would want. I cannot pretend that we have 100 per cent coverage, because we are a long way off that with regard to football stadia and many other sports stadia. However, all sports are making great progress. Twickenham is an example in rugby; the Oval cricket ground and the Rose Bowl in Hampshire are also examples. As I mentioned, Wembley Stadium is an outstanding illustration of how to consider the needs of the disabled.</p>

That defence means that you must do what is reasonably practicable at the time. If the sporting bodies are not fulfilling that, will the Government ensure that in every way those bodies are dealt with as harshly as someone else who is not complying with the duty of reasonableness?</p>

<p><a name="st_39"></a>

We all recognise that there have been significant adjustments throughout society to the needs of the disabled consequent on legislation that has now been in place for more than a decade but which many noble Lords will regard as having been long overdue. Of course, one has to shift attitudes in society, but I think that on all sides we recognise that progress is being made. To give one illustration of a sporting event, the disabled marathon race is watched with at least the same degree of enthusiasm and excitement as the marathon race itself in London. That is an example of integration of the disabled into the true sporting arena.</p>

I invite my noble friend to visit our stadium, the Halliwell Jones, where he will see disability facilities second to none, where people with disabilities are not separated from their friends but can sit with them and where commentaries are available for those whose eyesight is not too good. The reason for that is that the personal adviser is not only disabled himself but a consultant on disability. Would it not be a good thing to urge people when improving disability facilities at stadiums to seek the advice of people with such knowledge of disability?</p>

Of course he is right: the Halliwell stadium in Warrington is an outstanding illustration of a stadium that caters well for the disabled. He is also right to say that others can learn from the experience of the work that has been done. It is important that sports&#146; leading bodies take the initiative on this, which is why the Minister for Sport wrote to the Premier League and the Football Association reminding them in particular of the progress that they need to continue to make.</p>

That was of course jargon for it did not have a clue about whether it was going to be weaponised or not. Do not the real questions concern whether the IAEA was involved in assessing the civil nuclear potential of this site at all, whether the Israelis had any contact with the IAEA, and what contact they had with the United States before they decided to knock it out?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08042964000087"></a>At page 23 of the third report of Session 2007-08 of the scrutiny committee in another place, the Foreign Secretary, the right honourable Mr Miliband said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000237"></a>&#147;the Charter records existing rights; it does not create a single new right. Some people would like it to create new rights, but it does not ... the Charter, in words of one or two syllables, makes absolutely clear that there is no extension of the reach of the ECJ or of any other court&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_132"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08042964000088"></a>If that is so, two questions immediately arise. The first is: why were the Community draftsmen so keen on amending the treaty to include the charter? Why have the charter if it makes no difference whatever? Let us assume for a moment that it does not make any difference. What could it possibly bring? I have long taken the view that the European institutions have consistently refused to sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights because they did not want the Court in Strasbourg to have the last word on the definition of human rights. It was almost a question of prestige. Now that the charter of fundamental rights has been established through the Lisbon treaty and is about to get legal force, the Community institutions can be much more relaxed about this matter. It comes as no surprise to see that now, at last, they are indeed prepared to become signatories to the European Council&#146;s own convention, because they believe that their court and their legal system now carry a weight as heavy as that of the European Council. That is one reason why having the charter is consistent with it having, in other respects, no legal effect whatever.</p>

<a name="80429-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08042964000089"></a>The other question that arises is: if it is true that the charter has no legal effect, why did Mr Blair, then the Prime Minister, make such a fuss about the red lines? Was he just grandstanding&#151;&#147;impossible&#148;, I am sure many noble Lords might say&#151;or does he not share the Foreign Secretary&#146;s confidence? Why did Mr Blair think that he needed the protocol?</p>

<a name="80429-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08042964000090"></a>The crucial clauses of the protocol are Articles 1.1 and 1.2, which, I remind your Lordships, read as follows. Article 1.1 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08042964000222"></a>&#147;The Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice ... or any court or tribunal ... of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or action ... of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000195"></a>Article 1.2 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08042964000223"></a>&#147;In particular, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to ... the United Kingdom except in so far as ... the United Kingdom has provided for such rights in its national law&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000196"></a>If Mr Blair is right and Mr Miliband is wrong, does the protocol put the matter beyond doubt?</p>

<a name="80429-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08042964000091"></a>Article 1.1 simply reiterates the proposition advanced by Mr Miliband in his evidence to the scrutiny committee. Indeed, in his evidence in the third report of the 2007-08 Session, Mr Miliband simply sees Article 1.1 as restating the legal position in the treaty. I apologise to your Lordships for making another quotation but I think that it is germane to the argument. He says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000238"></a>&#147;the Protocol is important because it has legal status as much as an Article, and the Protocol is absolutely clear that there can be no extended reach before the ECJ or anyone else, and that is why, in the case of working time or anything else, any judgment of the court cannot have reach into changing the laws that apply in this country ... As I say, the Charter records existing rights but there is a double-lock, because the Protocol records that the Charter shall not be used to extend the reach of the Court of Justice&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000092"></a>Curiously, Article 1.2 makes a reference only to one matter&#151;Title IV&#151;and might be said to enhance its status by comparison with other matters in the chapter.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_133"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80429-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08042964000093"></a>However, the protocol has a preamble, which would form part of the materials that the European Court of Justice will use to construe the protocol. That preamble states, inter alia, that the protocol is expressed to be without prejudice to other obligations of the United Kingdom,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000239"></a>&#147;under the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and Union law generally&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80429-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08042964000094"></a>What conclusions can we draw from all this? The first and perhaps most important one is that it is plain that, irrespective of the protocol, the charter does apply to the United Kingdom. Secondly, it is also plain that the final arbiter of just what effect it will have is the European Court of Justice. So the construction of the charter will, in the last resort, be a matter not for our own courts but for the ECJ. That is the basis of many people&#146;s concern about the likely development of law once the charter is incorporated into the Community&#146;s jurisprudential system.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80429-0003.htm"/>


<a name="80429-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08042964000095"></a>Compared with the United States Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice has had a short history that is not unlike the early history of that court. Neither the United States constitution nor the treaty of Rome contained any clause about the primacy of community law over national law, and yet within a very short time&#151;in 1803 in the case of the United States, with the famous case of Marbury v Madison; and in 1964 in the case of the European Community, in the equally well known case of Van Gend en Loos&#151;the United States Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice both declared that federal law, and European law in the case of the European Community, did indeed have primacy over domestic law.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08042964000096"></a>Although the intensification of legal integration has varied over the decades, there is no doubt whatever about in which direction the European Court of Justice is going; and although the protocol refers to rights, it does not refer to interpretation. The real concern is that the arrival of the charter will affect the way in which the European Court of Justice interprets the law that currently exists under the treaties. It will be through that mechanism that its influence shall be felt.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08042964000097"></a>The third conclusion I draw is that since the charter applies to the UK and to our courts, all our institutions will have the obligation to ensure the uniform application of European Community law. Does the protocol trump that general obligation? Mr Miliband was effectively asked that question, in a letter written to him on 11 July 2007, by the chairman of the scrutiny committee in another place. His reply of 31 July is recorded in the committee&#146;s 35th report, and I apologise to your Lordships for taking you again to the text. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08042964000224"></a>&#147;The UK-specific Protocol which the Government secured is not an &#145;opt-out&#146; from the Charter. Rather, the Protocol clarifies the effect the Charter will have in the UK. The UK Protocol confirms that nothing in the Charter extends the ability of any court to strike down UK law. In particular, the social and economic provisions of Title IV give people no greater rights than are given in UK law. Any Charter rights referring to national law and practice will have the same limitations as those rights in national law. The Protocol confirms that since the Charter creates no rights, or circumstances in which those rights can be relied upon before the courts, it does not change the status quo&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08042964000197"></a>Here the Minister omits to address the crucial problem of interpretation, which in the last resort is, as I hope I have already indicated, a matter for the European Court of Justice.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08042964000098"></a>In commenting on the right honourable gentleman&#146;s letter, the chairman of the committee very fairly pointed out that as the protocol is not an opt-out from the charter, and if the Government intended that ECJ case law based on the charter should have no effect at all within the UK, then the words in the preamble to which I drew the Committee&#146;s attention earlier, &#147;without prejudice&#148;, should have been replaced by the word &#147;notwithstanding&#148;. In other words, instead of saying &#147;without prejudice&#148; to all the other obligations that Community law brings to the United Kingdom, it ought to have said &#147;notwithstanding&#148; all these other obligations.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08042964000099"></a>The point has been developed by a number of other commentators in a slightly different context. It has, for example, been asked: &#147;What if the European Court of Justice is called on to interpret a provision in litigation taking place in another member state where that provision is identical to provisions that are already on the statute book in the United Kingdom and the court makes a decision to change the interpretation of the law in the United Kingdom?&#148;. If the protocol operates &#147;without prejudice&#148; to our general obligation to implement Community law, such a decision in another member state which is relevant to an obligation that we already have to the European Community would become the law in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08042964000100"></a>The most obvious example, to which reference was frequently made in another place, is the working time directive. There are extremely powerful provisions in the charter regarding Title IV. If a matter such as the 48-hour week is considered in another jurisdiction, it is possible, because of the way in which the preamble of the charter is drafted, that a more rigorous interpretation by the European Court of Justice of a measure that is identical to the one in the United Kingdom will change the law in the United Kingdom. </p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08042964000101"></a>An entirely distinct point relates to the second part of the protocol, which, curiously, refers not to all aspects of the charter but only to Title IV. The Committee will recall especially the words in Article 1.2. What do we make of this? Does it mean that Title IV is only one example of all the examples taken in the charter&#151;in which case, to that extent, one can be relaxed&#151;or does it mean that Title IV is singled out to get special treatment which is not accorded to the other parts of the charter? That remains unclear and I would be interested to know Minister&#146;s view.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08042964000102"></a>The Committee will be extremely relieved to know that I am coming to my concluding observations, both of which are in the form of questions to the noble Baroness. It appears that the EU institutions are at last going to sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights. However, can the noble Baroness tell us something about the timetable envisaged by the member states, and, in particular, what mechanisms are likely to be put in place to allow appeals to the European Court of Human Rights on decisions of the European Court of Justice?</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08042964000103"></a>My final observation also relates to the relationship between the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. If there is litigation in this country about a decision which involves the charter and there is a dissatisfied party who wishes to take that matter further and since the United Kingdom is already a signatory to the European convention and it is now perfectly possible through the Human Rights Act 1998 to raise convention matters in the domestic courts, what is to prevent an individual taking this matter up in litigation in this country on the grounds that the European Court of Justice had got the matter wrong and that the better view&#151;if there is already a decision, or ought to be, if there is not yet a decision&#151;is that held, or likely to be held, by the European Court of Human Rights? How does the Minister foresee these matters being handled in domestic litigation? I beg to move.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, has added his name to this group of amendments and I am delighted to see him in his place. They are designed, in one way or another, to exclude the charter and the UK protocol from the Bill and from UK law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08042964000105"></a>Eight years ago, I had the privilege of serving on Sub-Committee E of the Select Committee on the European Union, chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, when we prepared our report on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Other members included the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, my noble friend Lord Goodhart, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, and the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. What is noteworthy for this debate is that another member of the committee was the excellent noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08042964000106"></a>We had the benefit of a wide range of experience. Our report, published on 16 May 2000 as HL Paper 67, identified in paragraph 119 as one of the significant gaps needing to be filled,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000240"></a>&#147;the absence of a catalogue of fundamental rights in the Treaties&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000198"></a>We described in paragraph 121 the charter as presenting,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000241"></a>&#147;a major opportunity for giving more effective protection to the individual in relation to the activities of the institutions of the EU. Translating the principles described above into a reality which is readily recognisable to the peoples of Europe and meaningful in their daily lives is perhaps one of the greatest challenges which confronts those who have been given the task of preparing the Charter&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000199"></a>We noted in paragraph 126 that while,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000242"></a>&#147;a declaratory Charter might help to clarify the obligations of the institutions of the EU, it would not confer direct and tangible benefits on individuals&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000107"></a>In paragraph 127, we observed that the line then being adopted by the Government ran,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000243"></a>&#147;the risk of appearing to be extremely negative when it comes to the practical protection of the individual against the infringement of rights by the EU institutions&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08042964000200"></a>We identified in paragraph 128,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000244"></a>&#147;a significant gap, in that individuals in Europe are not fully protected against the misuse of power by EU institutions that breaches the ECHR. The individual&#146;s ability to challenge a measure on fundamental rights grounds is more restricted where the measure is taken by an EU institution than it is where it has been taken by a national authority&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80429-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08042964000108"></a>The adopted charter and the Lisbon treaty meet the very approach taken by the committee of which I and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, were members. I find it difficult to understand the justification for supporting amendments of this kind. Paragraph 1 of the new Article 6 of the treaty addresses the charter, which was absent from the old Article 6. It recognises the rights, freedoms and principles contained in the charter, giving them, as we had hoped, the same legal value as the treaties.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08042964000109"></a>Amendment No. 87 would keep this out of the Bill, with the 10th paragraph of the preamble to Protocol 7 on the application of the charter to Poland and the UK reaffirming that references in the charter to the operation of the specific provision of the charter are strictly without prejudice to the operation of other provisions of the charter. Amendment No. 87 would also exclude the 12th paragraph, which provides that the protocol is without prejudice to the operation of other provisions of the charter. Amendment No. 88 for good measure&#151;or bad measure&#151;would exclude recital 12, stating that the protocol is without prejudice to other obligations devolving on the UK under Union law. Amendment No. 89 would exclude specific reference to Title IV of the charter, on economic and social rights, in the UK protocol from Section 1 of the 1972 Act.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08042964000110"></a>Presumably, we legislate on the basis of evidence and informed opinion. The House has had the great benefit of three reports. One was by its Constitution Committee, which includes the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, assessing the implications for the UK constitution of the Bill and the Lisbon treaty. That was published on 28 March. Another, the report of the EU Committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Mance&#151;to which, I hope, I made some contribution&#151;giving its impact assessment on the Lisbon treaty, was published on 13 March. There was a third report by the EU Committee some eight years ago, to which I have referred and to which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and I contributed. None of those reports contains anything in the opinions of the committees of this House that in any way supports amendments of the kind now before the Committee. The Constitution Committee&#146;s report concluded in paragraph 67:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08042964000225"></a>&#147;We conclude that the change in status of the Charter from political document to having the force of a treaty would be less of a radical step than at first it may appear. This is because the Charter is declaratory of rights already recognised&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000201"></a>in the legal systems of the UK and Poland. In other words, it adds nothing new. The EU Committee report reached similar conclusions, but in this case, as any noble Lord will see, we reviewed in great detail, on the basis of evidence, each and every right and principle contained in the charter to examine its effect. We noted in paragraph 5.68 that,</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_137"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="08042964000245"></a>&#147;declaring the Charter to be legally binding will send a clear message to all institutions and citizens within the Union about the EU&#146;s commitment to uphold the rights set out in the Charter&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000202"></a>I apologise for all these quotes, but they are necessary, I think. We said in paragraph 5.80:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08042964000226"></a>&#147;Since we consider that the Charter reaffirms rights and principles which already substantially exist, albeit in many cases only at an international level, we expect the effect of the change in the Charter&#146;s status to be limited. Courts at both national and EU level will continue to refer to international treaty obligations to interpret the scope of fundamental rights and identify those fundamental principles which are general principles of EU law, whether or not the Charter becomes legally binding&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000203"></a>All this is well known to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, who, like me, has had the benefit and burden of reading some of the Luxembourg judgments on these issues. We expect that reference to the charter would, if the treaty of Lisbon comes into force, become more frequent as the charter&#146;s legally binding status would make it more straightforward for individuals to enforce rights that are guaranteed under international law. We also clarified the broad legal effect of the protocol in paragraph 5.103&#151;I will spare the Committee by not reading it now.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08042964000111"></a>During the debate in Committee on 22 April, the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean&#151;who I am now delighted to see is in his place&#151;accused Liberal Democrats of telling lies and practising deceit. The noble Lord is apparently unimpressed by Standing Order 33&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000246"></a>&#147;Asperity of speech to be avoided&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000204"></a>which was adopted by this House as recently as 13 June 1626. I hope that I shall not be found guilty of using &#147;sharp and taxing language&#148; in breach of Standing Order 33 when I say that the amendments tabled by the Conservative Front Bench, in this grouping, are manifestly ill founded and fly in the face of the painstaking work done by three authoritative committees of this House.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08042964000112"></a>I agree respectfully with the Government&#146;s legal opinions about the effect of the charter and the treaty in this context. Neither the charter nor the treaty threatens the integrity of our legal or political system in any respect. To the contrary&#151;and this point has not been dealt with yet by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&#151;we will have, enshrined in EU law for the first time, protection against the abuse of power by EU institutions. I would have thought that the Official Opposition would cheer and welcome something that will make the institutions accountable and uphold the European rule of law. It will do nothing to disturb the work of the Strasbourg court; it will clarify the relationship between the two European courts; and I have heard no specific example of any way in which it will undermine the political or legal system of this country. I therefore oppose these amendments.</p>

I do so with some trepidation, not being a lawyer myself. However, I think that the issues raised by the charter are ones on which all Members of the Committee should be allowed to comment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08042964000114"></a>Like other noble Lords, I have followed the progress of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I was on the Select Committee when the Minister, Mr Vaz, appeared  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_138"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>before us and described it as no more significant than the <I>Beano</I>. We then moved on to a different stage, where Ministers became rather alarmed about the charter and remarks about the<I> Beano</I> were dropped. If they were alarmed, they should not be surprised that some of us, to this day, retain some caution and some scepticism about what is proposed, because the Government have constantly shifted their position. The previous Prime Minister, Mr Blair, at one point declared that we had an opt-out from the Social Chapter. Then the Minister of State, Mr Murphy, told the House of Commons that we did not have an opt-out. Then the Secretary of State for Justice, Mr Straw, told the House that the Government had never wanted an opt-out.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08042964000115"></a>The Government also tried to strike down many provisions of the charter&#151;for example, those relating to children&#146;s rights. Obviously the Government themselves at one point had real concerns. The Government originally argued that they wanted the charter not to be legally binding. On 11 December 2000, the Prime Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08042964000227"></a>&#147;Our case is that it should not have legal status and we do not intend it to do so&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/12/00; col. 354.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000205"></a>Article 6(1) clearly states that the charter has legally binding status and, as my noble friend from the Front Bench emphasised, on exactly the same basis as the treaties.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08042964000116"></a>Much has been made of the point that the charter creates no new rights, but even if we accept that&#151;and I shall come to it in a minute&#151;it remains a point of anxiety that the responsibility of the European Court of Justice will be greatly increased. Until now, the court&#146;s role has been to interpret the treaties, directives and specific legislation. If the safeguards are not watertight, the ECJ&#146;s jurisdiction will be extended to other areas. The rights that are to be its concern are expressed in very general terms. That is where there is a clear risk of judge-made law expanding massively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08042964000117"></a>Of concern to non-lawyers is accountability. One of the problems with the way in which the EU works is the one-way street of so much legislation and the difficulty of reversing it, because to do so one has to achieve unanimity. If a judge in this country makes law and the Government disagree with it, they can, if they have a majority and the willingness to do so, legislate to reverse that judgment and be accountable to the electorate for what they do. A different system operates in the EU. It is extremely difficult for judge-made law then to be reversed unless it is unanimously agreed by the 27 members of the Council.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08042964000118"></a>For that reason, it is extremely important to ask whether the safeguards that the Government obtained are really watertight. Nobody could criticise the Government for lack of effort or the number of elaborate devices&#151;there are four safeguards in all. There is the protocol, particularly Title IV; there are the horizontal provisions, Title VII; there is the explanation of the origins of the rights that are included in the charter, which is, I regret, not in the Printed Paper Office; and there is Article 6 of the treaty, which explains how it

One&#146;s fear is that it may extend the competence not of the institutions but of the ECJ.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08042964000119"></a>Are all these devices effective? That the Government have resorted to no fewer than four&#151;I know that this may seem a rather unfair point&#151;and have gone to such ingenious, elaborate lengths to make the protocol watertight makes one rather doubtful of the assertion that the protocol was insignificant. My noble friend Lord Kingsland said that many academic lawyers had agreed with the opinion that the charter does not create new rights. I am certainly aware of many academic lawyers both in this country and abroad, including former commissioners and professors of law in European countries, who have doubted whether the safeguards in the legislation&#151;the protocol that the Government have obtained&#151;are watertight.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08042964000120"></a>My noble friend Lord Kingsland referred to Article 1.1 of the protocol. I do not want to read it out again, but I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to Article 1.2, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08042964000228"></a>&#147;In particular, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom except in so far as Poland and the United Kingdom has provided for such rights in the its national law&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000206"></a>This is repeated in Article 2, where the last words are,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000247"></a>&#147;to the extent that the rights or principles that it contains are recognised in the law ... of the United Kingdom&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000207"></a>So there could be a situation where the ECJ would adjudicate on rights, as long as they were expressed in UK law.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08042964000121"></a>The Government have constantly returned to the theme&#151;I am sure that we will hear it again&#151;that the charter does not create new rights. As I said, perhaps that is not the only point. Vaguely and generally defined rights may easily become justiciable in a new way by a new institution. However, is it really true that the charter creates no new rights? The Commission&#146;s website states that the treaty of Lisbon protects,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000248"></a>&#147;existing rights while introducing new ones&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000208"></a>Article 13 of the charter says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000249"></a>&#147;scientific research shall be free of constraint&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000209"></a>That looks very much like a new right. The charter&#146;s explanatory notes, which describe the origin of all the charter&#146;s rights, confirm that that right is not recorded in any other treaty to which we are a party.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08042964000122"></a>The explanatory notes also buttress the claim that there are no new rights, but some sources from which these rights are said to be derived, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, are not treaties to which the UK has been a party, although obviously not the ECHR. For example, Articles 5 and 50 are derived from the Schengen agreement. Additionally, in some people&#146;s opinions, several articles deriving from the ECHR appear to have had their scopes considerably widened.</p>

<a name="80429-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08042964000123"></a>Many other points could be made about the rights. Some seem more like welfare rights, such as the right to a free placement service, which reads rather curiously in a document of this kind. Others are extremely vague and general; for example, the respect for private

I am not aware that we have a law of privacy in this country. I know that newspapers and their editors have been extremely concerned that we might get one by the back door, which appears to be made more likely by this provision&#151;</p>

To take the example of personal privacy, we are now given protection against invasions of our personal privacy by the EU institutions, but in our domestic law, that is already covered by Article 8 of the European Convention and the Human Rights Act 1998. One cannot confuse the two. I wonder whether the noble Lord is aware of the important difference between that which protects us against EU institutions under European Union law and that which protects us against British constitutional law, in terms of the right of privacy worded in identical terms in Article 8 of the convention and in the charter.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08042964000126"></a>Another question concerns the provisions that appear to conflict with UK law. Perhaps the noble Lord will intervene on this one as well. One of the charter&#146;s provisions is that no one should be convicted for an offence of which he has already been acquitted. This point has already been raised. The Government have set about altering the rules on double jeopardy in certain cases.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08042964000127"></a>The more one looks at the charter in detail, the more one sees ways round the safeguards, which is why I begin to see why the Government have tried so hard in so many different ways with so many ingenuous devices to try to make it watertight, but I doubt whether it works. I also wonder why we need both this charter and the ECHR. One has a slight suspicion that the EU just wanted to have one as well. In the event of a conflict between the ruling of the ECJ and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which one will have priority? I imagine that it will be the ECHR.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08042964000128"></a>In speaking to Amendment No. 87, my noble friend Lord Kingsland raised the question of whether, when the ECJ makes a ruling on the charter that is justiciable in another country, that ruling will apply to this country as well, because the charter will have to be applied through its incorporation into EU law as a decision concerning another country. When that point was raised in Committee in another place, the Minister, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary&#151;admittedly she had very little time&#151;replied by making two very simple points. First, she asked whether we were not all aware that the ECJ&#146;s decisions had been binding since 1957 and, secondly, she said that the charter created no new rights. Although those answers have the merit of being simple and direct, they are not actually an answer to the question raised. There is a way in which this could have been addressed: the protocol should have said that it has effect, regardless of other treaties or EU

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08042964000129"></a>I remain deeply sceptical. I raise these questions and await the Minister&#146;s reply but, because of all my doubts, I am strongly sympathetic to the first amendment, moved by my noble friend, that the charter should be struck out.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Lamont, made only one point on which I wish to follow him because I fundamentally disagreed with everything else that he said. He raised the possibility of European Union accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. That is very much in the treaty. I have not followed the amendments through that far yet, but I would assume that Her Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition are opposing that in the same way as they oppose everything else. Just in case they are not, I hope that they will join in the appeals that are being made universally, almost, to the Russian Government to get them to ratify protocol 14, which is the fundamental requirement in the Council of Europe for the accession of the European Union to the European convention to take place. Forty-six member states have so far ratified protocol 14; only one state has not. I hope that all noble Lords want to see that take place, as it will be a protection against some of the fears that they have expressed, which will be somewhat mitigated by the fact of European Union accession and binding itself to the judgments of the European court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08042964000131"></a>To start back where the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, began, he appeared singly uncomfortable in moving his amendment. I was somewhat surprised that he had to keep going through green-backed documents to find selective quotations from the Select Committee in another place. I wondered whether that was because of the quality of the reports from the Constitution Committee and the European Union Committee in this House. Those reports were much less easy to fillet appropriate quotations from that supported his argument. The quotations were not particularly helpful and he would have done much better to stick clearly to the words in the charter and, in particular, the very clear words in the protocol on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to Poland and the United Kingdom.</p>

It records existing rights. The charter sets out a list of the rights and freedoms that people already have and enjoy as EU citizens. In conclusion, I ask my noble friend to confirm one thing when she replies so that, as a humble non-lawyer, I can see whether my understanding might have some modicum of truth. Are the Government confident that a legally binding charter preserves the legal status quo in the United Kingdom? That is a simple question, capable of a &#147;yes&#148; or &#147;no&#148; answer.

<p><a name="08042964000214"></a>Where the United Kingdom has provided for such rights, there is a justiciable issue. The court is able to rule where the UK has provided for such rights in its own law&#151;that is, the ECJ has jurisdiction over UK law. That is repeated in subsection (1) of Article 1 as well.</p>

One need say no more at this stage than that the wording is, to say the least, very curious, and it is highly doubtful whether it has the effect which the Government apparently thought that it would have. Certainly the legal adviser to the Commons Scrutiny Committee thought that it was completely ineffective to do that which the Government apparently intended. But why did the Government intend it in the first place? They could not possibly have taken the view that the charter creates no new rights because if that were the case, there would be no need for any fuss at all.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08042964000151"></a>The Government are accepting that the charter may produce new rights and that is why, if the protocol is effective, it ensures that British people get the worst of all worlds. British citizens cannot go to the European Court of Justice if they think their rights under the charter, such as their trade union rights, have been infringed. That surely follows from Article 1(2) of the protocol and Article 2. British citizens will be bound by the decisions of the court as a result of proceedings brought by citizens of other countries. Cases will be brought by the citizens of other countries, the European Court of Justice&#146;s interpretation of the charter will become part of European law and, as European law has primacy over our law, our courts will follow the European Court&#146;s ruling. That would be clear enough, even without the preamble to the protocol which stresses that this protocol is without prejudice to other obligations devolving upon Poland and the United Kingdom under the treaty on the European Union, the treaty on the functioning of the European Union and Union law generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08042964000152"></a>I cannot for the life of me see how British people should applaud the Government for introducing this protocol because if any real new rights are created as a result of the charter, the British people are, by the action of this Government, barred from benefiting from them. According to the Commons European Select Committee, the only way of ensuring that the charter does not affect UK law in any way is to make it clear that the protocol takes effect, notwithstanding the treaties or Union law in general. Finally, why have the Government not taken the advice of that Commons Select Committee? If they had, they would not be in the mess which they are now clearly in.</p>

<a name="08042964000153"></a><a name="80429-0004.htm_spnew34"></a><b><a name="80429-0004.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="08042964000357"></a>Lord Pearson of Rannoch:</b> In our previous proceedings, the noble Lord, Lord Owen, asked the very important question: what are the limits on the powers of the European Court of Justice? By way of answering that question, I shall put in your Lordships&#146; Library a brief two-page article written by the well known constitutional lawyer, Mr Martin Howe, which shows that there are in fact no limits on the power of that court and therefore no limits on the way the court will eventually interpret the Charter of Fundamental Rights. For the purposes of this debate it might be worth putting on the record a few very short quotations from the court over the years which show how the court has advanced its own powers beyond the powers conferred in the treaties.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08042964000154"></a>Mr Howe makes the very important point that the feature which sets the European treaties apart from all other international treaties is that it is a system of law which penetrates inside the member states and takes precedence over the national laws in the domestic courts of the member states. It is that internal penetration of the treaty of Rome which sets it apart.</p>
<a name="time_9"></a>
<a name="80429-0004.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="08042964000265"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08042964000155"></a>One of the key points is that the treaty articles having direct effect inside the member states are not actually stated in the treaties. This was decided by the European Court in the Van Gend en Loos case in 1963, which has already been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in his opening remarks. It is worth citing the judgment in that case. The court said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000251"></a>&#147;this Treaty is more than an agreement which merely creates mutual obligations between the contracting states.  This view is confirmed by the preamble to the Treaty which refers not only to governments but to peoples ... The Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and the subjects of which comprise not only Member States but also their nationals&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000215"></a>So in 1963, although the court is beginning to advance its jurisdiction. It does say that it is within limited fields. That will change, as we shall see.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08042964000156"></a>We then go on to the Costa v ENEL case in 1964, when the court said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08042964000233"></a>&#147;The transfer by the States from their domestic legal system to the Community legal system of the rights and obligations arising under the Treaty carries with it a permanent limitation of their sovereign rights&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000216"></a>That is what the court said; it is not in the treaty. By 1970, in the Internazionale Handelsgessellschaft case the European Court declared its view that Community  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_146"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>law should take precedence even over the constitutional laws of the member states, including basic entrenched laws guaranteeing fundamental rights.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08042964000157"></a>In 1987, in the Foto-Frost case, the court ruled that national courts had no power to question the validity of Community measures and reserved that power exclusively to itself, even though there was nothing in the treaty or in general principles of international law that would require states to recognise the validity of acts which are outside the powers conferred by the treaty. Judicial activism again.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08042964000158"></a>So the story goes on. In 1992, in the European Economic Area Agreement, the court made it clear that the objective of all the community treaties was to contribute together to make concrete progress towards European unity. It went so far as to say that the provisions of the treaty of Rome on free movement and competition, which is what that particular judgment was about, far from being an end in themselves,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000252"></a>&#147;are only a means for obtaining those objectives&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000217"></a>By now, those objectives were to be enforced in &#147;ever wider fields,&#148; no longer the limited fields that we had before.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08042964000159"></a>The story continues. In the 1998 Silhouette case, when the court dealt with trademarks and in the 1999 agrochemical case. I will not try the Committee&#146;s patience with quotations from those cases, but it all continues in the same direction.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08042964000160"></a>We come now to the recent tax cases. I asked the Minister at our last sitting whether the Lisbon treaty could lead to the harmonisation of direct tax. The treaty has been silent on direct tax, but refers to indirect tax. The answer is that the court is already there. It has already invaded corporation tax and invoked the general clauses of the treaty on non-discrimination to strike down national tax legislation. An important example is the 2002 Lankhorst-Hohorst case on tax credits on payments by a subsidiary to its parent company in a member state. I mentioned that in our previous proceedings; it denudes national treasuries of huge sums of money, although it is quite favoured by the finance directors of international companies.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08042964000161"></a>Then we come to the court setting up its own criminal areas, such as in 2005, with the environmental protection case. The court decided that the EU can specify and impose criminal offences and penalties in the very wide fields where the EC has existing competence. If that was right, the court had these powers over criminal law from the day the treaty of Rome was signed on 25 March 1957. Yet if anyone had said that in 1957, they would have been laughed at.</p>

<a name="80429-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08042964000162"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, mentioned, we saw how the opt-out from the 48-hour week, which was negotiated at Maastricht, was circumvented because the Commission said that it did not come under social policy but under health and safety at work. The court agreed and the United Kingdom lost. In our previous proceedings I read out the resultant letter from Mr Major to Mr Santer complaining about what had happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08042964000163"></a>It does not help, therefore, if noble Lords say that there is nothing new in this. The process will go on as before. The court is free to interpret the treaties in the way it wants and nothing that is put in the treaty&#151;  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_147"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>certainly nothing in the charter&#151;can be safely relied on. It will, I am afraid, be reinterpreted by the court to expand those powers ever further. I therefore support the amendment.</p>

<a name="08042964000164"></a><a name="80429-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80429-0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08042964000358"></a>Lord Campbell of Alloway:</b> Lord Denning made the point some time ago that anything that this court interpreted as within its jurisdiction&#151;and he appreciated that it had created its own jurisdiction&#151;was supranational law, to which we were subjected. This was an objective view from a great lawyer, and that is where we have got to today.</p>

I declare that interest without the overwhelming sense of guilt or shame that one or two noble Lords appear to suggest I should feel. As has just been said, it is clearly right that in some areas the European court has developed important issues and principles and has created a structure for the Community which has been long established. It did not need a political motivation to interpret the treaty in those ways. The cases which have been cited with great skill&#151;I was very happy to be reminded of them; I certainly could not have done it myself at this stage&#151;were, however, all fully in compliance with the provisions of the treaty.</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08042964000166"></a>It is inevitable that the European court will be involved in questions concerning the interpretation of the charter. This will include working out the relationships that have already been indicated between the charter and the European Convention on Human Rights and between the Luxembourg court&#151;the European Court of Justice&#151;and the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg.</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08042964000167"></a>Regarding the decisions of the court in other areas, to suggest that if it comes to interpreting the charter the European Court of Justice is bound to run amok and do dreadful things is not borne out by the history of human rights. It is quite obvious that it was the European Court of Justice which introduced into the European Community the concept of fundamental rights. I believe that that has been to the great advantage of the European Union, not only the institutions but the states and their citizens over the years. In doing so, the court moved in a very moderate way, and here I am talking about the European Convention on Human Rights and the Protection of Fundamental Rights.</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08042964000168"></a>It was not surprising that when the European Parliament and the Council of the European Community saw the way in which fundamental rights had been recognised as applying in the Community, although not specifically included in the treaties, they saw that they were necessary for the good health and working of those treaties. The European Parliament and the Council both expressed complete approval and full support for what had been done, and indicated that in the future, these fundamental rights must be regarded as part of European Community law. There was no criticism at that stage of the kind one now hears implied, that the court had got it all wrong in developing these fundamental principles. On the contrary, people accepted that what had been done was necessary and fully justified by the terms of the various treaties.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_148"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80429-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08042964000169"></a>As I have said, it is suggested that the European Court of Justice will run amok in some way, but let us look at what happened in the past when the court was developing these fundamental points, which were not expressed in the treaty and were not binding on the Community through the European Convention on Human Rights. The principles declared by the court were developed with what had been done in Strasbourg in mind. It was my experience that the court moved slowly in this regard because it was reluctant to take fundamental decisions on questions raised in cases before it where the Strasbourg court had not spoken, and where it had spoken, it was our practice to follow and apply as far as applicable in the Community the principles that Strasbourg had already laid down. I suggest that that attitude is likely to govern the approach of the European Court of Justice in dealing with fundamental rights issues in the future.</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08042964000170"></a>Finally, it was suggested some years ago that there should be a reference procedure similar to that between national courts and the Luxembourg court by which that court could refer questions on interpretation of the convention&#151;and now perhaps in the future&#151;on interpretation of the charter to the Strasbourg court. It was not adopted at the time, although it was suggested by my predecessor as Advocate-General in the court, and I do not believe that it is necessary now. But if difficulties were to arise, this could be looked at again. It may be that the Strasbourg court could be consulted in some way by the Luxembourg court in terms of the interpretation of these various rights and non-rights as set out in the charter. That may be something that should be looked at again.</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08042964000171"></a>All I suggest is that one should not be driven into a state of total fear and anxiety by the thought that the European court in Luxembourg may have, from time to time, to comment on the meaning or content of a particular fundamental right, and on the way in which it should be applied.</p>

Some noble Lords have been adumbrating the theme of the European Court of Justice running amok. But is it not fair to say that that could not happen without redress?</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08042964000173"></a>Perhaps I may give an analogy from UK history. In the trade union world, the most famous case of the past 100 to 150 years was the 1901 Taff Vale judgment which overturned what we had thought was the common law right to strike. Parliament, under the then Liberal Government, of course reversed that judgment in 1906 with the famous words about tort and no court taking action in contemplation of a trade dispute. By analogy with, let us say, competition law, if the European Court found that the existing law meant such and such but the Community institutions realised that that was not what they wanted to achieve, and if there was a wish to change the rules governing competition policy through treaty or a decision of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, then that would, ex hypothesi, be binding on the European Court of Justice. Does the noble and learned Lord believe that something along those lines would

However, the European Court decided that the regulations were a health and safety measure.

I believe that we all looked at the wording of the articles of the various treaties and gave effect to it. Giving effect to it sometimes surprised people.

However, briefly, the Court has said that the Community is moving to a state of greater unity, and if you read the treaty&#151;even the first five or six articles&#151;it is plain as a pikestaff that that is what it is required to do. The Court has on many occasions taken decisions in regard to the member states which are not popular but which have simply set out to achieve what the treaty is doing.</p>

He has been a personal friend of mine for over 50 years and I greatly respect his judicial work. What he said today, he said with immense authority. I believe that he has far more authority to speak on this subject than any other Member of your Lordships&#146; House. He has done that today to great effect.</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08042964000185"></a>As I said at Second Reading on 1 April&#151;a not entirely auspicious day&#151;I believe that giving the charter legal status will serve a useful purpose. First, it fills in a black hole in the operation of human rights law in the European Union. Unlike the member states, the European Union is not bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, because that convention does not apply to acts of the European Union or its institutions. It applies only to acts that come within the member states, and the EU is obviously not a member state. While the ECJ can take into account the general principles of human rights recognised by the member states, there has until now been no clear definition of what those rights are. The charter of fundamental rights will provide not an ideal definition but certainly a considerably better one than we have now.</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08042964000186"></a>The effect of the charter is both limited and modest. As stated in its preamble, the charter reaffirms rights and does not create them. Article 51.1 of the charter states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08042964000235"></a>&#147;The provisions of this Charter are addressed to ... the Union ... and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law&#148;;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000187"></a>while, as stated in Article 51.2, the charter</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000254"></a>&#147;does not establish any new power or task for ... the Union&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042964000188"></a>The charter does not apply to domestic law, as the European Union Committee of your Lordships&#146; House makes clear in chapter 5, paragraph 60 of its extremely valuable and useful report.</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08042964000189"></a>The charter is far narrower in scope than the ECHR or the Human Rights Act, which apply to all acts in exercise of public authority except for Parliament itself. It restricts the powers of the European Union and of its institutions. It enlarges the powers to challenge EU legislation or activities. I agree with the report of the Constitution Committee of your Lordships&#146; House that,</p>
<ul><a name="08042964000255"></a>&#147;the change in status ... from political document to having the force of a treaty would be less of a radical step than at first it may appear&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80429-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08042964000190"></a>Is the need for the charter of fundamental rights eliminated by the accession of the European Union to the ECHR? It is true that the charter and the ECHR have many similarities, and there is some risk that without a mechanism to solve this problem, the ECJ and the European Court of Human Rights may come to different interpretations of similar texts. For that  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_152"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and other reasons I would certainly welcome the accession of the EU to the ECHR, which would give the ultimate decision to the European Court of Human Rights if there was any divergence. As the report of the European Union Committee of your Lordships&#146; House says in chapter 5, paragraph 118:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08042964000236"></a>&#147;This would assist to avoid any risk of conflict between European Union law and the European Convention on Human Rights as interpreted in Strasbourg, by placing fundamental rights on a single consistent foundation throughout the EU&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80429-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08042964000191"></a>Article 1.8 of the Lisbon treaty requires the EU to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. Unfortunately, that is not quite as simple as it sounds. Such accession requires a new protocol, currently the draft protocol 14, to be ratified by all member states of the Council of Europe. The draft protocol has in fact already been ratified by all member states except for one. Unfortunately that member state is Russia, and Russia&#146;s present attitude to the West makes it uncertain whether the protocol will be ratified in the near future. Perhaps the Conservatives, whose delegates to the Council of Europe sit in the same group as the Russians, might put some pressure on their colleagues to achieve that. The fact that there could well be a significant delay in the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights certainly strengthens the case for the charter, which reaches parts that the ECHR cannot reach. I do not see the charter as a threat to the United Kingdom or to our legal system. No doubt the charter could have been better&#151;it is somewhat clumsy and sometimes long winded&#151;but it is plainly a step in the right direction.</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08042964000192"></a>The protocol on the application of the charter to the United Kingdom and Poland serves as a defence against largely imaginary threats. As the EU Committee pointed out in Chapter 5.87, the protocol is not an opt-out. I think that that is now generally accepted. It is a pleasantly short document among many long documents and states in its preamble that the charter does not create new rights or new principles. In Article 1, it states that the charter does not extend the present powers of the ECJ to rule that UK laws are inconsistent with the rights or principles of the charter. It also states, in Article 1.2, that the rights mentioned in Chapter 4 of the charter on social and economic rights are justiciable in the United Kingdom only so far as the United Kingdom has provided for justiciable rights in its own laws. It is almost certain that the social and economic rights in Chapter 4 of the charter are not justiciable in any event. However, if we are wrong on that, this protocol will prevent it. I disagree with what the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, said on that.</p>

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08042964000193"></a>The effect of Article 1.2 is to remove the binding effect in the United Kingdom of ECJ decisions on social and economic rights in relation to other countries. It is possible that the law on social and economic rights may therefore vary between the United Kingdom and/or Poland and other EU countries. What will not happen is that decisions in relation to, let us say, France would also apply to the United Kingdom if that would be contrary to the clearly expressed intention of Article 1.2. Article 2 states that, in application to the United Kingdom,

<a name="80429-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08042964000194"></a>All the protocol does is emphasise and clarify the interpretation of the charter, which is already implicit in it. That was the broad view of the EU Committee, as set out in Chapter 5.103 of its report. There is no need or justification for any of the amendments in this group.</p>

Until the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, spoke it had concentrated mainly on the ability of the European Court of Justice to decide exactly what is and is not law. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, at least mentioned the charter&#151;which it seems we are not going to discuss&#151;the details of which are very important. The last time we discussed them was when we debated the treaty of Nice, although that treaty did not incorporate them in a judicial sense. The charter deserves a very close examination because some of its effects on British law will be very severe indeed. I will not go into all of them because we are clearly spending a great deal of time on this amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, wants us to get on so I will try to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08042970000002"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, mentioned Lord Denning. As the debate has concentrated on the powers of the ECJ, it is worth referring to a speech that Lord Denning made in this House on 31 July 1986. I shall read this summary of that speech:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="08042970000083"></a>&#147;Acts of Parliament and decisions of our courts have been set aside and rendered invalid by decisions of the European Court, which is superior in all matters of EEC law not only to British Courts, including the House of Lords, but also to Parliament where their Acts past, present or future have been, can be and will be declared illegal by an overweening court sitting in a foreign capital. As we proceed with the completion of the internal market the powers and decisions of this supranational court will impinge more and more on every aspect of our national life, social, legal, political, business, labour, economic and, indeed, on our relations with countries in the rest of the world outside the EEC. Business and individuals will find themselves, unwittingly, breaking laws of which they have no knowledge and which have been made, not by their own Parliament in public, but by the institutions of the EEC meeting in private, probably after wheeling and dealing in secret&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08042970000003"></a>Those are not my words. I am not clever enough to deliver such a judgment as that, made by one of our most famous Law Lords. However, if we take his view as correct, as I am sure we will, he really put the matter in its true perspective. The European Court will eventually decide whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be justiciable in regard to this country. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, referred to a number of cases where the European Court has decided matters in spite of what Parliament felt about it and had decided. He mentioned in particular the Factortame case, which really established the superiority of the European Court because it forced a British Government to reverse an Act of Parliament which it had made to protect the livelihoods of Scottish fishermen. It reversed the decision of Parliament and of the British Government to protect their own citizens or a section of their citizenship. The result was that Spanish fishermen were allowed open access to Scottish and of course British waters and the state had to pay, I believe, between &#163;200 million

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08042970000004"></a>Before I sit down, perhaps I may read one or two quotations, if I can find them. The EU Commissioner Margot Wallström said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08042970000084"></a>&#147;The Charter will be binding for the European institutions, and also for Member States when they implement EU law, even if this will not apply to all of them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042970000073"></a>By the Government&#146;s own admission, 70 per cent of all legislation comes from Europe. Whatever they say, the charter will apply in a good many instances. Then there is the former EU justice Commissioner, Antonio Vittorino, who questioned the legal basis for the British opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights and said that it would not work.</p>

<a name="80429-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08042970000005"></a>I ask the Minister: what is the view of the European Commission? Has its view been sought? If not, why not, and will it be sought now? The Commission is an important part of this business and it would be useful to know whether it agrees that our opt-out is watertight. I very much doubt that it will. With that, I support the amendment and those that go with it.</p>

That is what will destroy Europe, and those people who wish to hasten the process of federalism and integration are actually the enemies of the European ideal because they will destroy it.

Unfortunately, it has become more and more difficult to do that, particularly as the veto has been eroded in more areas of national life. I know that the noble Lord is committed to Europe&#151;if not always to the manifesto promises on Europe that have been made by his party. However, if one has an institution that makes laws that people cannot change when they turn out to be bad laws, that institution will come into conflict and will undermine respect for the rule of law. I believe that it is part of supporting the rule of law to have institutions that are democratically accountable. My concern about this treaty, and the reason I support the amendment of my noble friend on the Front Bench, is that we may be walking into yet more areas where laws are changed in ways that do not carry consent, where Parliament is unable to intervene and voters feel frustrated. I thought that the speech made by the noble Lord gave some weight to that. Perhaps the Minister will explain how it will be different this time.</p>

He has repeated the travesty that we were given specific assurances that the Maastricht treaty opt-out meant goodbye to the working time directive. I do not accept that anybody in Brussels would agree that such specific undertakings about the effect of the Maastricht treaty were given. It confirms that the European Court of Justice was not influenced by any wider political considerations but just by the question of whether health was centrally tied up with long working hours, which it found to be the case. We should not cast any aspersions on the European Court of Justice by suggesting that it had any wider political or other motivation.

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08042970000018"></a>The noble Lord was correct on the timing of the working time directive. The point that I was making was that we had a clearly defined policy; we assured people that it was possible to deliver it, because it was subject to qualified majority voting&#151;under Article 118A, if I remember correctly, but it was a long time ago. That was then overturned, because the Commission reintroduced it as a health and safety measure, with the European Court holding that working time was a health and safety issue, thereby stretching the elastic beyond a point of breaking.</p>

<a name="80429-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08042970000019"></a>That was a highly contentious and political decision, making it a matter that required unanimity in the Community and the Commission to bring it forward. It therefore became impossible for a democratically elected Government to deliver the policy in respect of working time on which they might have been elected. That was the point that I was trying to make, if perhaps not terribly expertly. I hope that the noble Lord now understands my concern about the role of the Court.</p>

<a name="80429-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08042970000020"></a>In respect of the future, I am concerned that the Minister may be in the same boat in thinking that she has all these red lines and has secured the position, only to find that the Court will continue to behave as it has done from the beginning, which is to promote a wider and deeper Europe and stretch the elastic to breaking point. That may very well damage the European Union and the institutions to which I know the noble Lord is committed.</p>

In this debate, we have heard a number of noble Lords objecting to the idea of any foreign court having jurisdiction over British law and any limitations on the British Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08042970000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will be aware that there is a parallel debate in the United States to the one that we are having in the United Kingdom on exactly this subject. Radical defenders of sovereignty&#151;for example, Professor Alan Dershowitz at Harvard Law School, Justice Scalia on the US Supreme Court, the current Attorney-General, Alberto Gonzalez, and others &#151;take the view that it is not possible to accept international law overriding US domestic law and that the expansion of international law, conventions and institutions cannot be allowed to affect the United States.</p>

<a name="80429-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08042970000026"></a>That is much the same argument as we have been hearing from a number of noble Lords, including Members on the Conservative Front Bench, about the European Court of Justice. I would like the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, to clarify whether he shares that view. In the United States, it has led to an argument that says, &#147;We cannot accept further UN conventions, particularly those that involve such human rights issues as the protection of children&#148;. Leading on from that is the argument that the United States must reject the Geneva Convention and a whole host of other things, in defence of the sovereignty of the American constitution and the US Congress.</p>

<a name="80429-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08042970000027"></a>That is a similar argument to the one advanced by some noble Lords and which will no doubt be repeated on future amendments when we get down to the role of the ECJ in general. It would be helpful if the Conservative Front Bench would spell out whether it shares this view or has a rather more nuanced one. In a world that is increasingly globalised, we have to share sovereignty both regionally and globally.

I am not entirely surprised to find that it ranged so widely across many of the issues. I say again to noble Lords that any interventions from the Front Bench have been to be helpful in reminding ourselves how much time we have and how much more we want to discuss. I have no fears about the ability of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, to listen with great care to what is said by any of us on the Front Bench and then to make his own decision about whether he will continue to speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08042970000029"></a>When I first started to talk to noble Lords about how we might construct our debates on the EU treaty, I proposed that we try to find a way of having a big debate on the European Court of Justice, as I knew that it would figure largely in debates on a number of occasions and I wanted, as far as possible, to be able to gather the main players in that, not least the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, to inform us in our work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08042970000030"></a>I know that on the Conservative Front Bench there was a real desire, which I completely understand, to look at the issues line by line in the treaty. That is a completely reasonable way in which to approach it, but I am a little sorry that that did not allow us the opportunity to have what I would have enjoyed&#151;a much longer, more detailed debate on the European Court of Justice. Some noble Lords may blanch at the idea of a longer and more detailed debate, but it is important to have that debate, not least because of the varying views that are expressed about the Court&#146;s relevance, how it works, and the appropriateness of its judgments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08042970000031"></a>I am very grateful to those who have participated. I shall take us through the amendments and deal with the issues that noble Lords have raised. I begin where several noble Lords began, with what we want to say about the rights in the charter. I agree with those noble Lords who have assured the Committee that the rights are not new; they already bind the UK and all the member states, whenever we implement European Union law.</p>

However, I shall try to restrict myself to Members of this House or another place or to that which is contained in the documents and reports of either House. My noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith, who cannot be here today, made a speech to the British Institute of International and Comparative Law in January. Noble Lords will recall that he played a terribly important part in negotiations around the charter. I hope that we will have the opportunity at some point before we finish our deliberations on this treaty to hear from him. However, my quotation from him in a sense answers the question that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised about why we should have the charter. He said that,</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_160"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="08042970000085"></a>&#147;the Charter performs the valuable function of providing a clear, accessible statement of the rights and obligations which create limits on the EU&#146;s powers to legislate and to act. The Charter will not impose new obligations on Member States. It will not create new rights. As the Charter reflects only existing rights, the underlying rights will continue to have effect in the UK, as in all Member States, as they always have done&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80429-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08042970000033"></a>If we question the whole principle of the charter, we question those underlying rights, which the charter simply reports. Bringing existing rights together in one place makes clearer to citizens the rights that they can expect the EU institutions to respect, as member states already do when they implement EU law. The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, made that point in his contribution. In agreeing to make the charter binding, the UK insisted on a package of safeguards to provide greater legal clarity to define the scope of the obligations that a binding charter would place on the Union and the member states. These safeguards include improved charter general articles, improved explanations to the charter, an upfront reference to the charter in the Lisbon treaty and the UK-Polish protocol on the charter.</p>

<a name="80429-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08042970000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lamont, rightly talked about the journey that the UK Government have made in their concerns about the charter. Our concern was that, drafted as a political declaration, it would be insufficiently precise and detailed to be made legally binding. When we negotiated around the now dead constitutional treaty, we secured improvements to the general provisions in the charter. We also secured agreement that the courts should take due regard of a detailed commentary on the charter&#151;in other words, the explanations that identify the precise source of each charter right, a copy of which I would be very happy to give to the noble Lord, if that would be of use to him. While the Government were satisfied with the package secured in the constitutional treaty, we wanted to address continuing concerns about the effect of the charter on national law, so we also secured a legally binding protocol, making it clear how the charter is to be applied.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80429-0007.htm"/>


<a name="80429-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08042970000035"></a>There are three key safeguards to ensure that a legally binding charter simply maintains the existing legal position. There are the detailed general provisions in the charter itself, which set out the limits on how it is to be applied. These are reiterated in Article 6.2 of the treaty. There is a binding reference in Article 6.2, requiring due regard to be had to the explanations. These are also published in the charter, in the <I>Official Journal</I>. There is also a protocol to the treaty, setting out that the charter is to apply to the UK and Poland; this is not an opt-out but a legally binding guarantee as to how the charter is to be interpreted and applied. In particular, Article 1.1 in the protocol says that it does not create new justiciable rights and, under Article 1.2, charter rights that refer to national law are limited to those rights as defined in national law. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that Article 1.2 makes it particularly clear that solidarity rights&#151;Chapter 4 of the charter&#151;do not establish rights that do not exist in national law. This chapter, which also covers the right to strike, was of particular political concern. It does not in any way undermine existing rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08042970000036"></a>The charter&#146;s general articles set out and limit the scope and application of the charter. They make it clear that the charter is addressed primarily to the Union institutions and affects member states only to the extent that they implement European Union law. They also clarify that the charter does not extend the powers of the Union or give it any new power or task.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08042970000037"></a>The charter&#146;s general provisions, and the explanations, make it clear that the rights in the charter sourced from the European Convention on Human Rights and EU law must be interpreted and applied in the same way as they are in their source instruments; that is, from where they come. The charter cannot be used to extend existing rights. As noble Lords who have read them will know, the explanations also set out the difference between enforceable rights in the charter and principles, which guide the actions of the Union&#146;s institutions and the member states when implementing Union law but are justiciable only in the interpretation of such actions.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08042970000038"></a>Treaty of Lisbon Article 1.8, which replaces Article 6, will provide the key safeguards in the text of the treaties. The article provides that,</p>
<ul><a name="08042970000093"></a>&#147;the Charter shall not extend in any way the competences of the Union as defined in the Treaties&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08042970000074"></a>that the charter provisions must be interpreted in accordance with the charter&#146;s general articles and that &#147;due regard&#148; must be given to the revised charter explanations.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08042970000039"></a>In addition, as I indicated, the UK secured a legally binding protocol to the charter. The UK&#146;s position has always been that the charter sets out existing rights. It does not create any new rights and does not extend the powers of the courts. Where, as in many cases, charter rights are based on national laws and practices, they must mirror the extent and content of those national provisions. The protocol&#146;s intention therefore is simply to confirm these points for the UK&#151;to put it down in black and white for all to see.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08042970000040"></a>The protocol has the same legal force as the treaties and is very clear. No court, including the European Court of Justice, can ignore it or strike it down. It confirms that the charter does not create any greater rights than already apply in EU law and does not extend the powers of any court&#151;European or domestic&#151;to strike down UK laws. It also guarantees that, to the extent that the charter refers to national laws and practices, it applies in the UK only to the extent that the rights or principles concerned are recognised in the laws and practices of the UK.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08042970000041"></a>All these legal safeguards, including the protocol, will ensure that the charter does what it was intended to do, which is to record the existing rights, freedoms and principles that apply in the Union. As has been said, the European Union Committee report states clearly that the committee,</p>
<ul><a name="08042970000094"></a>&#147;expect the effect of the change in the charter&#146;s status to be limited&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042970000075"></a>There is no question of UK citizens having fewer rights than other EU citizens due to the UK protocol. That is because the charter creates no new enforceable rights. The existing rights and principles recorded in the charter will continue to have effect as they always have done on EU institutions and member states when implementing EU law.</p>

This is a very short point. It is not a question of striking down English law; the problem is that, given the jurisdiction of that Court&#151;for example, as regards strikes&#151;if it assumes jurisdiction and makes a decision giving health reasons or whatever, we cannot do anything about it. We cannot strike down its law. As far as we are concerned, it assumes a jurisdiction that we, as a democratic country, cannot do anything about. It is total deference, not a striking down.</p>

It is not right to say that the court can assume jurisdiction. The European Court of Justice&#146;s role is to look at and interpret how the institutions of the European Union are interpreting the law and make sure that the law in each country is relevant, appropriate and put into practice properly. The UK Government have for many years supported the role of the European Court of Justice in doing that. If you wish to make law stick across member states, it is important for there to be a legal body that can determine that that law has been put into practice properly. That has been the tradition of this country for hundreds and thousands of years. It is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08042970000051"></a>Amendment No. 89 seeks to remove the additional protection for UK social and labour laws from the UK protocol to the charter. Ensuring that the UK&#146;s labour and social legislation was protected was, and remains, a UK &#147;red line&#148;. The charter protocol guarantees that the charter cannot be used to undermine existing UK laws&#151;in particular, but not exclusively, economic and social legislation. To those who have been concerned about the potential impact of a binding charter on UK law, it is right to say that the social and labour rights in the charter have been the principal source of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08042970000052"></a>I can reassure the House that this concern is not justified, as all the social and labour provisions in Title IV of the charter are either existing rights in UK law, are tied back to national law, or are guiding principles&#151;for example, the one on placement services&#151;rather than rights. Rights cannot, therefore, be created, except in so far as they are provided for in national law. A specific reference to Title IV helps to clarify the existing position on those provisions. Perhaps I may quote my noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith from the same lecture to which I have referred. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="08042970000089"></a>&#147;As all the provisions in this Title [Title IV] are either existing rights in UK law, tied back to national law or are guiding principles, it clearly follows that they cannot create rights except in so far as they are provided for in national law.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042970000079"></a>However, he continued,</p>
<ul><a name="08042970000095"></a>&#147;sometimes, as we all know, it is necessary for reasons of clarity and reassurance to reiterate points provided for elsewhere&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042970000080"></a>So although UK social and labour laws are protected, we do not reduce the level of protection enjoyed by UK workers. I could go on, but I will not, to talk about the importance of social rights and the benefits of parental leave, European work councils and the rights for part-time workers that I believe are so essential to providing the right framework for the people in our workforce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08042970000053"></a>Amendment No. 117 aims to prevent domestic courts recognising the legal status or to take account of any proceedings in courts outside the UK based on  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_164"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the charter. Amendment No. 118 adds from the noble Lords, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Lord Willoughby de Broke, and Lord Stoddart, a further sentence&#151;namely that the word &#147;notwithstanding&#148; be added at the start. There is an intellectual legal difficulty with Amendment No. 117. It runs against, I would argue, the whole scheme of the 1972 Act, which is the mechanism by which European law is implemented in the UK, because it prevents the charter having effect.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08042970000054"></a>I am putting forward a very simple proposition. The UK is a member of the European Union and, as such, bound to implement EU law. Members of the Committee may not like that and may wish us elsewhere, but while we are a member of the European Union, we are bound to implement EU law. I think noble Lords know that we derive great benefit from that. It is right that the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that are recognised in the charter apply across the whole field, binding the Union institutions and the member states when they are implementing Union law. Accepting the amendment would mean that the courts could not take account of the charter and that the UK could not ratify the Lisbon treaty.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08042970000055"></a>Let me answer as many of the specific points as I can. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, asked whether we had consulted the Commission on the UK charter protocol. The protocol forms an integral part of the treaties&#151;primary EU law agreed by the member states&#151;and the Commission is a creature of the treaties so it does not have any free-standing right to rule on what is set out in the treaties. The only way of answering the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, is to break my own promise about not quoting people. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, will have to forgive me&#151;I will try not to do this again but I cannot think of another way of doing it. On the &#147;Today&#148; programme, Mr Barroso described what he believes to be the case on behalf of the Commission. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="08042970000090"></a>&#147;I think the deal done by Britain was very clear in keeping the role of the British courts and I think there are no dangers of revision of the conditions negotiated by Britain through ... the jurisdiction of Brussels&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042970000081"></a>That is as close as I can get to giving the noble Lord what he seeks. Bearing in mind what I have said, it would be inappropriate, at best, to formally consult a creature of the treaties about the role of the treaties.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08042970000056"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and other Members of the Committee asked about whether the European Court of Justice in Luxemburg or the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has priority. The charter does not change the position. The European Court of Justice will be able to decide how fundamental rights apply in European Union law. That is what it does now. The Court of Human Rights will have the final say about the meaning of the rights in the European Court of Human Rights. So EU law has the European Court of Justice as its final arbiter and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has the final say on human rights, as is the position now. Nothing has changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08042970000060"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked me about litigants who do not agree with what the European Court of Justice says about fundamental rights being able to open the case. They already can&#151;again, no change is suggested.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08042970000061"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Lamont and Lord Kingsland, asked what mechanisms or timetable are in place for our EU accession to the European Court of Human Rights. I take the point that was made by my noble friend and by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, about the role of Russia in the ratification in Protocol 14. Article 6(2) of the EU treaty provides for the Union to accede to the ECHR but it does not give any timetable. The protocol to the treaty says an agreement on accession must include provisions on EU participation in the ECHR control mechanisms&#151;for example, the Council of Ministers&#151;and the mechanisms that determine which member states should be involved in these cases. If someone wants to take a case to Strasbourg, who do they litigate against&#151;the EU or member states? It also says that the accession must not affect competence, and that individual derogations and reservations held by member states must not be affected. So any derogations that we have will be respected. No decision can be taken on any accession agreement until after the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty and any decision must be taken by unanimity in the Council of Europe and in the European Union. That is as much information as I am able to give on that.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08042970000062"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lamont, asked me about Article 50 in the treaty&#151;double jeopardy, or ne bis in idem in Latin. Article 50 is about the right not to be tried twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence. The European Court of Justice confirmed this right as a general principle of EC law in 2002 but a case can be reopened if new evidence appears. Article 4 of the ECHR&#146;s Protocol 7 says&#151;and UK law reflects this&#151;that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="08042970000091"></a>&#147;The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law and penal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80429-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08042970000063"></a>I shall end with another quote from my noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith. The charter I have described will ensure the charter does what it is intended to do. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="08042970000092"></a>&#147;We should put aside the hyperbole and welcome the Charter for what it is&#151;a clear, accessible statement of our rights and of the limits on the EU&#146;s powers to legislate. The Charter will not impose new obligations on Member States. It will not create new rights. The Charter instead provides a clear and valuable statement of the rights, freedoms and principles which the Union&#146;s institutions should respect&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042970000082"></a>I hope the noble Lords will withdraw their amendments.</p>

I think all noble Lords will agree it has been greatly enriched by the contribution of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn, who sat for many years as a judge in the court and who brings that unique experience to our deliberations.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08042970000065"></a>I was asked a question by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, from the Liberal Front Bench about what the Opposition&#146;s policy is towards the European Court of Justice generally and the issue of sovereignty in particular. He may be disappointed to know that although the Opposition Front Bench has many robust policies on a wide range of political matters, it has not yet got a policy on sovereignty and the powers of the European Court of Justice. However, in a personal capacity, I will try and respond, telegraphically, to his question.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08042970000066"></a>It is important not to confuse two concepts of sovereignty. One concept of sovereignty&#151;a concept in public international law&#151;is about the relationship between one nation state and another. Year in, year out, the United Kingdom signs many international treaties and almost invariably the consequence of the signature and subsequent ratification of an international treaty is some constraint on the sovereignty of the British state to operate internationally. A very good example is the recent convention on torture. I cannot imagine that anybody of any political party would wish to remove that power from a nation state in international society. There, I think, there would be no difference between myself and the noble Lord, Lord Wallace.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08042970000067"></a>However, the issue of sovereignty that this debate raises is not the issue in public international law but the issue in domestic constitutional law, which is an entirely separate concern. Here, the point has been well made by several noble Lords from whatever point of the political compass they have been travelling. Of course, when we joined the European Community, the great cases of Van Gend en Loos, Costa and ENEL were already decided. Before we entered the Community in 1972, it was clear that European Community law had the last word on matters that fell within the terms of the treaty. The concern that has grown during the past 20 years is the scope and outreach, as the Americans say, of the powers exercisable under the treaty. It is not the principle, it is the scale that has provided the problem.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08042970000068"></a>My noble friend Lord Forsyth got to the root of that problem. The Community has been extremely successful in developing the rule of law; it has been extremely weak in developing a parallel concept of democracy. The speed with which the rule of law has travelled over a wider and wider range of issues and the failure of democracy to keep up with it is the fundamental weakness of the Community. As my noble friend and many other noble Lords have said, once a law is on the statute book in the European Community, it is almost impossible to reverse it&#151;unlike the situation domestically where, if one does not like a decision of the Appellate Committee of your Lordships' House, the new Parliament can change the law and reverse it. That is almost impossible, and certainly

That is why there is so much concern about the charter and whether the protocol is really watertight.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08042970000069"></a>I heard what the noble Baroness said about the efforts of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, and I salute those efforts; but I cannot help thinking that he would have been much better instructed by the Government to use his energies to get the Community to adhere to the European Convention on Human Rights rather than to invent an entirely new Charter of Fundamental Rights which, in my view, is otiose.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08042970000070"></a>I think that it is clear&#151;I certainly accept&#151;that the charter does not create new rights or new competencies. I am also convinced that it cannot be used to expand existing rights; but those are not the problems that our amendments raise. They raise the problem that there is nothing to prevent a new interpretation of existing rights in the context of the charter which had their origin in the European Community changing the effect of existing law in this country. That is our concern. I am not yet convinced from what I have heard from the noble Baroness that the Government have got the wording of the protocol right. That is precisely why we have tabled our amendments.</p>

<a name="80429-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08042970000071"></a>I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for her reply. It did not convince me. I shall take the amendments away and reconsider the matter, but she can be confident that I am likely to return to them on Report. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p>

I hope that in this debate we will focus on the budgetary affairs and the new procedures, which have been outlined, and examine how they could improve or make more complicated the structure within which the European Union will operate.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08042976000003"></a>Noble Lords will know that the budgetary affairs of the European Union are a source of considerable concern to the people of this country, to the Government, I know, to many of us and to the European Union's own Court of Auditors. In November last year, the European Court of Auditors refused to sign off the EU's annual accounts for the 13th year in a row. It found that material errors had affected between 60 and 85 per cent of the European Union&#146;s entire budget for 2006.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_168"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80429-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08042976000004"></a>Aside from the apparently deep-seated problems of mismanagement and alleged fraud in the budget's implementation, there is also the whole question of the misallocation of resources. The common agricultural policy still represents about 40 per cent of all European Union expenditure. Despite all the talk of reform, the specific elements of the CAP that can distort market conditions continue to represent about a third of all European Union expenditure. The Government themselves and many Members of the European Parliament participating in this debate have always made it clear that EU spending needs real and fundamental reform. Of course it does, but how best should we proceed? Despite all the talk of reform, we do not appear to have made the progress that many of us had hoped for.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08042976000005"></a>In <I>Global Europe</I>, which was published last October and which bore the signatures of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, they said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="08042976000082"></a>&#147;The current EU budget does not equip the EU to meet the challenges of globalisation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042976000077"></a>They continued,</p>
<ul><a name="08042976000086"></a>&#147;it is essential that resources are used more effectively ... We must recognise the limits to EU budgetary intervention. Expenditure is just one of a number of policy levers, alongside coordination, sharing best practice, and legislation or regulation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042976000078"></a>They reminded us:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08042976000083"></a>&#147;The CAP remains the most visible and expensive common policy of the EU, but it distorts the Single Market, hampers innovation, and is increasingly out of step with the need for Europe to respond to the challenges of globalisation. Internationally, it continues to attract criticism, creates tensions in the EU&#146;s relations with trading partners, and imposes significant costs on developing countries. Domestically, it imposes substantial costs on consumers and taxpayers and is inefficient in delivering support to farmers and promoting an attractive rural environment. Indeed&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042976000079"></a>the Government concluded,</p>
<ul><a name="08042976000087"></a>&#147;much of the CAP still has a negative impact on the environment&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80429-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08042976000006"></a>So we have heard all those ambitions of the Government. They want to change the European Union budget so that it is fit for the 21st century. They want to restructure the budget so that less is spent subsidising agricultural production and more is spent on scientific and technological research and development. The Government also always stress that they want to ensure financial discipline in the use of money under the EU budget.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08042976000007"></a>Against that background, perhaps we can pause for a moment and judge what the Government are presenting to us. It is difficult to understand why the Government have agreed to a measure, which we are being asked to ratify, that transfers so much control over the European budget away from the Council of Ministers to the European Parliament. In this treaty they are also presenting us with a complicated structure that I do not think will produce the financial discipline that we all seek. That is why I am moving this amendment. It seeks to exclude from ratification the new overarching provisions of the Lisbon treaty that refer to the European Parliament&#146;s budgetary power.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08042976000008"></a>The biggest change to specific budgetary procedures comes in the replacement Article 272 in what is currently called the Treaty establishing the European Community but which will be known as the Treaty on the functioning  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_169"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the European Union if the Lisbon treaty enters into force. This deals with the procedure for drafting and adopting the annual EU budget. Let us remind ourselves of the existing procedure, which many of us find rather unsatisfactory. The current Treaty establishing the European Community makes a distinction between EU expenditure that is defined as compulsory under the EU treaties and expenditure that is not compulsory. Non-compulsory expenditure represents around 60 per cent of the total EU budget and compulsory expenditure around 40 per cent. Compulsory expenditure is effectively the common agricultural policy. Non-compulsory expenditure is just about anything that is not agriculture.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08042976000009"></a>Under the current Article 272, the European Parliament can propose what the treaty calls &#147;modifications&#148; to expenditure that is defined as compulsory under the treaties. On the other hand, it can propose what the article calls &#147;amendments&#148; to expenditure that is defined as non-compulsory. The Council can reject the European Parliament&#146;s modifications to compulsory expenditure and the European Parliament cannot reinstate them when the revised budget is sent back from the Council to the Parliament for final adoption. On the other hand, acting by a majority of its component members and three-fifths of the votes cast, the European Parliament can overturn alterations to amendments the Parliament wanted in areas of non-compulsory expenditure. The EU budget is then finally adopted.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08042976000010"></a>In other words, at present the European Parliament has the final say over non-compulsory expenditure whereas the Council has the final say over compulsory expenditure. However, under Article 272, the European Parliament does have the power to veto the entire budget and ask the Commission to restart the whole process from scratch with a new proposed budget, exercising what has come to be called the nuclear option.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08042976000011"></a>What do the Government find wrong with this existing procedure? Under the new provisions we will move to replacement Article 272, where there is no distinction at all made between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure in the EU budget. The European Parliament will therefore be able to propose amendments to anything in the budget, including to what used to be called compulsory expenditure, which means the common agricultural policy. If the Council does not agree in the first instance on the European Parliament&#146;s amendments there is then formed something called a conciliation committee. In this committee the Council and representatives of the European Parliament have to agree a joint text of the budget. If they do not, the whole budget falls and the Commission must then present another draft budget. Both institutions, therefore, get a new power to block amendments to areas of the budget that they do not have the final say on in the current treaty. The Council is able to block amendments that the Parliament wants in relation to non-compulsory expenditure and the Parliament is now able to block changes that the Council wants over compulsory expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08042976000012"></a>All else being equal, I thought at first sight that this would seem to be a better deal for the Council as currently non-compulsory expenditure is a greater share of the overall budget. However, the new budget

The representatives of the European Parliament in the conciliation committee act by a simple majority. This is in contrast to the current treaty provisions under which the European Parliament has to vote by a majority of all its members and three-fifths of the votes cast to overturn Council changes to the Parliament&#146;s amendments to non-compulsory expenditure. Therefore the Lisbon treaty makes it easier for the Parliament to block Council wishes in what would now be termed non-compulsory expenditure. By contrast, under the current treaty, the council votes by qualified majority voting to overturn European Parliament changes to compulsory expenditure. Under the Lisbon treaty&#146;s new provisions, it continues to vote by QMV in the conciliation committee.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08042976000013"></a>My conclusion, therefore, is that the Lisbon treaty does not make it easier for the Council to overturn the European Parliament. The Lisbon treaty&#146;s procedure following the conciliation committee is also very significant. If the representatives of the European Parliament and the Council reach agreement in the conciliation committee, their budget agreement still has to be approved by the respective full institutions. It is here that the Lisbon treaty&#146;s empowerment of the European Parliament in relation to the Council is at its most apparent. If the European Parliament rejects the budget, acting by a majority of its component members, the whole budget falls and the process has to start again from scratch. This is equivalent to the nuclear option the European Parliament currently has under Article 272.8 of the TEC.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08042976000014"></a>The Lisbon treaty makes it easier for the European Parliament to exercise this power. This is because the current treaty says the Parliament has to command the majority of its component members and three-fifths of the votes cast to invoke this veto. The Lisbon treaty&#146;s replacement article requires the Parliament to vote only by a majority of its component members. On the other hand, if the Council rejects the budget but the European Parliament approves it, the budget will be finally adopted on the basis of the joint budget produced by the conciliation committee. On top of this, however, if the European Parliament votes by a majority of its component members and three-fifths of the votes cast, it can insert any of the amendments to any part of the budget it made prior to the conciliation committee.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08042976000015"></a>In summary, if the European Parliament and the Council ultimately disagree on the budget and the Council does not wish the budget to be adopted, the Lisbon treaty allows the European Parliament to assert its preferences over the entire budget, which will then be adopted. Under the current treaty Parliament can finally overrule the Council only in areas of non-compulsory expenditure, which does not include the CAP. So the Lisbon treaty also makes it easier as well for the European Parliament to veto the entire budget, frustrating the wishes of the Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08042976000016"></a>So where are we? I think that we are facing what will undoubtedly become a much bigger European Union budget overall. As the history of European  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_171"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Parliament decisions shows, it tends to be the biggest spender of all the EU institutions, and typically it does its best to reverse limitations on spending introduced by the Council. One has only to look at the process for drawing up the 2008 budget, where the European Parliament sought a total EU budget that was much higher than the Council&#146;s draft budget. Indeed, the Parliament budget was even higher than the Commission&#146;s original proposal.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08042976000017"></a>One effect of all this, on which I would very much welcome the Minister&#146;s comments, is that we may now see a continued over-allocation of resources to the common agricultural policy, expenditure which the Council can currently control, but no longer if these changes go through. By way of example, in the drafting of the 2008 budget, when it came to the heading largely comprising the common agricultural policy, the Council sought a total expenditure of &#8364;36.542 billion, whereas the European Parliament sought &#8364;36.995 billion, an increase of &#8364;453 million. I worry, therefore, that the other detailed changes which the Lisbon treaty makes will, in the Government&#146;s own words, erode financial discipline in the arena of a much bigger EU budget.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08042976000018"></a>The Council currently adopts the EU financial regulations that set out how the EU budget will be implemented and the accounts presented and audited, and decides the procedure for adopting rules governing checks on those overseeing the budget&#146;s implementation, with consultation only by the European Parliament. However, under the Lisbon treaty the adoption of these rules will move to co-decision, giving the European Parliament the power to veto the Council&#146;s wishes. When the same changes were proposed at the time of the earlier negotiations the Government opposed them. They said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08042976000084"></a>&#147;The UK does not support extension of co-decision to these articles in which Council control is fundamental to maintaining budget discipline&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80429-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08042976000019"></a>We need to know from the Government what has changed. What has given rise to this recommendation in this treaty? As I understand it, David Miliband, the then Secretary of State at Defra, and Paolo di Castro, the Italian agriculture Minister, signed a joint communiqu&#233; on 19 March last year on the Italian and British shared position on the future of the European agricultural policy, and soon afterwards David Miliband suggested that his recent discussions had indicated that the UK agenda for CAP reform had &#147;growing support&#148;. It is really hard to understand how that can possibly be true with these Lisbon treaty changes. They will make it more difficult for the UK to address the clear and serious problems of the EU budget. Indeed, I think it will be much harder to tackle those concerns, and that is why I beg to move.</p>

The European Parliament has had powers over the setting of the budget for many years, and I am one of those who believe that the changes proposed are an improvement. Part of the problem in the past has been that agriculture expenditure is too high. It has been under the control of the Council, and over many years agriculture Ministers have determined a very large part of that expenditure. In the amended system, they will not be able to do that on their own. I think that that is very satisfactory.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08042976000021"></a>The budgetary role of the Parliament is only part of the steady increase in the democratically elected Parliament&#146;s control of legislation and the budget over many years. Originally it was largely advisory, and the role in setting the budget, as the noble Lord pointed out, was strictly limited by the exclusion of the so-called obligatory expenditure, principally on agriculture and largely out of the control of the European Parliament. In earlier treaties the European Parliament increased its responsibility as co-decider on legislation over a much wider range of matters. I would say that those changes have now been largely completed, and if the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified, almost all legislation and the budget will be decided jointly by the elected representatives of the people in the Parliament and the representatives of the member states in the Council. Over a period of time that is likely to lead to a greater sense of financial discipline and the allocation of resources in a better way.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08042976000022"></a>In my view, for democratic reasons it is surely right to support the change in the decision-making procedure on the EU budget, and it is worth noting that when the Ministers controlled it, we all said that expenditure on agriculture was far too high. That will be changed by a change in procedure. While we know that agriculture takes over 40 per cent of the budget, I would like to stress that the figure does not really paint a complete picture of the budget of the European Union as part of the total public expenditure of the member states in their national budgets. The figures are striking and I think that they should be brought out. Certainly for the past 20 years, the European Union budget, which we are discussing in this amendment, has represented about 2 per cent of the public expenditure of the member states of the Union. The published figure for 2006 showed that the EU budget represented 2.1 per cent of member states&#146; general government expenditure, the remaining 97.9 per cent being spent by member states on education, health, welfare, defence and the many other elements of public expenditure that we know all about.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08042976000023"></a>In the Lisbon treaty, as I said earlier, the European Parliament will take over responsibility jointly with the member states and the Council for European Union agricultural expenditure. This is important and I think it is an improvement, but I would like to make it clear that what we are talking about represents only around 1 per cent of member states&#146; total public expenditure. I do not think that we should delete from the Bill, as proposed in this amendment, the budgetary responsibilities of the European Parliament.</p>

I think that we can listen with similar admiration to the views that have just been expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton. In his own personal experience, he has observed the process of budget making at close quarters, and I am bound to say that I prefer his judgment that it is more likely that agricultural expenditure will be brought under control with the new proposed disposition than that which has relied on the judgment of the Council of Ministers.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08042976000025"></a>Indeed, it is strange to hear the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, suggest that a movement towards greater democracy, in giving the European Parliament more parity of influence in both compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, is unwelcome. That is particularly strange, having heard the speeches made on the previous amendment in which we were assured that what was being criticised was not the excessive law making of the European Court of Justice, so much as the inability of the European Union to amend its decision-making procedures in a more effective, democratic way. I want only to make the general point that co-decision making over all budgetary expenditure seems to me both logically sensible and democratically more accountable than the present arrangements and, if one looks at the representation of districts in the European Parliament, clearly alters the balance very considerably in a direction which is not likely to lead to greater looseness of control over other expenditure. </p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08042976000026"></a>The very fact, as the noble Lord, Lord Willamson, said, that this is such a tiny proportion of public expenditure makes it imperative and very much in the interests of the European Parliament that control is exercised in a way that renders expenditure effective, targeted and visible. That is what will result from these beneficial amendments.</p>

I can certainly understand why he makes the detailed arguments but I cannot follow him in that particular argument. I should just like to pursue it for a moment.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08042976000028"></a>At present, as the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, highlighted on the basis of his very great experience, the European Union budget is around about 2 per cent of total public expenditure of the member states of the European Union. Sometimes it is a little less than 2 per cent, sometimes it is a little more, and it has been thus for decades. That budget is also equivalent&#151;or has been for most of the past several decades&#151;to about 1.15 per cent of the total gross national product of all the member states. It is actually slightly lower than that now as a consequence of the last budgetary exercise undertaken by the Council in 2004 and concluded under the British presidency. Eighty-five per cent of the budget&#151;again a decades-old figure which is still valid&#151;is spent in the member states. Indeed, most of it never leaves the member states and is obviously a book transaction in any case. That is entirely how it should be.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08042976000029"></a>The fact of the matter is that in the reform treaty, despite the alterations to which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, drew attention in decisions about the allocation  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_174"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the budget, the total of the budget remains in the hands of the member states in the Council. There is no power on earth&#151;other than by the decision of those member states in the Council&#151;that can produce an increase in the total of the budget. I find it very interesting that within that total there will be a new dynamic that involves the Parliament in decisions relating to so-called compulsory expenditure, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said, is overwhelmingly the common agricultural policy.</p>

<a name="80429-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08042976000030"></a>Having discussed these matters with European parliamentarians and Westminster parliamentarians for many years, I take the view, as the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, does, that the CAP budget will be a great deal more liable to amendment, reduction and re-orientation, because of the introduction of authority from the elected Parliament, than previously, despite the reforms that have taken place, when it has been the sole property of the Council and the agriculture ministers. Part of the impetus in the Parliament to make changes in the CAP and the common agricultural fund will come from the fact that it shares the view&#151;it is certainly a majority view in this House and in comparable Parliaments elsewhere in the European Union&#151;that too great a proportion of the total budget is still going to particular forms of agriculture support. That will produce a pressure on the CAP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08042976000031"></a>Secondly, there are, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, rightly said, other ambitions for different priorities within the Parliament. There is a strong view&#151;this has been the case for several years&#151;that Community expenditure on research and development, consistent with the ambitions of the Lisbon strategy of 2000, should be much bigger. The budgetary exercise in 2004 cut to &#8364;19 billion the proposed &#8364;31 billion budget over the seven years of the current budgetary period proposed by the Commission. I did not think that that was a sensible direction in which to move in circumstances in which we are repeatedly told that the greatest source of effective competitiveness in the globalised economy is knowledge, scientific and technological prowess, and innovation. I simply think that that is worth investing in. The will of the Council, rightly representative of the elected governments, prevailed and democratically that is how it should be, however much I regretted the outcome.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08042976000032"></a>In the Parliament, that kind of ambition will be reflected. There will be an ambition to strengthen the commitment in the European budget to emergency aid, but, more particularly, to systematic long-term support for development in the Third World. There will be arguments over that too. I do not anticipate a huge increase in that area, but it certainly will be an alternative presented against the current level of agriculture spending as a proportion of the budget.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08042976000033"></a>Those tensions are healthy, democratic tensions. Those pressures are democratic pressures that really do reflect the changing priorities of modern Europe, including this country. I do not think there would be anything remotely like majority support for maintaining even the level of spending as a proportion of budget that has been reduced, that still goes on the common agricultural policy. It is to the credit of the member

There would be a stronger mandate even for spending 40 per cent of the budget on agriculture, broadly defined, if a larger proportion of that 40 per cent was going to rural development so that communities were provided with alternatives and attractions to encourage young people to stay in the rural areas. I do not think there would be a terrific argument about that. However, that, too, is one of the arguments that will now be heard in consideration of the European Union budget to the degree that it was not heard outside the Commission or in the Council in past years.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08042976000034"></a>I think that we are observing a healthy development in two respects. First, no change is implied in the total of the European Union budget, because I foresee no substantial change of will in the member states to bring about an increase in the total&#151;certainly not one of any significance. Secondly, there will be a new source of argument about the priorities to be pursued with the money available in the European Union budget over a budgetary period. As the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, said, it will deprive the agriculture Ministers, with particular constituencies and priorities to serve over the decades, of a monopoly in conclusive decision-making on the way in which the budget for agriculture is spent. That budget still takes up a substantial part of the budget of the European Union.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08042976000035"></a>Legitimate though his arguments are in a parliamentary context, I hope that in the detail the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will seek an opportunity to withdraw the claim that the consequence of the changes in the Lisbon treaty will be that the budget will be bigger. That will not be the case. Indeed, I believe that the changes will bring about a better, more accountable and more democratic form of decision-making because it will be a new method of shared decision-making between elected parliamentarians and elected Governments. That will be an advance for the European Union and the people who pay for it&#151;the taxpayers.</p>

I am personally extremely grateful, as I am sure these Benches will be.

He is right to say that the system will persist for a few more years before the changes come about but it sounded like living in the past. I apologise for repeating a point that was made last week by me and perhaps by others but this issue comes back to the nature of the origin of the amendment, which I think was Amendment No. 89 on page 563 of the House of Commons Marshalled List, probably of 3 February, if my memory of the numbers and date is correct. However, on that occasion, it was put forward not by Mr William Cash and Mr David Heathcoat-Amory but by Mr William Cash and Mr John Redwood. Presumably, in anticipation that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, would be introducing this amendment today, the media sources in Vulcan&#151;they have prescience and foresight there, which we do not yet have electronically in Great Britain or our universe&#151;have been sending him the explanation of the budgetary system which will be replaced. I strongly agree with the assertion of the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, that there is no way in which the belief of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that the budget will automatically grow too big beyond the existing level can be proven just by the change in this mechanism.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08042976000038"></a>I regret very much that a person who has honourably described himself as a European enthusiast&#151;I accept his explanation&#151;would seek to put a spanner in the works with this amendment. That is why I hope that it will not be pressed and that he will withdraw it at the end of this debate. It is a spanner in the works of a modernisation of the budgetary system which has been extensively worked on, fought for and struggled for over recent years both by Members of the European Parliament and&#151;strangely, because it may seem as though there is a conflict of interests&#151;by members of the Council of Ministers of the various member states. They see the need for modernisation and for the abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08042976000039"></a>This European budget remains a minuscule proportion of the total public, central government and other expenditure in all the member states. It is of the order of 1.5 per cent of total public spending, as was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson. That is a tiny proportion. It remains a virtuous system in the sense that its receipts automatically equal its payments. That is particularly the case given that the UK now has an uncomfortably large budget deficit&#151;the Conservative Benches in the Commons suggest that historically it is one of the biggest deficits ever. How many member states will be in that position? The answer is: not many. A while back, that was regarded as a virtue for member Governments&#151;or individual national Governments before the European Community was created.</p>

That is precisely why this mechanism is being modernised under the proposals of the treaty. Therefore, it seems a shame that, once again, the Conservatives are not bringing us all up to date on what the Conservative Party in the Lords really feels about the European Union, our

It is a modest modernising treaty if ever I saw one&#151;it is totally different from the old constitutional proposals&#151;and the budget is a good example of that. The Conservatives are stuck in a groove, reflecting the other place, with the much deeper hostility towards Europe that is always encountered there.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08042976000041"></a>Subject to further arguments in this debate, surely we must back the Government in the proposal to support new Article 9A in the Lisbon treaty in order to bring about greater involvement by the European Parliament. The need for a health check for the CAP would coincide with that process. That would be mainly a Council of Ministers function and the European Parliament would react to it rather than being a prime mover. That is right because this will be a decision between sovereign member Governments. Personally, I do not believe that the French Government will be as difficult as some of the British newspapers suggest. They see the reality of the changes in the agricultural world, even in France. No one can criticise France, where the agricultural population has now fallen to 3 per cent; after the war, it was traditionally 25 per cent but many farms in France have closed down. The French see the logic of the modern system of the single farm payment, providing for the resuscitation of the environment and all sorts of other activities linked to farming. The end to production subsidies will come about quite soon&#151;over the next few years&#151;and, instead, there will be support for environmental and agricultural modernisation and investment. That must be the way forward. The elected representatives of the European Parliament, as well as the national MPs of all the national parliaments, will work together to achieve that objective. They will work with the Governments rather than follow the old-fashioned system that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, seems to think should carry on for ever.</p>

I assure the Committee that I shall intervene very rarely in the Committee and other stages of the Bill, and I hope that I stick by that. The report of your Lordships&#146; Select Committee seems to be something of a Cinderella in the debate. By consensus, we reached some conclusions which I think the Committee may want to recall. If I may, I shall mention one in particular, and I do so in no partisan spirit&#151;I am neither for nor against the amendment. I am simply recalling what the all-party committee agreed by consensus as a conclusion on the question of the European Parliament being part of the co-decision procedure on compulsory expenditure&#151;in particular, in relation to the common agricultural policy. Therefore, perhaps your Lordships will forgive me if I quote from paragraph 10.39 on page 230 of our report, which I hope will be helpful to the Committee:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="08042976000085"></a>&#147;The future policy impact of the move to co-decision is not clear. Much depends on the European Parliament itself, but the weight of the evidence suggests that the agriculture and fisheries committees of the European Parliament will in future represent, and be closely overseen by, a wider range of interests than the narrow producer interests that have historically dominated those committees. For these reasons, we expect that the change is likely to assist rather than impede further reform of both the common agricultural and fisheries policies&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08042976000080"></a>That was a consensus conclusion.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08042976000048"></a>That canard is closely associated with that other line that we generally get from Europhiles, which is that there is really nothing much to worry about with the European Union because there are only 30,000, or 40,000, or perhaps 60,000 civil servants employed in Brussels&#151;fewer than the Scottish Office used to have. Of course, the answer to that is that those 30,000, or 40,000, or 60,000 civil servants, whose number is difficult to discern accurately, make the law supported in the Council that is then executed by the civil services in all the member nations, which control the democracies of hundreds of millions of people. I hope that we will not get too much more of that in these debates.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08042976000049"></a>On the amendment itself, it is of course good that the European Parliament will now have more control over the budget, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, explained. Well, it would be good if the European Parliament were actually going to use its new powers. The basic point here is that no European institution&#151;not the Parliament, the Commission or the Court&#151;wants to halt, inconvenience or hold up the gravy train that is the European Union.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08042976000050"></a>We have the clearest possible demonstration of that in the story of Marta Andreasen, who, as your Lordships may know, is now treasurer of the UK Independence Party. Mrs Andreasen was the first qualified accountant ever to be appointed to the position of chief financial officer in the European Union and, under the treaties, the chief financial officer had the power to control and be responsible for the budget. What happened? When she refused to sign off the first set of accounts that were put in front of her, she was first suspended and eventually dismissed. She is now appealing, so I do not want to say much more about her case, except that the first stage of that appeal&#151;at some form of staff court in Brussels&#151;found entirely against her and merely parroted the Commission&#146;s position. There is no hope, then, of reform coming in this area from the European Union institutions.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08042976000051"></a>As other noble Lords have mentioned, the accounts have not been signed off for 13 years. I remind the Committee that that process has been undertaken by the EU&#146;s internal auditors; this is an organisation whose internal auditors have refused to sign off its

If that happened anywhere else in the normal world, the directors would have been locked up at least 10 years ago, so I have a proposal that I hope that the Government will take seriously. I am sure that they will put this to the appropriate channels in Brussels. It is, quite simply, that the Court of Auditors should be abolished and a leading firm of international accountants appointed in its place, for perhaps five years. That leading firm should be selected by the donor nations to the EU&#146;s profligate coffers.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08042976000052"></a>In other words, the countries that produce the money for that absurd circus should be the ones to select a major firm of international auditors to get inside Brussels and see what is happening. Then the taxpayer might begin to get better value from this project and a greater understanding of it&#151;and thus a greater determination to leave it. I would be grateful to know what the Government think of that considered suggestion.</p>

<a name="08042976000053"></a><a name="80429-0009.htm_spnew15"></a><b><a name="80429-0009.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="08042976000104"></a>Lord Hannay of Chiswick:</b> It is always a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. I enjoyed him getting his canards in a twist just now; I am glad that he sorted them out eventually. However, on this issue, I was rather astonished to see this amendment proposed on the Marshalled List. I wondered why on earth those who oppose this Bill and treaty were looking a gift horse in the mouth. I understand a bit better now; I suppose that the real answer is that the red flag of more influence for the European Parliament had gone up and was considered to be a conversation stopper.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08042976000054"></a>Through all my experience of the European Union, which has covered quite a few years, British Governments and Members of the European Parliament have railed against the distinction between obligatory and non-obligatory expenditure. Now that that is about to be abolished, they discover that they wish that they had had more of it. I honestly do not think that wise.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08042976000055"></a>The introduction by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, was subtle and careful, as usual, but he did not mention a couple of fairly germane points. First, what he called the nuclear option brings about something that could bring everyone to their senses if it ever had to be used, as the European Union would go on to what are called provisional twelfths. That is to say, it would have to spend per month what was available the year before. That is a conservative measure, so we should not feel worried by the possibility that it might arise in circumstances where one or another institution was going too far.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08042976000056"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord did not mention something rather important on the European Parliament&#151;and although I do not wish to get into it, the proportion of gross national income covered by the European budget is a genuine issue. It is that the European Parliament, in so far as it gets more influence on the obligatory spending&#151;when that becomes obligatory no longer&#151;will still be totally constrained by the financial perspectives for the next six years and thereafter. These are agreed by inter-institutional agreement between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The flexibility given in all this will be pretty modest, so the amount of risk in giving the Parliament more say on the matter is pretty small.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08042976000057"></a>I will not stand here and argue that it is a sure, done deal that the Parliament will actually use its powers on every occasion as we would wish, but the words of wisdom from the European Union Select Committee should be considered rather carefully. The balance has shifted in the parliamentary committees and I hope very much that this amendment will not, on reflection, be agreed.</p>

<a name="08042976000058"></a><a name="80429-0009.htm_spnew17"></a><b><a name="80429-0009.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="08042976000105"></a>Lord Tugendhat:</b> Over 20 years ago, I was the commissioner in charge of the budget. Of course, much has changed in the mean time and my recollections are, no doubt, out of date. However, I would like to cover some of the same ground as the noble Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Williamson, both of whom I had the pleasure of working with when I was a commissioner. They were then British civil servants.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08042976000059"></a>First, I agree very much with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, about what my noble friend Lord Hunt called the nuclear option. It is far from that; the budget was indeed rejected one year when I was the budget commissioner and everything went along smoothly thereafter on the one-twelfth system&#151;a very effective way of curbing public expenditure. I am not suggesting that it should be used very often but, far from laying waste to the budget, it enables controls to be exerted.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08042976000060"></a>I agree with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, that the European budget should be seen not in isolation but as a part of the totality of public expenditure within the European Union&#151;as part of the totality of what is spent at the Union level and what is spent at the national level. In my opinion and the opinion of many noble Lords, rather more is still spent on agriculture than is justifiable but, as the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, said, we are talking about something like 1 per cent, which helps to put it into context.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08042976000061"></a>I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch&#151;I rarely do on these occasions&#151;that because we point out that the European budget is only a very small proportion of European public expenditure, those of us who support the European Union feel that it somehow does not matter. Of course the budget should be subjected to exactly the same disciplines and constraints as public expenditure at the national level or at the local level. No one in his or her right mind&#151;I am sure that the Minister will agree on this point&#151;would suggest that you should exert discipline on public expenditure at one level but not at another level. It is quite absurd of the noble Lord to suggest otherwise.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08042976000062"></a>My penultimate point is that, rather than being about a larger or smaller European budget, the argument ideally should concentrate on whether expenditure can be most effectively made at the European level or at the national level. It is not a case of saying a big European budget is good or bad; it is a case of saying at what level&#151;European, national, local or whatever it may be&#151;expenditure can most effectively be made in the public interest.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08042976000063"></a>The burden of proof in those circumstances should almost always be on those who wish to transfer expenditure from the national to the European. I do not think that a large budget is a sign necessarily of a  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_181"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>vigorous European Union. The European Union is about many things other than the budget and many of them are more important to the life of the European Union than the budget. In my view, the burden of proof should in general be on those who wish to transfer expenditure from the national to the European level.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08042976000064"></a>For that reason, I support a cap on the proportion of public expenditure that can be spent at the European level. I am in favour of a cap partly because I do not share the confidence that some others have in the European Parliament. Where you have an elected assembly&#151;whether it is the European Parliament on the one hand or the Scottish Parliament on the other, to take two examples&#151;that has the power to vote expenditure but is not responsible for voting the taxes that go to fund that expenditure, you tend to get the members of those assemblies generally in favour of spending. It is always nice to be in favour of spending and it is always less pleasant to be in favour of higher taxes. My own experience of the European Parliament&#151;now a very long time ago&#151;was that, in general, there was always a majority for spending more.</p>

<a name="80429-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08042976000065"></a>If the European Parliament is to exert the kind of discipline on the budget that we wish to see, it needs to be within the context of a cap so that more on one lot of things will mean less on another lot of things rather than more on everything. The lessons of the European Parliament in relation to public expenditure might very well be applied in dealing with the Scottish Parliament.</p>

It was quite remarkable how, just before the summer holidays, the rational European Parliament realised how much in pay and allowances was being stored up by provisional twelfths. I am sure that it had a salutary effect on its members to approve the budget just before the break in order to give themselves sufficient resource to go and enjoy it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08042976000067"></a>That was one of the better experiences. The worst was when the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, introduced into the European budgetary debate the question of the juste retour: &#147;Can I have my money back?&#148;. She completely failed to understand the importance of the non-compulsory expenditure part of the budget to European parliamentarians. That was the money that was being spent on environmental policies, where you did not get your money back but you got a decent European policy; on development assistance in the third world, where, again, you did not get the money back but you did something right and proper for trading relationships in the third world; and on the regional policy that helped countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal to equip themselves to join the European Union. Without those, how much money would we have spent on the defence of the southern

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08042976000068"></a>I say with absolute clarity to the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, that no one has said in the debate that the European Union budget is insignificant. Any expenditure at that level is always significant. The European Union budget is perhaps the most examined, the most clearly scrutinised, the most pored over part of our public expenditure. If we pored over defence expenditure and got paranoid about the times when the accounts of social security and work and pensions were qualified by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the same way as we do over this rather mythical refusal to sign off the budget, we would perhaps have a better state of public expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08042976000072"></a>We have to consider what the Court of Auditors does. It produces a statement of assurance based on a particular statistical base that produces&#151;I say this to my noble friend Lord Kinnock&#151;far too small a sample to necessarily predict the underlying transactions correctly. I said that frequently as a member of the Budgetary Control Committee. Of the two parts of the statement of assurance, the balance sheet has always been approved and there is always a questioning of the regularity and the reliability of the underlying transactions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08042976000073"></a>It is all very well to smirk about the underlying transactions, as the noble Lord is doing, but they are 85 per cent expended in the member states. Most of the criticisms of underlying transactions are criticisms of what happens in departments such as Defra. Of the underlying transactions that take place in this country, as my noble friend Lord Kinnock explained, most of the money is transferred money and does not even leave the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08042976000074"></a>There is a serious problem with fraud and irregularity. However, if we look at fraud and irregularity in the European Union budget carefully, we find that the majority of it is not on the expenditure side of the budget but on the revenue side&#151;the collection of own resources. One of the things that we have to do on the budget&#151;the people who have been taking the lead in this are the members of the European Parliament Committee on Budgets&#151;is to get away from the traditional own resources, which are both a diminishing part of the budget and the most fraud-prone part of the budget, and get a more sensible system of financing the European budget.</p>

We have been slow to adopt it. It has been on the agenda for a long time; a large number of parliamentarians, including me, supported it during the Convention on the Future of Europe. Tonight we should be inviting the Opposition to withdraw their amendment, although we need not in any sense beg them to, because, if we test the opinion of the Committee, the amendment will be defeated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08042995000003"></a>I begin where the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, began, in saying how much the UK has always been in favour of increasing democratic accountability and transparency of EU procedures and policy-making. As many noble Lords have pointed out, scrutiny of the budget by Parliament and Council is key to ensuring democratic accountability and transparency. Giving the European Parliament joint authority with the Council over the annual budget will increase democratic accountability, as the European Parliament will share with the Council the important task of agreeing the annual budget. However, the key budgetary decisions on the multi-annual financial framework expenditure ceilings and own resources, which I will explain further in a moment, will continue to be taken in Council&#151;by unanimity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08042995000004"></a>Noble Lords are correct in their assumptions that in the context of the annual budget procedure, the Lisbon treaty will expand member states&#146; influence. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, said, the treaty will remove the distinction between &#147;compulsory expenditure&#148; and &#147;non-compulsory&#148; spending. As the noble Lord indicated, compulsory expenditure is mostly common agricultural policy spending, over which the Council currently has the final say and which is approximately 35 per cent of the budget. As noble Lords have pointed out, the non-compulsory element is the 65 per cent over which the European Parliament currently has the final say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08042995000005"></a>Under the treaty, all spending will be subject to the same classification, and therefore no one part of the budget authority will have the final say over particular areas of the budget. We believe that that increases the Council&#146;s leverage across the budget as a whole.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="08042995000139"></a>&#147;The abolition of the distinction between compulsory (agricultural) and non-compulsory expenditure is a significant step alongside the application of the ordinary legislative procedure to agriculture policy.

I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, for his contribution and for his suggestion about the Court of Auditors. I will explain what the Court of Auditors currently is, because I am not entirely convinced about the noble Lord&#146;s suggestion; I believe that the court does what the noble Lord was suggesting it should. First, there is one member per member state. Secondly, the individuals must have belonged, at national level, to an external audit body, or be especially qualified. Thirdly, their independence must be beyond doubt. I think that that brings together a group of people of extraordinary experience, as expert as any independent group of auditors from any nation state.</p>

The accounts continue to be qualified. Billions are being wasted. If it were subject to a serious audit from an outside firm of auditors, we would get a very different result.</p>

Members of the Committee have already commented on the fact that this is the 13th year in succession that we have not had what I would describe as a clean bill of health. We are not happy about that&#151;we are concerned. However, this is not equivalent to finding fraud. Most of the irregularities that the court has found have been genuine errors which are later rectified. As in previous years, the court has said that the transactions underlying the financial statements for 2006 were legal and regular in respect of revenue, commitments and administrative payments. Further, there has been some improvement from the 6 per cent of accounts that it signed off in 2003, the 35 per cent signed off in 2004 to just over 40 per cent in 2006. Much of its difficulty in giving a positive statement arises from the areas of expenditure which are jointly managed by the EC and member states. This was almost 80 per cent of the EU budget funding in 2006.</p>

<a name="80429-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08042995000010"></a>We are talking in large part about making sure that those procedures function effectively and not about allegations of fraud. The fact that so many errors are rectified later does not mean that the court is not able to do its job properly. That is incredibly important.</p>

I would argue that it is never appropriate, but I do not think we should use it in these debates.</p>

<a name="80429-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08042995000015"></a>The noble Lord is making a separate point about the role of the Commission. The point I was making is that a lot of expenditure is through member states and that the European Court of Auditors made the point that when there is joint expenditure, some issues arise. Noble Lords who have dealt with getting accounts in public bodies will know that quite often, qualified accounts are not about irregularities that are fraudulent or cause concern; the irregularities have simply occurred in administrative measures. It does not mean that we are complacent or happy about it, but I am concerned that we are clear about what we are describing .</p>

<a name="80429-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08042995000016"></a>Members of the Committee talked about the Common Agricultural Policy and its proportion of expenditure. Agricultural expenditure has already fallen from around two-thirds of the budget in the 1980s to 44 per cent in 2007. In the course of the 2007-13 financial prospective spending, it will fall in real terms by 7 per cent.</p>

<a name="80429-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08042995000017"></a>I would like to describe the procedure as it will be, so that noble Lords who are not familiar with how it will work, as I was not, can understand it. I hope that that will be helpful, not least as noble Lords look back on this and think about other stages of the debate. I apologise to noble Lords who know this extremely well, but what is called the financial perspective is agreed by member states by unanimity. That is the overall expenditure for general areas for a seven-year period. The treaty will put that on a secure basis for the first time. There are six areas involved: sustainable growth, which is 44 per cent; natural resources, including agriculture, which is 42 per cent&#151;I am rounding these figures up; justice, home affairs and citizenship, which is 1 per cent; external relations, which is 5 per cent; administration, which is 5 per cent; and compensation to new states, which is 0.2 per cent.</p>

<a name="80429-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08042995000018"></a>The own resources decision that is then made by unanimity sets the size of the contributions to the EU budget for the period of the financial perspective&#151;in other words, for the seven years&#151;including member states&#146; contributions and rebates. That is unchanged from the current arrangements and is implemented in the UK by primary legislation, with which noble Lords will be very familiar. The annual budget procedure, which sets the levels of detailed expenditure for each year within the ceilings that have been determined by the financial perspective by unanimity by the Council, is jointly decided by the Council and the European Parliament.</p>

<a name="80429-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08042995000019"></a>I hope that puts it in perspective: the overarching figures are agreed by unanimity, there are decisions about the percentage breakdown within that, and then what happens within those budgets is jointly  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_186"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decided. After that, the Commission proposes a budget. Both the Council, by QMV, and the Parliament, by simple majority, can propose amendments if they wish. If they cannot agree on the amendments, the Council and the Parliament meet in what is now described as a Conciliation Committee, which is new. The Council, again, acts by QMV. The committee&#146;s proposals are sent back to the Council and back to the Parliament. If the Council rejects them but the European Parliament agrees them by a three-fifths majority, they are adopted. If the committee cannot agree, the Commission must submit a new budget.</p>

<a name="80429-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08042995000020"></a>The critical part of that process is that when the Conciliation Committee comes together, it consists of the Parliament and the Council. Whether the Council representatives are Ministers or officials&#151;the treaty is silent on that; that is to be worked through&#151;they will be mandated, whoever they are, probably by ECOFIN but certainly by the Council, to speak on behalf of the Council. They will go to that committee and try to reach agreement.</p>

<a name="80429-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08042995000021"></a>If the committee cannot agree, the Commission has to start again. If the committee agrees&#151;in other words, we have mandated representatives as if we were the European Council and our representatives on our behalf are no doubt reporting back and keeping us informed of each conclusion with which the Parliament agrees&#151;and for some reason, having done that, the Council rejects it when it goes back, the European Parliament then has a say.</p>

<a name="80429-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08042995000022"></a>That addresses the point of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral. I was searching my mind because when I went through this process I was looking for where the Council keeps and grows its strength, in a sense. Its strength is that if its mandated representatives cannot reach agreement in that committee with the Parliament, the whole thing is off. It is only if they have reached agreement and then the Council decides to ignore its mandated representatives that the European Parliament can step in. That is an important way in which the Council retains and, indeed, develops its role and responsibility.</p>

<a name="80429-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08042995000023"></a>Having said all that, I take nothing away from the importance and value of the role of the European Parliament. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord can withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08042995000025"></a>The one question I do not think the Minister answered was when the Government changed their mind. They went into these discussions about control of the budget with Mr Peter Hain saying clearly that they could not accept the European Parliament jointly exercising the budgetary function; that was clearly laid down, whether it was a &#147;red line&#148; or whatever. I do not think the Minister has explained to us satisfactorily when it all suddenly changed and what had been unacceptable became acceptable.

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08042995000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, mentioned greater democratic control. I dare say the other place would have loved to have been able to rewrite the Budget of Mr Brown and Mr Darling; had it been left to the Parliament, I am sure it would have done.

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08042995000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, reassured me on a number of points. He promised&#151;and I am going to hold him to this&#151;that the change would result in amendment reduction and the reorientation of the common agricultural budget. He believes it, and that is wonderful to behold&#151;but he has believed a few things in the past and then changed his mind, as he reminded us on Second Reading.</p>

The Governments who strongly supported it were the budget-disciplinarian Governments&#151;that is, those of northern Europe. The only strong support the French had was from the Polish Government.

We all know where we are; the question is, where are we heading and where are we going to end up? That is why I found this debate very interesting. I hope everything that the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock&#151;to whom I was referring before I was quite rightly interrupted&#151;has told us is going to happen will indeed happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08042995000031"></a>I do not think I am going to satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, because he has already identified me as a European enthusiast.

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08042995000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, made some important points about the &#147;provisional twelfths&#148; and introduced some relevant comments from my noble friend Lord Tugendhat as a very effective way of curbing expenditure. That was also useful. Ideally, as my noble friend said, expenditure has to be at the right level. He is a wonderful exponent of that great principle of subsidiarity. That was a helpful contribution, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08042995000033"></a>I thought the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, erred in giving the European Parliament a slightly bad name about its motivation for passing the budget just before it went on holiday.

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08042995000034"></a>I recognise the relevance of what the Minister said regarding the Court of Auditors. All I would say in support of some of the comments that have been made is that in 2005 the European Anti-fraud Office was in receipt of 12,000 reported cases of irregularities involving the EC budget, including one involving grants totalling more than &#8364;1 thousand million. There is a situation that requires remedy; whether it is through the democratic control we have spoken about in this debate or through some other route, we can continue to speculate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08042995000035"></a>This has been a valuable debate. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, said what a good debate it had been. I agree with him, but he has to recognise that it would not have taken place had it not been for the fact that the official Opposition have put down this amendment, which he and his colleagues are refusing to do on any part of the Bill.

Of course, there were presidents before, but Article 15(b) of the new treaty proposes, under subsection 6(d):</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08042995000141"></a>&#147;The President of the European Council shall, at his or her level and in that capacity, ensure the external representation of the Union on issues concerning its common foreign and security policy, without prejudice to the powers of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy&#148;.</p>

This president is to be put in place for two and a half years, renewable once and chosen by qualified majority voting. This is identical to what is in the constitution. I know that we have had long debates, and will no doubt have more, about the degree to which this treaty represents what has gone before in what was called the Constitutional Treaty, and indeed, since our last Committee meetings, the noble Baroness has been good enough to circulate quite a few letters that we have all received. The noble Baroness has been extremely busy in her letter-writing and one letter she sent explains her views on why this treaty is different, and attaches a long paper from a learned professor to that effect. I said that I would not trade quotations and I am not going to trade professors, either&#151;although I have a whole raft of professors or considerable distinction saying the opposite to her professor. I think we would tire each other if we paraded all their views at length. All that can be concluded is that professorial opinions and academic opinions of equal weight, worth and reputation are in total conflict on this issue that the Government have rather dug in on; namely, their claim that the Constitutional Treaty and this treaty are not broadly the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08042995000040"></a>I turn to the role of the president, as proposed in his or her new capacity. We should give considerable time to this&#151;possibly more than our colleagues in the other place were able to, for various reasons&#151;because the democratic instinct needs to be mobilised and applied carefully when it comes to appointing new figures, placing them on high pedestals and giving them powers that in the modern world can lead&#151;this is the result of the networked world and the information age&#151;to the magnification of celebrity at one extreme and the suppression of run of the mill and ordinary performance at the other. It is said that the effect of the information age is to increase the disparities between the lucky or meritorious ones who become famous, and the rest of us who fall into grey obscurity. We need to approach this presidential issue very carefully.</p>

It gives us the new two-and-a-half-year or five-year president of the Council; it gives us the rotating president of the Council, who was there before; the Commission president, who was there before; and of course the European Parliament president, who was there before. It also gives us the person who was called the Foreign Minister in the Constitutional Treaty and is now called the high representative, who has quasi-presidential powers as the double-hatted vice-president of the Commission and the chairman, so I understand&#151;this is one of that many issues that have not been clarified&#151;of the new Foreign Affairs Council. That figure will hold a very important role in defining the stance of the European Union on foreign policy issues, and how that fits in with the stance of the new president, as defined in the new treaty that I have just read out, is a bit of a mystery. We need to examine that carefully and give our combined views as guidance for the many issues that have yet to be resolved in this field. These are not settled matters&#151;it is not a question of reopening the treaty, but of influencing many decisions yet to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08042995000044"></a>One argument used for the longer-term presidency is that the six-monthly business was very inefficient. That is the assertion that we hear from experienced officials and those who are anxious to improve the efficiency of Europe. The same argument, interestingly, is used on the website of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In the section entitled <I>Lisbon Treaty myths, </I>it talks of the need to enlarge the powers and lengthen the term of office of the president&#151;and also, incidentally, to combine the roles of the high representative, both as a vice-chairman of the Commission and a member of the Council&#151;because, it says, this will overcome and eliminate &#147;wasteful wrangling&#148;. This is a wonderful insight into bureaucratic minds. Do these people not realise that what they think is wasteful wrangling is, to democrats, healthy argument and disagreement, which are necessary ingredients for successful democratic institutions to live and breathe? The truth is that time and again, we come up against a state of mind that I find quite objectionable, which, when it talks about efficiency, is actually talking about being able to shovel through the European Union sausage machine more laws and more regulations, more quickly, so that the ambitions of those who want more laws and more regulations can be satisfied more swiftly. That is not the kind of efficiency that a democrat should welcome, and it certainly does not bring the institutions of the European Union nearer to the people, which was the original ambition of the Laeken Council.</p>

Those who support this treaty and the role given to the new President of the European Council, particularly in the external field, do so in the belief that it will increase effectiveness. It has nothing whatever to do with the legislative process or the speed with which sausages are made in the Brussels machine&#151;I am sure that we will hear plenty about that from the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. Effectiveness is different. As the noble Lord will know, it is very often the British Government&#146;s practice to talk about efficiency and effectiveness in respect of reform of international institutions. They are two different things. We are talking about effectiveness in this case.</p>

Is it more effective, for instance, that the European Union should ram through its energy policy on biofuels? The answer, we all know now, is no. What a pity it is that the people concerned were so effective or efficient that they put the policy together, because it is turning out to be a disaster&#151;although that is not yet fully recognised by the Commission. We can think of many other cases where effectiveness and efficiency have combined to produce a policy at the centre which has been damaging and could have been stopped by more democratic argument and wrangling, with more doubts and difficulties put in the way before it was rushed into.</p>

It used to be the principle in this country, underneath our own monarchy but within our elected sphere of government, that the president should be primus inter pares, although some recent incumbents have slightly ignored it. That is the healthy democratic instinct which I would expect a Parliament such as ours to support and urge before we endow some more deeply entrenched president with a longer term of office and considerable powers&#151;although they have yet to be decided. I am obviously vulnerable to the cry that one cannot compare a gigantic Union with little Switzerland, but one can compare democratic principles wherever they flourish.</p>

If the principle in a small democracy is not to elevate on a pedestal too high a particular individual, particularly in this celebrity, media-driven age, but to have a regular rotation so that no one acquires too much power, personality or personal influence, one could perhaps argue that, in this enormous Union of around 500 million people, with its 27 rising to 28 members, the case for avoiding the overglorification of a presidential figure is even stronger. It is a cause for some sorrow to hear from the Liberal Democrat Benches that they are not worried by endowing an individual at a very high level with great power, which will probably be the case, although we have not worked out what that degree of power is meant to be.</p>

I do not know whether they will shorten our proceedings, but they are certainly extremely interesting and informative. The letter to which I refer is one that I had not seen before. It is dated 22 April and addressed to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, as chairman of his very distinguished committee. It comes from Jim Murphy and is concerned with &#147;implementation issues&#148;. It raises a whole string of concerns about the Council presidency and the role of the president, which the Slovenians, who hold the presidency until 1 July, when the French take over, want resolved. They affect us very much, as they do the powers and role of the president. We are not clear whether this will be a ceremonial or an executive figure. Will the president have real hands-on power and the capacity to influence by words, comments, speeches and opinion-forming the entire global posture of the European Union and its 27 members? We just do not know which sort of president we are dealing with. It is only fair to suggest that, before we proceed very further with the ratification of this Bill, those who are placed in authority to make these decisions

In an exchange we had the other day, that was dismissed as unlikely and, indeed, impossible. We know what the Government wanted. Some time ago, in 2003, in an impassioned speech, the current Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor made it clear that the Government were very unhappy about any kind of treaty that might leave the door open in any way to this combination of offices. The British Government wanted tough clarification in the old constitutional treaty that that should not be so. In practice the British Government did not get what they wanted, and in practice we were left with the phrase, in relation to the president, &#147;shall not serve national office&#148;. That is all. That is in both the old constitutional treaty and in the present one.</p>

The noble Baroness said that it was not true that nothing in the treaty prevented the President of the Commission also becoming the President of the European Council and she urged whoever had written that to get in touch with her, which they have duly done. I expect that she has received a letter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08042995000063"></a>It seems to me that the noble Baroness&#146;s dismissal was incorrect. The issue is being constantly aired by senior European officials, including the former Italian Prime Minister. Indeed, it has been proposed that the president should be directly elected by the current President of France. Nothing in the treaty could stop that except the words that I described. The earlier and much stronger words that the British Government wanted have failed to get into either the constitutional treaty or the present one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08042995000064"></a>Why do I spend any time on this? Why does it matter if it is said to be so unlikely? Why did it matter so much to the Government before? It is for a very obvious reason. It blurs the role between the supranational and supposedly independent Commission and the international Council. It also blurs the issue of whether or not the common foreign and security policy is ring-fenced, as Ministers repeatedly claim it is. We will come later on to that whole debate in much greater detail, as we will to the noble Baroness&#146;s fascinating observation in one of her letters that the ECJ&#146;s role in these matters is to police the frontiers between the common foreign and security policy and other Community matters.</p>

We had a try at the Iran situation, although it did not have much effect in the end. We are still struggling with that. The question is whether we want to codify and legalise all this so rigidly. That is the question. It is the question posed by this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08042995000074"></a>The main criminal justice order before us is one of the most important pieces of Northern Ireland criminal justice legislation to be brought before Parliament in many years. It provides a significant shift in the sentencing framework available to Northern Ireland&#146;s courts. We know from the extensive consultations that we have undertaken in preparing this order that it has widespread support across Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08042995000075"></a>The order changes the fundamental nature of imprisonment in Northern Ireland. It creates a new form of risk-based sentencing and release for those sentenced to prison. It creates tougher sentences; allows dangerous offenders to be locked up longer&#151;some can be held indefinitely; and permits release only when it is safe to do so. It removes the automatic 50 per cent remission which has so long been a feature of imprisonment in Northern Ireland and replaces it with a custody and supervision regime. Prisoners will henceforth spend all the custodial time announced in court in prison followed by a period of statutory post-release supervision. The entire sentence is served. The order ensures that custody is reserved for those who most merit it and provides a balanced set of powers to the courts through new community-based options. Increased post-release supervision provides added protections and helps prisoners resettle, reintegrate into their communities, and, one hopes, move away from offending.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08042995000076"></a>The second half of this order is also significant. There are a range of new powers around road traffic law, alcohol, and knife crime, and a range of procedural aspects to make Northern Ireland&#146;s criminal justice system more efficient.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08042995000077"></a>The order has its origins in a number of policy consultations and proposals carried out over a number of years. Building on a recommendation from the criminal justice review, a policy consultation was carried out in 2005 and a need for additional powers to deal with and manage dangerous violent and sexual offenders identified. A proposed draft Criminal Justice (Northern

The road traffic law proposals were subject to their own policy consultation, as were those on knife crime. Some 54 responses came in, which we consider to be particularly successful.</p>

The ad hoc committee was made up of all the main Northern Ireland parties, and all supported the sentencing package. A number of Ministers from the Northern Ireland Executive, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, also expressed support. The Probation Service supported the sentencing powers, as did the chief constable. The public, too, have supported our proposals. A major campaign resulted in a petition of some 35,000-plus signatures calling for the ending of automatic 50 per cent remission.</p>

The horrendous murder of Attracta Harron by an offender out on remission, now serving a life sentence with a whole life tariff, brought into sharp relief the need for a new form of prison sentence. Attracta&#146;s widower is present to listen to our proceedings, as he was during the Commons consideration of the order.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08042995000080"></a>There have been a number of sex offender cases where post-release supervision and monitoring has been difficult. The gaps in our laws were made abundantly clear. A sentence was needed for serious violent or sexual offences, whereby release would not be automatic, dangerousness would have to be assessed, release would be controlled and post-release supervision enhanced. This draft order delivers such sentences and 50 per cent remission will disappear as a result of the order.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08042995000081"></a>The order has three major themes: public protection; community safety; and improving the criminal justice system. On public protection, the order creates two new sentences to deal with dangerous sexual and violent offenders. One is indeterminate&#151;the indeterminate custodial sentence, or the ICS. The offender would not get out of prison until it is safe for him to be released and could be on licence for the rest of his life. The other is an extended custodial sentence, or the ECS, whereby the offender serves his custodial part and is then subject to an extended licence period, not for life but for up to a potential maximum of eight years. Once convicted, a full risk assessment is completed and, if the offender is found dangerous, one or other of these sentences must be imposed. Release will involve the newly created parole commissioners for Northern Ireland. They will assess prisoners and have safety and public protection as the focus of their work. They will be fully independent of government. Through the public protection sentences and the changes to standard imprisonment, automatic 50 per cent remission for sentenced prisoners will disappear.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08042995000082"></a>On community safety, prisoners will be subject to statutory supervision in the community and to recall if they fail to comply with conditions. The powers to  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_197"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deal with and manage sex offenders in the community are enhanced. The Multi-Agency Sex Offender Risk Assessment and Management&#151;the MASRAM process&#151;will now become statutory. A range of agencies will be required to work together and share information to increase protection and reduce risk posed by sexual and violent offenders. Powers will allow electronic monitoring or tagging of offenders in the community. That could be as a bail condition, a licence condition, or as part of a community order. Post-release supervision will provide an important level of protection and reassurance to communities, but it also provides continuity in offender management and helps prisoners to resettle into community life. All these ensure that offenders are properly supervised, managed and rehabilitated.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08042995000083"></a>The order tackles areas of specific and current concern to communities. It deals with knife crime; improves alcohol laws and under-age drinking, so often causes of anti-social behaviour, and improves road traffic law. Knife crime powers deal with both possession and supply of knives and offensive weapons, creating a strong package of sentences of up to four years&#146; imprisonment across the board. On alcohol, there are powers to deal with public drinking and the sale of alcohol to minors. Councils will be able to designate areas in consultation with police whereby drinking in public will be better regulated, and age restrictions on off-sales will be policed through a test purchase power. My honourable friend in the other place, Paul Goggins, has published guidance on how this will operate.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08042995000084"></a>During a period when I was a direct rule Minister in Northern Ireland and responsible in part for a policy on children and young people, I met with a group of young people who were on a week&#146;s community involvement. I do not need to say where, as it is not important, but they were from both of the communities. They had a week together in which to discuss art projects, sport and so on. I faced them for about an hour. It took me 10 minutes or so to get them going asking questions, but then I could not get out of the room, after the hour. I asked them what the message should be and what the key things were. They raised two issues with me, both of which I have referred to. One of them is highly relevant to what I have just said about alcohol. They argued about how they were described in the press and told me that they wanted to get rid of the blue plastic bags. That was the first time I had heard that phrase used about the off-licence unmarked plastic bags, which are almost there to encourage underage drinking. The only way in which to deal with this is to have test purposes to ensure that licensing rules are being followed. So off-licences and off-sales are on notice. As I say, the youngsters that I met demanded some action on that because it gave them a bad name and saw their compatriots led into bad ways.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08042995000085"></a>On road traffic, additional police powers to tackle drink driving, speeding and seizure of vehicles, such as quad bikes or motorised scooters which can be a plague in some estates or communities, are created in the order. Sentences have been increased for driving while disqualified or without insurance, two offences which frequently see multiple offences coming before the courts.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08042995000086"></a>On the criminal justice system, one of the order&#146;s aims is to ensure that the system works effectively and well. The right services and punishments need to be targeted at the right type of offender. We are expanding the police&#146;s powers to attach conditions to bail, and prison law is modernised in a number of areas. For example, 17 year-old girls will be able to go to the juvenile justice centre rather than be held in an adult prison. We are expanding the use of live video links between prisons and courts, improving flexibility around the execution of arrest warrants, and creating more efficient systems to deal with breach proceedings.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08042995000087"></a>Perhaps one of the most significant improvements will be the power of the court to impose a form of community sentence on those who default on a fine. For too long we have seen numerous fine defaulters end up in prison&#151;something that I and some Members of another place have always considered a ludicrous proposition. You can get the money back other ways; imprisoning those people is a complete waste of resources and does not assist at all. So this is a very helpful change. Prisons should be for the more serious offenders and the supervised activity order, managed in the community by the Probation Service, will be constructive, restorative and more effective in dealing with the problem of fine default.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08042995000088"></a>Two further points about resources and choices are important. In the consultation exercise many people sought assurances that the system could cope with this very substantial package. I assure your Lordships' House that the package of proposals can and will be properly resourced. Almost &#163;14 million has been allocated for implementation. That includes &#163;5 million for prisons, probation and tagging. The Probation Service alone will be appointing over 50 additional probation officers.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08042995000089"></a>A dedicated implementation team will take forward the proposals. Public protection sentences and the appointment of parole commissioners will be our first and most urgent priority. They will be in place in a matter of weeks with other powers being rolled out over the next year or so.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08042995000090"></a>Public protection is one of the key aims that the order sets out to achieve but we also need to maintain perspective about what legislation can do. Offenders make choices&#151;for better or worse. The system can help them with their choices, help them resettle, supervise them and, where appropriate, manage the risk they present. We can put the powers in place, require compliance and supervision and do all that we can to reduce the risk, but what we cannot do is guarantee an end to crime, nor, sad to say, can we guarantee an end to serious sexual or violent crime. However, we are confident that this package will succeed. It fills many of the gaps identified in the current law.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08042995000091"></a>The focus of my speech this evening has been on the main order. The consequential amendments order also before the House is by and large a short technical piece to allow the main provisions to work in a UK context. It adds reference to the parole commissioners into House of Commons disqualification law and includes them in freedom of information legislation requirements. It also allows the new licensing regimes

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08042995000092"></a>In conclusion, I am pleased to be bringing before your Lordships' House today this package of sentencing powers to deal with dangerous violent and sexual offenders; to strengthen post-release supervision across the board; and to remove 50 per cent remission. As I said, it has been widely consulted on, and has the support of Assembly Members in Northern Ireland. I hope the day is not too far away when they will deal with these issues themselves. The legislation is ready and has been consulted on and the people of Northern Ireland do not deserve to have it delayed. I commend this order and the subsequent order, which I will move at the appropriate time. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08042995000093"></a>Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 3 March be approved. <I>16th</I><sup><I></I></sup><I>report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Rooker</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="08042995000094"></a><a name="80429-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80429-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08042995000180"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> My Lords, I again thank the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for presenting the order, which in some ways is particularly complex and difficult. It is virtually a Bill waiting to be enacted. I understand that even more clearly now than previously. Generally, we support it. It is a positive revision of the criminal justice process in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08042995000095"></a>When I was first faced with the order and its extremely comprehensive supporting documents, I thought, &#147;Oh, God, we are back to the old days of trying to debate a Bill as an order in the dinner hour&#148;. However, as the noble Lord said, this is the first major instrument, whether a Bill or a statutory instrument, that has come here after being debated&#151;I hope in detail&#151;analysed and supported by the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08042995000096"></a>This is a very special moment, certainly for me after enduring 10 years of these wretched statutory instruments on which we have to try to make decisions on behalf of other people. From that point of view, this is a superb moment. I hope that this measure will bring us more into line with the UK&#146;s 2003 Act and that it will contain improvements because that Act has operated here for four years. I am sure that the officials who kindly briefed me this evening before we came into your Lordships&#146; House will have made significant improvements to this statutory instrument.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08042995000097"></a>I strongly support almost all the major provisions, particularly the removal of the automatic 50 per cent remission. That will make a big difference to criminals who think that they will get 10 years&#146; imprisonment but will be out in five years or perhaps fewer. I suspect that, in those circumstances, they tend to take life very much less seriously, not that I have any first-hand examples or even experience of that.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08042995000098"></a>The success of the statutory instrument will all depend on what resources not only the Government but the Northern Ireland Assembly make available. Undoubtedly, the prison population will increase as a result of the changes in the sentencing laws. I hope that the Minister will give the Government&#146;s estimate in that regard. I imagine that somebody has done some work on this. I heard the noble Lord mention two figures, &#163;14 million and &#163;5 million, but what is the total anticipated increase in the cost of these  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_200"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>changes to the judicial processes? Where will the resources come from and who will ensure that they are available over the next three to five years, because this will not all happen at once? The order makes it clear that its measures are to be phased in over several years. I suspect that they probably will not become completely operative until such time as criminal justice is totally devolved to the Assembly.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08042995000099"></a>Where will the increased prison population be housed and how will it be housed? I believe there are plans to knock down and redevelop Maghaberry prison, which would remove quite a number of bed spaces&#151;I do not know the number&#151;in one fell swoop. The inhabitants of those bed spaces would have to be put up somewhere else. I want to be reassured&#151;this is not criticism, as I do not want to criticise anything here&#151;that the Government understand what resources will be required under this excellent piece of legislation that we shall pass tonight, that they know where they will come from and who will be responsible for delivering them. I support the order, which is a terrific piece of legislation.</p>

Once again it falls to these Benches to be a little more robust in questioning him. We have only about 40 minutes to discuss this major piece of legislation. It is disappointing that such measures are not being introduced in primary legislation, although I accept that the Minister has engaged in long and detailed consultation on the issues in Northern Ireland. However, some of them are controversial. Prisoners also have rights and we must all recognise that, as it is the measure of a civilised and democratic society. Introducing indeterminate sentencing has proved to be highly problematic in England and Wales. Imprisonment for public protection&#151;IPP&#151;can be applied to 153 serious offences. That is a huge number when you compare it with the 11 offences that bring an automatic life sentence into effect.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08042995000101"></a>These provisions are being tested all the time. The Court of Appeal has said that courts should presume that anyone convicted of one of the offences, and who has previous convictions, is dangerous unless the conclusion reached would be unreasonable. At least a little sense has prevailed in the Northern Ireland legislation, for which I am grateful, in that there will be a minimum tariff of at least 12 months for an extended custodial sentence, an ECS, and a two-year minimum tariff for an indeterminate custodial sentence, an ICS.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08042995000102"></a>Will Northern Ireland be able to resource the IPPs better than appeared to be the case in England and Wales? That follows the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, about resourcing. An IPP can be compared with a life sentence in that it involves a minimum prison term, after which a prisoner has to undergo some behaviour management courses. Only then can he or she be released at the discretion of the Parole Board. The release is on licence for 10 years at least, it is under supervision and it takes place only if the Parole Board considers that it is safe to release that person.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_201"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80429-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08042995000103"></a>Can the Minister assure me that the courses offered in behaviour management will be sufficient in number and robust enough for people to demonstrate that they are fit for release? My noble friend Lady Linklater of Butterstone told us last year of a case in which she had been involved, which entailed a prisoner with a 28-day tariff being denied the courses that he needed to enable him to have a review by the Parole Board, because the courses simply were not available. What provisions have been put in place to ensure that this sort of thing will not happen in Northern Ireland? I understand that problems have also arisen in HMP Maghaberry and HMP Magilligan, because there have not been sufficient offending behaviour programmes or places available on courses there to meet the needs of prisoners. Has that situation changed?</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08042995000104"></a>The Minister will know of the High Court decision in July last year that it was unlawful to hold prisoners when they could not access courses that were designed to address their offending behaviour and prove that they were fit for release. I understand that &#163;40 million has been made available for the implementation of the new sentencing provisions. What will the breakdown of that money look like?</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08042995000105"></a>On these Benches, we have always maintained that it is of primary importance to ensure that those in need of therapeutic care do not end up in prison. Will the Northern Ireland Prison Service be able to deal with the provisions of the order in terms of meeting the many and varied needs of those prisoners in custody for an indeterminate period who have physical and mental problems? Will it have the skills to enable it to prove that prisoners are safe to be released? Can the Minister say what work has been done in this area? Will the new sentencing and licensing arrangements be subject to review, as recommended by the Assembly&#146;s ad hoc committee that looked at these matters?</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08042995000106"></a>I, too, welcome the supervised activity orders set out in Article 45. This is a good idea and is a good alternative to custody for fine defaulters. As the Minister said, the previous situation was always ridiculous. When I was a magistrate, I found the notion that one had to put people in prison because they defaulted on payment of a fine iniquitous. In Northern Ireland, between September 2005 and February 2007, 44 per cent of women who were sent to prison were there because they were fine defaulters. That cannot possibly be right.</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08042995000107"></a>I hope that access to the provisions in these orders is uniformly administered. It would be iniquitous for them to be available in some places and not others. Is the probation service in Northern Ireland satisfied that it is being given sufficient resources to enable it to use these provisions equitably? The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, made that point. The Assembly committee also recommended that sentencers be given adequate training in how to deal with indeterminate sentencing. Can the Minister assure us that that training is being given?</p>

<a name="80429-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08042995000108"></a>Finally, I quote what the Northern Ireland Assembly&#146;s report on the draft Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order said on youth justice, which is dealt with under Articles 94 to 98. The report states:</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_202"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08042995000143"></a>&#147;In relation to the juvenile justice provisions in Article 95, the Committee received evidence from Criminal Justice Inspection and NIACRO who thought that the Article as drafted put the emphasis the wrong way round as children would be referred to Hydebank Wood Young Offenders Centre where Inspectors regard the regime on offer as gravely inadequate. CJI believed that, on the contrary, the presumption should be that 17-year-old males should be sent to the Juvenile Justice Centre unless either there is no room for them there or they are so difficult to manage that the JJC cannot cope with them. Females under 18 should not, in any circumstances that CJI could envisage, be sent to Ash House&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042995000136"></a>The Minister has indicated that females will, indeed, not go there. I am concerned about the young males and I would be grateful if the Minister would reflect on that matter.</p>

I believe that, while criminal justice continues to be the responsibility of the Westminster Parliament, whether that is for a long or a short period, primary legislation should be the vehicle used. For someone such as me who takes an interest in law and order matters but is not a lawyer, to be faced with a few moments to discuss a 95-page document is not heartening. It is not possible do deal with it adequately. I know that this order reflects the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. There is no acceptable reason why the public in Northern Ireland have had to wait five years for the protection of a sentencing regime designed to tackle dangerous offenders.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08042995000110"></a>I wish to move on quickly. I hope that dangerous offenders will, after they serve their sentences and are released from prison, not be part of the farce that has occurred in England and Wales, where serious offenders have, due to lack of resources, been released beyond their tariff without completing compulsory pre-release courses. That must not be repeated in Northern Ireland. However, I have serious fears that it will be repeated there. When Tony Blair was Prime Minister, we had many promises about what would ensue if we could achieve agreement and peace, yet the Police Service of Northern Ireland is underresourced. I am concerned with the management of the PSNI, but part of that is a result of underresourcing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08042995000111"></a>A visitor to this House tonight mentioned that in the part of the country in which he lives&#151;indeed, it is the case in the part of the country where I live&#151;it is not possible for night-time patrols to be carried out as they should be because of a lack of resources. A lack of resources in policing is a very bad basis on which to try to consider devolution of policing and justice. I have made that point previously and I make it again. I hope that the Minister will reassure us about funding and how the whole issue of sentencing, of keeping people in prison and of getting people out of prison and back into the community will be financed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08042995000112"></a>There are aspects of the order that I disagree with, including the test-purchase provisions on the sale of alcohol, which I find abhorrent. It is absolutely ridiculous that we will use underage children to carry out these test purchases in a community that remains unstable in terms of criminality. Can one imagine what will happen if it is learnt that little Joe Bloggs was the guy who led to someone being taken to court

He could well become a victim; he could well finish up being the sort of person who needs protection. The last thing that we want in a society where people have had to be protected against terrorists for years is to have vulnerable young people requiring protection against thugs and bullies. What reassurance can the Minister give me on that?</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08042995000113"></a>On the subject of young people, the Minister knows well my interest in autism spectrum disorder. I wonder whether there is, within the context of this Bill, a consideration of those young people on the autism spectrum who accidentally, not understanding the situation, get themselves into confrontation with the police. I had an interesting and productive meeting with senior officials from the Prison Service about a review of autism services that I am involved with; I was very heartened by the enthusiasm that the Prison Service showed for something being done in relation to these vulnerable young people. I had a similar meeting with the PSNI and suffice it to say that I was not enamoured by the reception that I received. I ask the Minister to ensure that, in terms of justice, there is protection for those young people who are vulnerable.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08042995000114"></a>I will leave it there because of time, except to say one final thing. Devolution of policing and justice to Northern Ireland cannot occur successfully unless this whole broad perspective of law and order is taken into account.</p>

<a name="08042995000115"></a><a name="80429-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80429-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08042995000183"></a>Lord Bew:</b> My Lords, I commend the Minister for bringing the order before the House. There is considerable public concern about this matter in Northern Ireland, where 35,000 people signed a petition bearing on the central issues of this new legislation. As he rightly said, there is in the Assembly cross-party consensus, articulated most firmly by the chairman of the ad hoc committee, Mr Alban Maginness, in favour of what the Government are now doing. The Government are living up to their responsibilities. It has been a long time coming, as the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, said, but it has now, thank heavens, come.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08042995000116"></a>It is also worth saying that the Government have resisted the temptation to play politics with this issue. They have acted on what, as the Minister said in the last few sentences of his speech, are in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland at the moment. There is a certain grim symbolism in the fact that this legislation comes to this Chamber tonight, a few days short of the time that was originally projected in the St Andrews agreement for the devolution of our policing and justice powers to Northern Ireland. There is a tacit acceptance by the Government that that will not happen in the immediate future. They have taken on the responsibility themselves and not used that broader issue as an excuse for delay. That is an important and valuable thing.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08042995000117"></a>It is true the Northern Ireland Assembly has worked closely with the Government on this, but it is disappointing that it is not able to deal with the matter itself. The fact that Sir David Varney has been asked now to look at competitiveness in the Northern Irish economy looks like another example of the Assembly outsourcing problems back to London. All

It is disappointing that the Assembly is not in the position yet to deal with this matter, but it is good that the Government have dealt with it.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08042995000118"></a>Finally, there is perhaps a small glitch in the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland Consequential Amendments) Order. At the bottom of the first page, there is a reference to the Parole Commissioner for Northern Ireland in the singular, whereas in the middle of the next page there is a reference to commissioners in the plural. I cannot see that there is any good reason for that. It should be either singular or plural in both cases. It looks like there is a small and tiny glitch there, the only glitch in what seems to be some quite exceptionally good Civil Service work.</p>

I hope the Minister will tolerate what I want to ask him. I glanced through the order. Article 20 deals with the power to release certain prisoners on compassionate grounds. That is how the article is headed. I hope your Lordships will bear with me for half a minute. During my time in Northern Ireland I received a call when I was the duty Minister. One of the prisoners wished to have compassionate release for a short period because his mother was not well. I had not had the kind of briefing that the Minister has had as security and prisons and such things were not within my remit. I had had a general briefing but not on how to deal with a specific instance of this type. I received advice from the prisons sector that this leave for compassionate release for a short period overnight should not be granted to this prisoner. Others advised me that it was safe. I was advised that such release was workable. If somebody abused this granting of compassionate leave, the next time compassionate leave was requested, there might be more problems. I was somewhat startled to receive a message that had come through from my department that, unfortunately, the prisoner's mother had died but that enormous happiness was given by the fact that the young man was able to be present. Specific instructions were given to me; everyone knew the drill and it seemed to work well.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08042995000120"></a>If the Minister glances at Article 20(2), he will see that it states,</p>
<ul><a name="08042995000145"></a>&#147;consult the Parole Commissioners unless the circumstances are such&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042995000137"></a>I did not have the occasion to consult higher authority in any major detail in those circumstances, but it worked. I hope that such compassionate leave can and will be granted in future.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08042995000121"></a>I also glanced further on in the order. Article 65 concerns:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08042995000144"></a>&#147;Seizure of vehicles used in a manner causing alarm, distress or annoyance&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042995000138"></a>I seem to remember that 40 years ago, musical horns in motor cars were very popular. Indeed, I seem to remember that one small car used to parade around London. It had a happy number plate that was, as the  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_205"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Army would put it, Foxtrot Unicorn 2. I leave your Lordships to discuss what that might mean. The young gentleman who owned that car had a musical horn that played melodies. Other people would gesture to him, which I understand caused more accidents. Musical horns are banned in Great Britain. I hope that the same applies to Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08042995000122"></a>One other system occurred to me. In summer, certainly in Scotland&#151;I suspect in England; I do not know about Northern Ireland&#151;ice cream vans tour various areas playing musical chimes. It just occurred to me, being of a somewhat quixotic nature, that such melodies may well be unwelcome in some areas and that melodies advertising the proximity of ice cream sales could well cause either deliberate or unwitting annoyance. Perhaps the noble Lord will write to me about that case.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08042995000123"></a>If the Minister could advise me this evening very briefly on Article 20, I should be very grateful. I humbly congratulate him on putting this order through so well and succinctly tonight.</p>

<a name="08042995000124"></a><a name="80429-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80429-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08042995000185"></a>Lord Laird:</b> My Lords, I join other noble Lords in thanking the Minister for his explanation of the orders and in giving the orders a broad welcome. It is good that that they will bring the legislation in Northern Ireland broadly into line with the rest of the United Kingdom. There has been considerable demand in Northern Ireland for a review of sentencing. Every time that someone has unfortunately been killed by a joyrider or a drunken person, there has been considerable clamour when the defendant who is found guilty gets an extremely light sentence.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08042995000125"></a>I join the Minister in recognising that we have in the House tonight Attracta Harron&#146;s widower. It is becumbent on us all to recognise the tremendous dignity that the Harron family had in their tragic loss of their mother in dreadful circumstances. It is also fair to point out that had the person who has been convicted for that murder, Trevor Hamilton, not been released early from prison, had he been tagged or had there been supervision, Attracta Harron could very well be alive tonight. In other words, if the order had been in place, Attracta Harron could be alive tonight.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08042995000126"></a>I shall make a couple of quick points, because time is going on. It is not easy to talk about security issues for Northern Ireland over here. I am still very concerned about the lack of prosecutions because of political interest. I am concerned about a recent statement from the Forensic Science Agency, which said that it now has the techniques for DNA testing that mean that it could go through the entire arsenal of rifles, guns and other machinery that have been taken off paramilitaries through crimes during the past 30 years and could identify an awful lot of people and evidence. Unfortunately, I see no evidence of that being taken up by the Historic Inquiries Team, which seems strangely reluctant to involve its colleagues in the art of DNA science to find out who used those guns, and so on. The people who look at the DNA are plugged into an extremely advanced computer system&#151;possibly one of the most advanced in the world&#151;which can identify people immediately from the DNA and indicate where they were on certain nights.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08042995000127"></a>I am also concerned about the ongoing lack of prosecutions for fuel laundering and other fuel offences. The Government&#146;s own figures for a number of months ago indicate that in Northern Ireland the Government lose taxes at the rate of &#163;365 million per year because of fuel laundering, mostly in South Armagh. That is &#163;1 million per day. I think of the number of hospitals and other things that the Government and the Executive of Northern Ireland could fund with that money. We see very few people who have been made amenable to fuel laundering. I do not expect the Minister to answer these questions today. I will probably pursue these things through Parliamentary Questions in due course.</p>

<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="08042995000128"></a> My Lords, I most grateful for the general response to the order and I will do my best to answer all the points that have been raised. I would say at the outset that I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, need apologise for speaking in these debates. Given his track record as a direct rule Minister in Northern Ireland, they were still talking about him when I was there and it was all good. I had an easy time compared to my predecessors in respect of direct-rule duties.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08042995000129"></a>I will come on to these specific questions. I will try to go through them in order and try not to repeat myself. With regard to resources, approximately &#163;14 million worth of costs has been allocated. Of this &#163;4.7 million goes to prisons, &#163;6 million to probation and something over &#163;3 million to support structures for the parole commissioners, executive release and recall and electronic monitoring. Funding to the probation board will ensure effective risk assessment and supervision of offenders. It will include a recruitment of 55 front-line staff. We are confident that the package of measures will be properly resourced.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08042995000130"></a>I was asked a couple of times whether we had learnt the lessons about problems in England or Wales. The prison service has been fully engaged in the resource package. An additional &#163;70 million has been set aside to provide an additional 400 cell spaces by the year 2011. The additional resources for the sentencing framework are to build on the existing risk management and programme delivery provision. The prisons would have been getting these offenders anyway under the existing sentencing framework. A new prison will be built at the Magilligan facility. There will be redevelopment there and new places.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08042995000131"></a>I was asked specifically about the figures. These are the best estimates we have at present. We anticipate that the new framework will lead over time to a net increase of some 60 to 65 in the average prison population. Initially we think that the impact on the population will be minimal but by 2021 the increasing impact will level off at a gross increase of about 160 in the average population. At the same time, however, counterbalancing measures, electronic monitoring and fine default alternatives will have an effect. That 160 is a gross figure. It is not a large increase but certainly there is potential for offenders to be kept in prison longer. Over 10 to 15 years this will lead to that increase in the prison population.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08042995000132"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, asked about the availability of participation programmes. The prisons are already delivering offender behaviour  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_207"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>programmes. The additional resource of almost &#163;5 million is to build on and extend that provision. She is right to say the probation and prison services are working closely together to develop a strategy, although she concentrated almost exclusively on prisoners&#146; rights. They do have rights but at the beginning and end of time it is the victims and stable communities we are trying to help. We need to lock up the right people not the wrong people. We also need to keep them locked up for as long as necessary to protect society. However, as the noble Baroness said, they do have rights.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08042995000133"></a>In prison the offenders cannot be forced to participate in programmes but it will be in their interest to do so. We need to change their behaviour. If they want to demonstrate to the parole commissioners that they are fit for release that is their choice. Once released, if participation in programmes is part of the licence condition then non-compliance could result in immediate recall to custody.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="080429104000002"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the presumption of dangerousness. This has been removed from our powers. It still exists in the England and Wales criminal justice legislation, but as she probably knows better than I, it is being removed by way of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill currently before your Lordships&#146; House. She also asked whether the sentencing and licensing arrangements are subject to review, and I can tell her that they are. It is proper for such a substantial change in the sentencing framework to be kept under review, and the security Minister is committed to reviewing the position in the Commons debate held yesterday, so it is on the record.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="080429104000003"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the delivery of supervised activity orders and resources for probation services. I hope that I have covered those areas. We are fully engaged on the costings and we shall probably get more information on supervised activity orders in the summer. The programme will be rolled out along with a package of other measures. This is not all going to happen overnight.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="080429104000004"></a>Lessons have been learnt. We have built adjustments into the provisions to ensure that Northern Ireland gets the benefit of the experience of England and Wales. We are making the new sentences available in the Crown Court. They will focus on the most serious offences and will not draw in the magistrates&#146; court. We are allowing judges the discretion to choose between the two types of public protection sentence and we are making no presumption of risk where there are previous convictions for specified offences. The sentence will be imposed on the basis of a rigorous risk assessment.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="080429104000005"></a>The noble Baroness put one question to me for which I suspect I do not have an answer that will satisfy her, and that relates to 17 year-olds. As I made clear, females aged 17 will not go to prison. However, given the significantly high number of 17 year-olds in relation to other groups in the youth justice system, we believe that to attempt to accommodate them in the juvenile justice centre would not only be impractical but have the effect of skewing the age range disproportionately, thereby distorting the regime for the younger children already being accommodated in the centre. There is only one juvenile justice centre in  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_208"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Northern Ireland, and there is a requirement to retain some capacity in order to be flexible enough to respond to fluctuating numbers. Reversing the proposal would make the current system unworkable and unmanageable. If all 17 year-olds were to be accommodated in the centre, it would be constantly full, with the high probability that the very young children there would be sent elsewhere, or other young people already settled in the centre, would have to be displaced.</p>

He said in his peroration that a lot of money was being put towards creating more prison places in Northern Ireland. Why cannot a further JJC be adapted for young males of 17 who clearly are more numerous than can be looked after in the existing institution? That would be a good use of the money.</p>

There probably is a response and I shall write to her, because her question is reasonable.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="080429104000008"></a>I turn to the statistics. Between 2005 and 2007, 23 girls aged 17 were held in women&#146;s prisons. I do not dismiss the figure; I am just giving the House the information. I mentioned that the consultation process had been lengthy in response to complaints that this has taken a long time, and I fully accept that. But I also make the point that now we have these provisions ready, the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to benefit from them.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="080429104000009"></a>I can deal with some of the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, but I shall have to write to him on others. The noble Lord gave examples to demonstrate why he is opposed to test purchase powers, but these powers are not new. They already exist around tobacco and solvent abuse for the purpose of protecting young people, and I am fairly confident about them. The vociferousness of the youngsters who raised the issue with me and the fact that it can be carefully managed gives me confidence, although I understand that some people might be placed in a difficult position. However, the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, has fired a warning shot, and therefore those who operate the system will have to be incredibly careful and ensure that it is well managed. It is not entrapment, but legitimate crime detection. Off-licence sellers of alcohol have to be put on notice that selling to underage youngsters will get them in real trouble and put them at risk of losing their livelihood. Our priority is to reduce such sales. We can give warnings and advance notice of schemes in an area, and we can issue warnings for initial non-compliance. The participants will not mislead licence holders. It is a perfectly legitimate procedure and is used in other circumstances to protect young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="080429104000010"></a>The noble Lord rightly raised important points about vulnerable young offenders. The system already allows the police considerable discretion and we know that they operate with these factors in mind. Within this order are specific requirements should such

This is important in relation to inquiry, mental health and other medical reports, which will also ensure that prosecutions are brought appropriately. No doubt the defence and the prosecution will have to take account of this, as will judges. The noble Lord raised a fair point.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="080429104000011"></a>I am very grateful for all the supportive comments. I cannot go through everything in detail, but I am very grateful. The noble Lord, Lord Bew, did not quite use the word, but he implied that the Assembly was subcontracting some of its work. I do not think it is that. Having been so long without the process, it makes sense to use the best possible help and advice around because it wants to make early progress. It wants some wins for the people of Northern Ireland to show that devolution makes a difference to people&#146;s lives. I cannot comment on the help and assistance it has requested, but I think that that is its judgment. When the Assembly becomes more stable and more mature in the process of legislation, I am sure more can be done in-house. The noble Lord also asked about the consequential amendment order. I am advised that the references are correct and we will write to confirm this, so the point is well made.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="080429104000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, asked about the compassionate release power. It will continue to build on the temporary release powers that correctly exist to allow short-term release. I fully accept his point. He gave a very good example of the difficulty for a Minister asked to make a decision, probably within a few hours, and receiving conflicting advice. It is not his day job; he is the duty Minister, covering for others. That is the dilemma. I suppose that in some ways that is what Ministers are for&#151;a judgment has to be made. In this case it was made successfully, but it would not have been unsuccessful if it had gone wrong. You have to make a judgment and then be responsible for it.</p>

<a name="80429-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="080429104000013"></a>Prisoners can get out temporarily for urgent family matters, subject to risk assessment, and that would have been the case there. But it is a compassionate power and can allow for example, terminally ill prisoners to be dealt with in a compassionate way. It is a package around the whole process.</p>

<a name="0804303000003"></a><a name="80429-0014.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80429-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0804303000083"></a>Lord Stoddart of Swindon:</b> This concerns a very important new provision in the treaty. We should make no mistake about it: it is a further step on the way to creating a centralised European state. There can be no other reason for it. Indeed, from the point of view of the smaller nations, it is a retrograde step; with a rotating presidency, at least they have a turn at that office. I am not at all sure that from now on they will ever have a turn at holding the presidency of the European Union.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="0804303000004"></a>In history, whenever an office such as this&#151;a chairman of something&#151;has been set up, it has always evolved. The chairman wants more power and the members want to give him more power because, if he has more power, there is less for them to do. Therefore, all history shows that, once you give senior office to people, the whole thing tends to develop into a new power centre. If people do not believe that, they should look at the development of the European Parliament. I think that the European Parliament came into existence under the Single European Act but before then it had been a European Assembly. Until 1977, it was not a directly elected assembly but a representative body of the national parliaments. However, as soon as it became directly elected, as some of us predicted, it became more powerful. It was renamed as a parliament, and in each treaty since the Single European Act the European Parliament has accreted to itself, or has been given, new powers so that it has become a much more important part of the European Union. Indeed, only this afternoon, just before this debate, we saw that it had accrued new powers under this treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="0804303000005"></a>As I said, all history shows that once you make an office permanent&#151;indeed, when you create an office for which you do not immediately know what the powers will be&#151;there is every incentive to build that office into a very powerful position. We are being asked to give permission to a pig in a poke. We do not know what powers will be exercised by the new president. We know that he will try to accrue more powers to himself and, of course, the ultimate aim will be an elected president by universal suffrage. That is the end product and it is what the new president

I appreciate that there is nothing wrong with that. I do not want it; nevertheless, that is what it is all about. This evening, we are being asked to create a permanent presidency or semi-permanent presidency or whatever it is called&#151;it will, at any rate, last for up to five years&#151;and certainly for the first two and a half years the president will build up his position so that he gets elected for another two and a half years. We have seen it all before.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="0804303000006"></a>I feel sure that the noble Baroness will reassure me on this. She will say, &#147;Of course, the British Government do not believe any of this at all. They simply think that, as we heard earlier, it will be a more efficient way of driving things forward&#148;. However, I do not want things to be driven forward. Nevertheless, that is what we will be told the role is about. At present, however, we are aware that private discussions are going on about the role of the presidency. Some pretty powerful people believe that it should be a leading role and that the president should in fact act like one, not like a lord mayor. Our former Prime Minister foresaw this position as being one where the President of the European Council spoke for Europe on the world stage&#151;quite clearly, a powerful post indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="0804303000007"></a>Noble Lords will have seen that when Mr Blair&#146;s name was put forward for the post of president, he quite clearly said that he would consider accepting the position only if it were a powerful one. He did not want any sort of job that was simply meeting people or holding banquets and what have you for visiting diplomats or heads of state. He sees it, as he saw it at the beginning, as a powerful position&#151;one that will get more powerful as time goes on. The Prime Minister of Belgium certainly sees the position as very powerful, and has said as much. I believe that he is a candidate as well. He has said that if he gets into the job, he will be trying to make it very important indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="0804303000020"></a>We on these Benches regret that Amendment No. 9 has been tabled. The adjective used has changed over a short time. Those of us who are interested in philology will reflect on the changes in language over time. For instance, in English, the words &#147;thank you&#148; have now been replaced by the word &#147;cheers&#148;, which now means &#147;thank you&#148; on all occasions. When you are getting out of a taxi and saying goodbye to the driver you say &#147;cheers&#148; rather than &#147;thank you&#148;. That has taken probably about nine years to evolve.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="0804303000021"></a>In this case, the adjective for the nature, quality and texture of the amendments from our Tory colleagues last Tuesday&#151;the first allotted day of the Committee of the whole House&#151;was always that the amendments were &#147;probing&#148;, whereas in the Commons the text was always presented as &#147;wrecking&#148; amendments. So the adjective &#147;probing&#148; has evolved from &#147;wrecking&#148; in the space of four weeks. That demonstrates how language can change rapidly depending on the examples provided.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="0804303000022"></a>We believe that the amendment would be destructive and we hope it will not be taken further. The creation of this post will be important for the future progress of the enlarged and complicated European Union of 27 member states. The important change envisaged is the creation of the post of a new full-time president for a first period of two-and-a-half years, renewable by only one similar period, making up to five years for the same individual. This would be the person to drive forward&#151;a phrase which was also used by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, though he does not approve of it&#151;the European Union policies. I use the modern phraseology &#147;drive forward&#148; because the European Union needs a powerful and respected figure as president to drive forward the agreed consensus policies of the sovereign member states. That is what it is in essence, and that is what it will remain in the future&#151;in this highly non-federal, unfederalistic European Union.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0804303000023"></a>The European Union is a modern creation which is not easy to describe in the context of the history of political and state structures. It is a unique body, sui generis in every way; a Union of sovereign member states. The member states will inevitably allocate to individuals, and to the central institutions which were freely and happily adopted by them, a considerable amount of discretion and intrinsic power, of whatever nature, in the actualit&#233; of how the role unfolds in the future. Logically, we do not know what that will be because it is a new post and many details will have to be discussed when and if the treaty is ratified by all the member states, which could take up until the end of this year.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0804303000024"></a>There is currently a President of the European Council but that position has been weakened in the increasingly enlarged community. All the people involved in it have repeatedly said in recent years that the troika system has not been able to function effectively and that the six-month period for an individual chairman of the Council of Ministers and the European Council has not produced sufficient results. It is a complex exercise and this new creation is necessary.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0804303000025"></a>Amendment No. 9 is negative because it seeks to remove the role of the President of the European Council in external representation of the European Union. The President of the European Council now has the role of representing the EU externally. A good example is that Slovenia will lead the EU-Japan summit later this month.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="0804303000026"></a>For all those reasons we hope the amendment will not make progress tonight and that other members of the Committee will endorse that view.</p>

But many of the speeches, including that by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, implied that they wanted nothing to do with the President of the European Council at all.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0804303000028"></a>It is also being suggested that the President of the Commission might at the same time become President of the European Council despite the fact that the treaty says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="0804303000077"></a>&#147;Members of the Commission may not, during their term of office, engage in any other occupation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0804303000076"></a>That seems to me to debar totally the President of the Commission becoming at the same time President of the European Council. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, seems to think that the rotating presidency has been abolished. But it has not abolished. It has been abolished only in the external representation of the European Union, not in the running of all the Council formations that deal with domestic policy. So he will still be there.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="0804303000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, said that he did not want a cult of celebrity. I pinched myself then when I thought that, in two months&#146; time, the possibly last holder of the rotating presidency, Monsieur Nicolas Sarkozy, is going to become the President of the European Union. If you do not get that point, I shall not go any further. But I think that celebrity is a word that might spring to mind in that context.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="0804303000030"></a>I hope this amendment will not be pursued. I think that giving an external job to the President of the European Council makes sense. If we did not have that, we would have the President of the Commission alone doing it. I cannot believe that that is what those proposing the amendment want. They presumably want the Council and the member states to be in the forefront of all the summit meetings with Russia, China, the United States and so forth. But if they remove the President of the European Union, then they will leave only the high representative, who will be one level down from the President of the Commission in that respect, who will be his president. </p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0804303000031"></a>I do not think that the amendment is very well thought through. Although I would agree that the deconfliction of the jobs of President of the European Council and the high representative will be an important part of the implementation of the treaty once it has been agreed and ratified, I think that, on the whole, the outcome will be a positive one, particularly because, if you think about it, the rotating presidency in the external field no longer makes much sense. There are 27 member states, probably 28 or 29 fairly soon. That means that you get the presidency once every 14 years, with no continuity and with countries such as Malta or Cyprus holding the post. The mind boggles a little bit about all that. There is no external representation anywhere around the world. I do not think that it makes any sense. This change is a timely one. I therefore hope that we will not insist on pursuing the amendment.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has just tried to clarify the role of the President of the European Council, as envisaged, and that of the apparently not-so-high representative for foreign affairs, who is also envisaged. I wonder how the overlap between their roles would be dealt with. As my noble friend Lord Howell said, we have heard much too little about how that will work out in practice.</p>

<a name="80429-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0804303000033"></a>However, I also thought that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, was most helpful in explaining that the permanent President of the European Council is indeed not intended to make the Union more efficient but to make it more effective. That is exactly what I feared. It seems to me that the corollary of the fact that the President of the European Council will be made more effective is that the Heads of Government of the 27 member states will be made less effective. That does not matter for the Heads of Government of the countries that punch below their weight on the world stage, but it does matter for those that punch above their weight on the world stage. Having spent 14 or 15 years working in Japan, I have seen that, in Japanese eyes, the United Kingdom has continually punched above its weight on the world stage. I suspect that the same is true in Korea, China and other countries that I have visited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0804303000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, says that we cannot go on with a rotating presidency involving 27 members. I do not see why we cannot. Indeed, it is important to ensure that we do not have a permanent president because that would make the EU into a country, which means that the United Kingdom would be less effective because it would become less of a country; it would be less clearly seen as such.</p>

In terms of ministerial representation on the European Council, it will mean that the Council will be chaired by the new president rather than by a head of government of one of the participating countries, which has always been a rather strange factor in negotiation because the president of the presiding country has somehow had to be above the political discussions while often coming from a country with strong political views on the subject being considered. The political representation of that country has therefore had to be delegated to a more junior level. Having been a junior Minister, I am not sure that that is necessarily a bad thing, but the new arrangements provide parity between all the participating countries in the European Council in a way that will be helpful in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0804303000040"></a>The noble Lord who has just sat down talked of his concerns about the role of the president, but it seems to me that it is clearly laid down that the president is appointed by, and accountable to, the European Council. Therefore, the president would be speaking on issues, or representing the Council, in those areas where there was an agreed position. I do not see that as a threat to the many areas in which Britain operates independently. It does not represent a threat in all those areas of foreign policy where sometimes, rather sadly, it has not been possible to have an agreed common position. For those reasons, too, we should welcome what is being proposed on practical grounds, rather than be alarmed about it on the grounds mentioned a few minutes ago.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="0804303000041"></a>Finally, I notice that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, in speaking to his amendment, praised Switzerland greatly. Switzerland was, I think, the last democracy to introduce votes for women, as late as 1971, and for that reason I could not go along with all his comments. I have to say, too, that the European Union has been very much a champion of women&#146;s equality and women&#146;s rights in all the directives that it has put forward since it came into being. For that reason as well, even though I like Switzerland, I have doubts about the examples that he used. I hope that the amendment will not succeed and I welcome the provision in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0804303000043"></a>I intervene briefly to say how much I support my noble friend&#146;s amendment. I found the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, very revealing, because he is looking at this from the perspective of creating an entity. My noble friend Lord Trenchard said that to create a presidency was to view Europe as a country and not as a set of nation states. I think that what my noble friend Lord Howell said about celebrity was not a flippant point. If we create a president who represents the Community externally, especially if it turns out to be President Blair, he would use that office and all his talents to become a figure on the world stage. What I find difficult about the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is that, on the one hand, we have to give up many of our vetoes, because apparently it is impossible to get agreement when you have such a large number of member states forming the Community, but, on the other hand, apparently it is okay to have a president representing the views of the Community externally that somehow are going to be agreed magically without having that requirement.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0804303000044"></a>I think of the crises that have beset us of late. I personally opposed the invasion of Iraq, but I wonder, if we had a world figure, a president of Europe, representing our views, quite how he would have managed the chaos that we saw in Europe at the time of the invasion of Iraq. We can think back to the Falklands and many other examples of where it has not been possible for Europe to form a view. The serious point that I want to make is that this is yet another example of the elite in Europe trying to force the pace of political integration too quickly. If it does that, it will damage the Union.</p>

However, he must be aware that external policy&#151;the CFSP, or common foreign and security policy&#151;is still an intergovernmental matter and therefore has to be decided by unanimity.</p>

There is a contradiction here. On the one hand, we have the idea that we have all to surrender our vetoes to get agreement with so many member states; on the other, we must have this new figure to represent Europe&#146;s view, which will apparently be easily achieved by unanimity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0804303000047"></a>I used the examples of the Falklands and the invasion of Iraq to show that it is extremely difficult to get agreement. If you create an international figure whose role it is to explain that he has nothing to say because there is no agreement, that will damage Europe&#146;s standing in the world. Where there is dissent within the Community, member states will see the institution failing to represent their views and that will be damaging to the Community, whereas the current system has the advantage that no one is able

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0804303000048"></a>We should listen to the wise words of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, is not in his place, but I will long cherish his statement that devolution would kill nationalism stone dead. The idea was that, by creating a First Minister and a body, nationalism would stay in its place. The noble Baroness the Leader of the House is giving me a look that says, &#147;Aren&#146;t you getting a bit wide here?&#148;. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, spoke about creating an institution or a position. I give as an example not just the present Scottish First Minister, who is a nationalist, but his Labour predecessor, who decided to have his own foreign policy. We had an aid programme to Malawi; I think that he has now become the high commissioner to Malawi. The Parliament takes more and more powers. The role of First Minister has been developed way beyond even the functions of the Secretary of State in the old days. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, is quite right: once you create a post of this kind, it will develop its own momentum and create tensions and divisions within the Community. Those who support the European Union, who are perhaps more ambitious than I would be for its role, would do well to recognise that they are sowing the seeds of the destruction of the institution that they wish to support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0804303000049"></a>The criticism made by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, of my noble friend&#146;s amendments and what is done in another place would carry more weight if he and his party had put down any amendments whatever in this debate, particularly on what his leader said this week on the &#147;Today&#148; programme that he longed to have debated. Why has it not been put down? I think that we know the answer to that.</p>

He expressed the hope that it would be a long debate. I have not quite shared that hope and I am conscious that I am intervening rather close to the end of the debate, but I would not like the balance to be struck as it has been up to now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0804303000051"></a>A number of speakers have indicated that opposition to this proposal rests on the hope that the Council will not work. That was explicitly stated by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart; it has just been stated by implication by the noble Lord who has resumed his seat. I can understand these sorts of amendments being tabled and discussed by those who want to destroy the effectiveness of the Union. The candour of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, is welcome in revealing what this is all about. It is an attempt to wreck the Union, dressed up with constitutional niceties and doubts about how the office might develop.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0804303000052"></a>The actuality is that the Union has not, throughout its history, punched according to its weight.

If the Union has a view, which is arrived at by unanimity in the Council, is it not desirable that that view be represented effectively overseas? Is it not appropriate to have somebody who

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0804303000053"></a>Some of the odder things that I have encountered in the Select Committee&#151;I have to say that it has been a very interesting experience; it has been a great privilege to serve on it&#151;have been the reports that have come from the country that has been occupying the presidency for six months, in which we have had reports on presidential priorities often with an attempt to indicate some particularity of view by the six-month incumbent. This is about seeking to ensure that the presidency represents the views of the Union, arrived at by unanimous agreement and not by a sort of ducking and weaving around particular interests of a transient president who feels that his or her country has to be given its place in the sun while this is going on.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0804303000054"></a>We have to recognise that, if we belong to this organisation and it is to be more than a charade on the international stage, we need the kind of continuity that this office will help to provide. We need the kind of continuing heavyweight work from a chairman who can pull together the priorities on an ongoing basis, following the lead of the Council.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0804303000055"></a>I do not find it easy to accept the argument made by the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that the larger the grouping of nations, the more important it is not to have a leader. That is like saying that a company that is global in its operations should not have a chairman. The initiative, which was taken by the British Government in this respect, in the Convention on the Future of Europe, of which I had the honour to be a member, along with the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, was very properly directed towards removing one of the weaknesses of the constitutional arrangements that still exist. I am glad that the British Government were successful in persuading others of the importance of the measure that was taken. I very much hope that this amendment will now disappear and not trouble your Lordships&#146; House any more.</p>

<a name="0804303000056"></a><a name="80429-0015.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80429-0015.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0804303000104"></a>Lord Willoughby de Broke:</b> Like the noble Lord, Lord Howell, I agree with the amendment. Why do we need this long-serving, long-time president? That was answered in a sense by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who made a Jesuitical point about efficiency and effectiveness. Well, it depends how you define those two words, but it seems to me, and to others in our position, that the European Union has been perfectly effective or efficient enough already, both on the national and international stage, with a rotating presidency.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0804303000057"></a>I do find it rather odd, again picking up on something that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said&#151;I hope I have not misunderstood him&#151;that it would relieve the burdens on smaller countries, such as Cyprus and Malta, not to have a presidency or to be a long way down the line to have a presidency. That seems to me extraordinary. All the federalists make great play about equality of nations and what a wonderful brotherhood this is, yet it seems to me that there is a first and a second division&#151;those who will have the presidency and those who will not have it.  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_220"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Surely, it is much more sensible, if you are to have this figure, that he should remain short-term and that the presidency should be rotating and go around all the nations, even if they have it only every 14 years. That would not be terribly onerous. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, is absolutely right: this is naked empire-building. It is giving the European Union a presence on the world stage which it fears that it may not have at the moment, with a rotating president. Personally, I think that it is a very good thing from the point of view of our party&#151;but be that as it may.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0804303000058"></a>I move on to another point that has not been raised in this debate. I sincerely hope that we do not have a long-term president of the EU with all the trappings. I do not give any particular credence to this, but I have heard that the president will be salaried, have a house and staff, have a helicopter or two and several limos. We do not know about that; that is by the by; but the position is being built up. But if the EU is going to be a figure in the world&#151;and it is obviously the design that it should have a position on the world stage&#151;can I ask the Minister or her proxy what the position would be of Her Majesty the Queen, relative to the president of the European Union? We are a member state and Her Majesty the Queen is under the Maastricht treaty a citizen of the European Union. I wonder how or if her constitutional role would change, under these arrangements. Who would receive ambassadorial credentials? Who would represent Great Britain at international conferences, or at any international event in which the European Union might have a role and the United Kingdom might be separately represented? Would it affect her role as head of the Commonwealth, for instance?</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0804303000059"></a>I ask those questions simply for information. It is important that we get some answers during these debates, whether now or at a later stage. The noble Baroness, Lady Quin, said that she was rather dubious about Switzerland&#146;s credentials as a democracy because it had denied votes to women for such a long time. Well&#151;that is Swiss democracy. There was a referendum in the local canton of Appenzell, where they voted against having the representation of women. It may be reprehensible, but that is what happened; that is what they wanted. They changed their minds and now women are fully represented, of course. The Swiss have a terrific representative democracy. They have referendums on almost everything. There is almost perhaps too much representative democracy there, as the Swiss sometimes say. But, of course, that is a happy position to be in, when you have too much democracy. In the EU we have much too little.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0804303000060"></a>I therefore support wholeheartedly the amendment of my noble friend Lord Howell and look forward to having one or two of the questions that I put, particularly on the monarchy, answered this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0804303000062"></a>Unusually in this debate, I join in agreement with a remark made by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. When referring to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, he said that it was revealing. Indeed it was. It is the first speech that totally revealed what this part of the treaty is about. It was revealing and helpful and stands in contradiction to many of the other speeches made in the debate so far.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0804303000063"></a>I wanted to address one or two comments to the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. He asserted with absolute confidence that the smaller states do not want this measure. I wonder, therefore, how on earth it ever got into the treaty. Were they deceived or were they all so stupid that they did not understand what they were doing, or did they actually support the proposition? Those are rhetorical questions, so I hope that noble Lords will not feel that they have to answer them. I am amazed by the noble Lord&#146;s remarks. He went on to make a remark that immediately reminded me of my noble friend Lord Hogg of Cumbernauld, who has not been able to be with us for just over a year due to ill health. However, I am sure that if he were here and had heard the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, describe this measure as a pig in a poke, he would have stood up with the same alacrity that he displayed when, as a committee chairman, he replied to Mr Dennis Canavan in the other place when the latter accused him of trying to sell the committee a pig in a poke. My noble friend Lord Hogg pointed out to him that while there was a Hogg in the chair there would be no references to pigs in pokes or anywhere else. As soon as I hear the phrase &#147;pig in a poke&#148; I remember my noble friend Lord Hogg, as I do today.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0804303000064"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, also made an important point. He said with great confidence to my noble friend Lord Sewel, who made an intervention, that, unlike the president of the Council, the president of a cricket club does not send ambassadors here, there and everywhere. However, the president of the Council will not be doing that either. The full-time, or longer term, president of the Council will have nothing to do with the external action service either in terms of its employment or deployment. Its deployment will be the responsibility of the Commission, particularly as regards the high representative. It will certainly not be a personal service at the disposal of whoever happens to be the president of the Council.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0804303000065"></a>With those few words I echo the view expressed by a number of speakers. I hope that this amendment is withdrawn so that we can get on to ones of more substance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0804303000067"></a>I have one question for the Minister, which I think undermines the position taken by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, and others. Since the rejection of the constitution by the French and Dutch people, does she accept that the pace and speed of European law-making has gone up by 25 per cent? The requirement for unanimity was no barrier to this increased speed of law-making, which occurred because laws were easily validated, as is generally accepted.</p>

<a name="80429-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0804303000068"></a>So why do we need this new treaty? We did not need the constitution and we certainly do not need this new president. That is the question and I would be very happy to receive an answer.</p>

I have received a letter from Open Europe about the issue of its briefing, mentioned last time, in which it pointed out that there was an article in a newspaper. I have to say that I was looking for more authoritative sources. I will look at who wrote the article; I, too, can read it in the original French and we shall see where these debates take us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0804303000074"></a>Let me respond to the amendment by being clear on where we began our discussions on the purpose of the treaty. It related to the question of how we managed a European Union of 27 nation states, with a possibility of that number growing by one, two or possibly more, and made ourselves as effective as we possibly could, not only between ourselves as nation states, but on the world stage. I accept&#151;and noble Lords have not made much of this, but it was an important element of the debate in another place&#151;that the three presidencies working together, including the presidencies to come, have been important elements in making sure that there has been synergy, collaboration and continuity between those who have had the privilege of serving on the Council of Ministers in relation to all the aspects of European work and those who have chaired them together and thought through the continuity of what we do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="0804303000075"></a>As a former justice Minister during the UK&#146;s presidency who has had the privilege of chairing several Justice and Home Affairs Council meetings, I firmly believe that there is a real issue that we have to think about. We have been clear in the UK that it is a good move to think about the creation of a new full-time president of the European Council, because we have in Europe a strategic agenda which national prime ministers and presidents set for the European Union. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, rightly says that there are occasions when there is disagreement between member states. The role of the president is to be a functionary of the Council. The president is not making policy but rather representing the European Union on the world stage.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="0804308000003"></a>I looked back at the relations between the European Union and Russia, a country which was discussed earlier in our debates for different reasons. While Mr Putin was President of Russia, he met 16 different European leaders in their role as EU President&#151;beginning with Portugal in May 2000, interestingly, running through the gamut of European countries and ending up with Portugal again in October 2007. Those who have the good fortune to chair the European Council are also running their own countries and have their own priorities as national Presidents or Prime Ministers. They arrive to take over the mantle from a President or Prime Minister before them and try to continue a debate which is often at a critical stage or are in the middle of deep negotiations with another member state. From my small and irrelevant experience of chairing the Justice and Home Affairs Council, I know that just when I had got to grips with things, I handed over the

That does not matter on those councils where three presidencies are working together on issues that are beneath the strategic issues, looking at the role of the European Union on the global stage. However, it does matter when you are thinking about how to make sure that you have continuity in dealing with global issues. I believe that for an individual to represent the views where we have consensus between 27 member states for two and a half years plus two and a half years, and no longer, is a sensible solution.</p>

<a name="0804308000005"></a><a name="80429-0016.htm_spnew3"></a><b><a name="80429-0016.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0804308000075"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> The noble Lord makes a very important point. First, those discussions would largely be held between the energy Ministers working together on the appropriate Council of Ministers with the appropriate opposite number in Russia. When it came to the big strategic discussions, if there was not unanimity of agreement between the 27 member states, the President would not be able to represent a single view, and that is as it should be. We are not arguing that this person should start to make policy. The noble Lord shakes his head. I understand that that feels rather odd but it is no different from the present situation, with a rotating presidency every six months. Flawed though it may feel to the noble Lord as a strategic approach, it is the way forward in representing 27 member states where you need clear agreement on a particular policy. Rather than investing in an individual for a very short time, one is investing in an individual for a longer time. If that individual is regarded as a success, they can continue for a little longer and one gets continuity in negotiations. From his time as a Minister, the noble Lord will understand that continuity is an issue that is constantly faced. The principle behind that should be recognised by your Lordships&#146; House and by this Committee in particular.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="0804308000006"></a>That is, for me, the fundamental argument behind why this is such a sensible and straightforward proposition. It is not about glorifying individuals; it is about effectiveness and the ability to represent properly and see things through with a sense of continuity, which we cannot do at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="0804308000007"></a>Members of the Committee referred to the Blue Book again and I have had a letter from the author. None the less, I believe that what is said at the beginning of the book is incorrect. I shall not go into that in greater detail now, because I want to discuss it with the author. I am in no way suggesting that there is something fundamentally wrong with the book. As I said in our previous discussion, it was because I could not understand why noble Lords, faced with what is in the treaty, could reach a different conclusion that I went back to as many references as I could to see whether they might have read something that is still, in my view, inaccurate. I have asked for advice. I will not go further because I want to meet the author&#151;I have met him before&#151;and I do not want to say anything more until then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="0804308000008"></a>It is very important to consider how valuable someone in that position might be. The noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, asked specific questions about the role of Her Majesty the Queen. I want to be absolutely clear. Her role is completely unchanged. The constitutional position is unchanged. Representation for the UK would be, as appropriate, Her Majesty or the Prime Minister. Nothing is changed by the treaty or anything within it. I hope that that puts the noble Lord&#146;s fears and concerns at rest.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="0804308000009"></a>In the end, this is a debate between noble Lords who are concerned to see in the treaty ways in which they fear the growth and development of the European Union and those who see the treaty as an opportunity to develop the European Union, retaining what is rightly ours as a nation state but collaborating effectively together and finding new structures to take that forward. I sit firmly at the latter end of the spectrum. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

They are looking, in the words of the noble Baroness, for &#147;a strategic global agenda&#148; and a representative who can lead on that: this near-permanent president, someone who can hob-nob with the United States President and the President of Russia and can answer the telephone when Henry Kissinger rings up for one number, as he once claimed he did when he wanted to find out European external policy. That always seemed to me a particularly absurd ambition, because when you ring Washington, you get about 10 different views of foreign policy there. Why he should think that we could unify in Europe, I do not know. The answer is that we cannot. We can unify on some things in practical ways, in coalitions of groupings of European nations, and we do so, but we do not need the rigidifying and codifying of this under new laws and new treaties and a central figure, who would inevitably become the celebrity&#151;the Mr Europe&#151;whose views were taken to be the views of Europe as a whole, where they could be formulated.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="0804308000011"></a>I agree very strongly with my noble friend Lord Trenchard that in this modern, networked world, blocs are yesterday&#146;s idea. Gathering together in some bigger grouping&#151;or scrum, as it were&#151;is not the way forward for a country such as this with all its historic abilities, qualities and skills in negotiating the chopping and changing of foreign policy with the complete changes in the centre of power and economic gravity that are taking place, which make our links with Asia as important as our links with our nearby neighbours in Europe. So there is an important deeper division. The noble Baroness's persuasive explanation does not convince me that that hers is the right way forward. This also damages the position of smaller countries. They may have signed up to the treaty&#151;some have, but there has been a lot of grumbling. If the rotating system is to end, they will be cut out of the scene at the highest level for a time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="0804308000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roper, took me to task about the definition of who was and who was not on the Council. I think that he was probably right, because he is very well informed on these things, but it does state in the treaty:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="0804308000066"></a>&#147;The European Council shall consist of the Heads of State or Government of the Member States, together with its President and the President of the Commission. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy shall take part in its work&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0804308000062"></a>That may not make him a full-time member, but he is there, taking part in the work of the European Council, as well as being the vice-president of the Commission. That is blurring the international and the supranational in ways that are very dangerous for the future. If we are blind to that, we will be blind to a lot of trouble in future.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="0804308000013"></a>There was also an intervention, again from the noble Lord, Lord Roper, about CFSPs, a no-go area for qualified majority voting. That has been asserted by the Government and it is claimed in the treaty. I think we will be able to prove without challenge in later amendments that that simply is not so and that the CFSP is exposed to QMV arrangements in Article 32&#151;I think it is renumbered as Article 17(2)&#151;where the new Foreign Minister can bring forward decisions for QMV in the Council. There are 10 other areas where QMV also comes into foreign policy issues. Do not let us be quite so certain, as some people seem to be, that QMV is out of CFSP and that it is in an area where our veto is maintained. It is not.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="0804308000023"></a>This concerns the new voting arrangements in the treaty, about which there has been a certain amount of black smoke. The Government has asserted that our voting influence will increase as result of the treaty. This is such a partial account as to be positively misleading. What the treaty actually does is to increase countries&#146; power to pass measures but to reduce their power to block them. This is a crucial distinction that has not been adequately recognised in debates, either inside or outside Parliament.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="0804308000024"></a>Under the system agreed at Nice, EU laws presently have to pass three hurdles: 74 per cent of the weight of votes in the Council plus 62 per cent of the population and a majority of member states. Under the treaty there will be just two hurdles: 65 per cent of the population and 55 per cent of the member states. The highest hurdle has therefore been taken away, making it easier to pass legislation. This is what people must mean when they talk about streamlining decision making.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="0804308000025"></a>These changes will make it harder to block legislation. Germany will be the only large member state whose power to do so would remain roughly the same. The London School of Economics has gone to the trouble of doing the arithmetic. I hope they have got it right. They quantify the UK&#146;s loss of blocking power at 30 per cent.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="0804308000026"></a>As with so much of the Lisbon treaty, the new voting system is taken directly from the Constitution with the difference that it will now not come into force until five years after the rest of the treaty comes into force, in other words not until November 2014. Europe would not be Europe without a thicket of almost impenetrable detail, but I will spare your Lordships the complex interim arrangements up to March 2017 and the various exceptions and deadlock-breaking compromises in the text. These are a sideshow to the main point that stopping unwanted laws will become more difficult. Originally, and we have heard this before too, the Government were against the new system. Peter Hain said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="0804308000068"></a>&#147;We see no need to revise the deal made at Nice&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0804308000063"></a>But somewhere along the line our objection was dropped.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="0804308000027"></a>Why should we be more concerned about blocking legislation than about passing it? The answer is straightforward. The Union is already producing too much regulation and it is too difficult to repeal it. A recent poll of 1,000 UK chief executives found that more than half of them thought that the benefits of  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_228"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the single market are now outweighed by the costs of EU regulation. That is an absolutely shocking result, but perhaps of little surprise to those of us who spend our days in business and away from Westminster and Whitehall. In fact, you could not walk into a small firm, charity or community centre without finding a similar level of resentment at the unending flow of EU rules, admittedly often gold-plated domestically. The latest edition of the<I> Laws of England</I> has doubled to 100 volumes, with most of the new laws, according to the editor, coming from Europe.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="0804308000028"></a>According to the British Chambers of Commerce, EU regulation introduced since 1997 has cost British firms &#163;40 billion, nearly three-quarters of the cost of all regulation introduced since that date. So making it even easier for Brussels to churn out laws seems extremely unwise. I shall give a couple of specific examples. The UK is currently blocking the removal of our exemptions from the working time directive. We are also resisting the temporary agency workers directive. Our ability to defend our position in the Council, particularly on the second directive, is fragile, and under the new system it would probably collapse altogether. In boom times we can just about live with all these impositions, but in difficult times we become more acutely aware of the drip-drip of business going elsewhere and of companies and wealth producers packing their bags for more competitive economic climates. The Financial Services Action Plan is costing the City &#163;14 billion to implement. That was bad enough when the financial sector was flourishing a year or two ago, but today it is a heavy blow after Northern Rock and the liquidity crunch.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="0804308000029"></a>As well as reducing our ability to stop legislation, the Lisbon treaty would also hinder our ability to amend it as it goes through the Council by using the weapon of our blocking power to improve draft laws and head off protectionism. Some of the more unacceptable proposals in the directives on financial instruments, prospectuses, consumer credit and transparency were only removed by the UK and other liberal member states through combining our potential blocking vote and threatening to use it. There are important regulations still in the pipeline, such as the Solvency II regulation on insurance, and it is almost inevitable that there will be a legislative response to the credit crisis. In both cases, the UK will be affected disproportionately, given the City&#146;s pre-eminence in the financial sector. It is therefore all the more important to be able to stop ill-judged laws.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="0804308000030"></a>Climate change regulation is another area of some concern. The emissions trading scheme and the biofuel targets are both deeply flawed. Some in the House today have called them a disaster. Now there is talk in France of jacking up EU farm tariffs on climate-related grounds. As the <I>Financial Times</I> pointed out yesterday, Monsieur Barnier&#146;s proposals are very dangerous. The consequences of our being unable to block agricultural protectionism are very alarming for impoverished African farmers.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="0804308000031"></a>The line is that without the treaty, the Union will grind to a halt. There is no evidence whatever to support this assertion. The EU of 27 member states has proved to be a more prolific legislative machine than the EU of 15. Members tonight have already

The voting system introduced by the Lisbon treaty is therefore unnecessary. Indeed, it is worse than unnecessary. It risks negating the liberalising reform agenda in Europe that this country has so long stood for. I beg to move.</p>

When the noble Lord came before the Select Committee to give us evidence, we were pleased when he told us that it was hard to object to the principle of recognising population in the voting system. Indeed, we were so pleased with that remark that we quoted it at paragraph 4.56 of our report.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="0804308000033"></a>On the more substantive issue to which the noble Lord referred&#151;the weight of the United Kingdom in the new voting system&#151;there are two points to be made. As to building up a majority&#151;and we are normally in the majority&#151;our weight will go up from 8 per cent to 12 per cent, so we will have 50 per cent more weight when we are trying to build up a majority to get something agreed. When we come to blocking, there is a dispute. The noble Lord is quite right. Open Europe, in its report, states that the UK stands to lose nearly 30 per cent of its ability to block EU legislation in the Council. On the other hand, others, including the Government, consider that the UK&#146;s share of a blocking minority will increase from 32 per cent to 35 per cent. Therefore, there is a dispute on this matter. I happen to accept the views of the Government, which were supported by others.</p>

<a name="80429-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="0804308000034"></a>There is another point. At the moment, it is necessary to have only three member states in order to have a blocking minority. That is increased under the treaty to four member states, which could be argued to disadvantage us in some way. However, we were impressed when a former British representative to the European Union, Sir Stephen Wall, told us that the current minimum of three member states to form a blocking minority was a mistake, because it is not often that we are in league with two other large member states in wanting to block something. He did not think that the minimum of four would be significant in terms of undermining the British ability to block. I do not believe that the changes in the Lisbon treaty in this respect are significant and, therefore, I do not believe that this amendment deserves support.</p>

We encountered what is affectionately known as the Lazarus system. We were reliably informed that a whole series of directives that would have impacted on the UK&#146;s competitiveness were dead and buried. We had not realised that it was perfectly possible for them to be revived, so we knew these directives as the Lazarus directives. Some of them have been quoted by my

They indeed impact on our competitiveness. We have to consider the jewel in our crown of financial services and the pre-eminence of the City of London. The idea of the more legislation, the better can run directly counter to our national interest.

I am led to understand that this is the first amendment that he has moved in this House; to do so at 10 minutes to 10 after a long, heavy day of Committee work demands more than is usually required. I congratulate the noble Lord, although I shall not agree with him. I hope that that does not come as too much of a disappointment or surprise to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="0804308000037"></a>His amendment would exclude the provisions in the Lisbon treaty that set out the new double majority voting system from having any effect in UK law. To us, this a key institutional reform introduced by the treaty and one which means that decision-making will become fairer, reflecting more accurately the relative population sizes of the member states and, at the same time, increasing the UK&#146;s voting weight.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80429-0017.htm"/>


<a name="80429-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="0804308000038"></a>We believe that the new system will ensure more effective decision-making in the enlarged EU. As it is based on population, surely it is more transparent and fairer than the current QMV system. As has already been said by the noble Lord, Lord Roper, our share of the votes in the Council of Ministers will rise substantially from 8.4 per cent&#151;that is, 29 votes out of 345 under the incredibly complex Nice system&#151;to 12.3 per cent.</p>

<a name="80429-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="0804308000039"></a>The treaty of Lisbon updates the EU&#146;s institutional structure to reflect the fact that the EU now has 27 member states and faces new global challenges and opportunities. Frankly, effective co-operation in the EU will be essential in meeting those challenges. The treaty updates the EU&#146;s institutional structure in a number of different ways, and we have discussed some of them tonight. That structure was designed for a different era and we believe that the changes will enable Europe to act more effectively. It is in our country&#146;s interest to see more effective decision-making in areas such as energy, the environment and counterterrorism. It is not in our interest to see gridlock as an EU of 27 becomes, it is hoped, even larger in the future.</p>

<a name="80429-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="0804308000040"></a>While considering the merits of a voting system, we have to bear in mind that a single member state is only as strong as the coalition of which it is a part. The benefits, or otherwise, to the UK depend as much on the change to the strengths of other countries as to the UK. By way of example, Germany, which was referred to by the noble Lord, will, as the largest member state by some margin, be the biggest beneficiary of the move to a voting system based on population. Thus, in votes where the UK and Germany are on the  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_231"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column 231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>same side&#151;as we tend to be, for example, on budgetary issues&#151;DMV is in the UK&#146;s interest not only because our vote increases but also because the German vote increases too.</p>

<a name="80429-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="0804308000041"></a>Under the new system, it will be simpler to update the voting weights if and when new member states join. Because we will have in place a system based essentially on population, rather than prescribing each country a specific number of votes, we will not need to renegotiate the system every time a new country joins. That could be particularly important as Croatian accession moves closer. It is part of a sensible updating of the institutional framework of the Union to equip it to act more effectively in pursuit of shared interests.</p>

<a name="80429-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="0804308000042"></a>It has been alleged by some&#151;the noble Lord referred to this&#151;that double majority voting would reduce our blocking power. I have seen figures, and they have been mentioned today, suggesting that our blocking power would be reduced by some 30 per cent. Those figures are discredited. Those who used them quoted from a paper published by academics at the London School of Economics in June 2004. One of the authors of the paper, Professor Machover, has made it clear to us that, in his view, under the new voting system the UK&#146;s relative position will substantially improve. The Select Committee, under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, who is in his place, concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="0804308000069"></a>&#147;The new system for calculating a qualified majority is more equitable and takes more account of population than the current QMV rules, and the revision is significant&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0804308000064"></a>The committee also repeated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="0804308000070"></a>&#147;The UK&#146;s voting weight increases from 8 per cent to 12 per cent&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80429-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="0804308000043"></a>Finally, we have analysed situations where the UK has recently been in blocking minorities on sensitive issues, such as on the soil directive, the payment services directive, the 2008 Community budget and the European fisheries fund. In each and every case, I am advised that we would have also been in a comfortable position to defend our interests under these new rules.</p>

<a name="80429-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="0804308000044"></a>We step, then, into the field of qualified majority voting. I hope that the Committee will agree that it is really too late to start a debate on that&#151;on its virtues or otherwise&#151;tonight. However, if there are members of the Committee against qualified majority voting in principle, it is important to remember that the first use of it was in the treaty of Rome; it was extended further by the Single European Act. The Government recognise, as we did at Nice&#151;and as our predecessors did in the Single European Act, and at Maastricht, which followed it&#151;that, as the Union grows in size, decision-making by unanimity can become more difficult. QMV can make that easier.</p>

<a name="80429-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="0804308000045"></a>The example, of course, is that the single market could never have been built, nor would much legislation have been passed on, for example, the environment, market liberalisation or reform of the common agricultural policy, without QMV. With the greatest of respect, I will quote the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, who said in this House, long ago now, in 1993:</p>

I have sat through many Committee stages in this House and I have never known such self-indulgence from Members on the opposition Front Bench, who have toured so many horizons in their interventions and given vent to so many old prejudices.

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="0804308000054"></a>The Minister returned to the question of effectiveness, a theme which has been raised quite often today.

<p><a name="08042990000012"></a>The noble Lord said: I need not detain the Committee long on this amendment because from the moment the issue of pay was raised with Ministers, it was clear that they were already on the case. Indeed, a strong rumour, on which I could not comment, says that they have their man&#151;or woman&#151;for the job. They certainly would not have done that if they had not persuaded themselves that something had to be done on the pay front. As I say, I expect that the Minister will be forthcoming and I shall not detain the Committee long.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000013"></a>The pay issue matters not just because of the pounds, shillings and pence in someone's pocket, which they may or may not need, but because it is a symbol of the importance of the job and the amount of responsibility that goes with the job. Thank God, I will not have to do it. I think it would have been seriously misunderstood in the sector if a good fight had not been put up for decent pay to go with the job. I do not believe that I need to say any more until the Committee has had a chance to hear the Minister.</p>

Irrespective of any personalities or any individual job, if a job is to be paid at a much higher rate than that at which it has already been advertised, I understand that under the Government&#146;s own rules&#151;certainly those rules that they supply to charities which receive grants from them&#151;that job would have to be readvertised. I hope that that will be looked at. If someone has already been selected and will be paid more without the job being readvertising, some quite serious questions could be asked.</p>

My response has usually been, &#147;Not at that rate of pay, if you have any sense&#148;. If someone has been lined up and if this is to be done without further advertising, how do the Government know what they have missed? I can assure the Minister that there are a number of people who have not come forward because of the way in which that job was advertised originally and at the salary at which it was advertised.

No one wants to delay unnecessarily the appointment of a new chair, but if the Government do finger someone&#151;I know that Governments of all parties have been known from time to time to finger people for these difficult tasks and encourage them to apply for particular jobs&#151;or that has been done, there is a process issue to which the Government ought to give some thought.</p>

At Second Reading, I promised that I would look at this as many noble Lords expressed concern. I can confirm that the Appointments Commission has conducted an independent recruitment exercise based on the advert that the noble Lord referred to and made a recommendation to the Secretary of State. As the Secretary of State announced in January, he intends to invite the Health Select Committee to hold a hearing to enable the pre-appointment scrutiny of the Government&#146;s preferred candidate before making his final decision. I expect an announcement to be made tomorrow lunchtime on this next stage of the appointments process. I will write to noble Lords at the time of the announcement.</p>

I would like to make clear that the Appointments Commission has acknowledged and apologised for the inappropriate placements in the newspaper and on the website. As part of the current recruitment process, the Appointments Commission arranged for the advert to be rerun the following week in more suitable positions in print and online.</p>

One of the principal concerns that I raised at our last Sitting was not the level of remuneration for this post but the requirements of the job, particularly for the chair, which paid no attention whatever to the fact that this person had to have an understanding and experience of local government and social care. I am an avid reader of Wednesday&#146;s <I>Guardian</I> and I have been looking deeply into the far more interesting post of chief executive of the CQC, which was advertised a week or so ago. In that advert, it is clear that the Government have paid some attention to points raised by noble Lords, although not enough in my view. It mentions the need for the person to have an understanding of local government and to know what a comprehensive area assessment is. However, nothing the Minister has said has allayed my fears that this recruitment process, as it has been outlined, is heavily

The fact that the Health Select Committee will go through the pre-appointment process offers scant hope that that in itself will be rectified. I hope that when the Minister responds more fully he will pick up that point which, for some of us, is by far the most important.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000028"></a><a name="80429-gc0001.htm_spnew22"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0001.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="08042990000388"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> I put my name to these amendments and I am moved to get to my feet because I have not yet heard anything to suggest that the Minister has fully taken their force with regard to the salary at which the position is to be remunerated. As things stand, the post looks as if it has been downgraded when compared with current arrangements for the remuneration of the chairs of CSCI and the Healthcare Commission. I have a raft of statistics relating to the different rates at which chairs of public sector bodies are paid, but it would be otiose to weary the Committee with them. Suffice it to say that there seems to be neither rhyme nor reason to them. There is no discernible pattern. Some seem to be paid at one rate and others at another, although they may have lesser budgeting responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000029"></a>It is difficult to discern a pattern, but one thing is discernible. This post of shadow chair&#151;as we are now to call it&#151;of the CQC is, according to the advertisement, to be remunerated at a rate markedly below the level at which either the CSCI chair or the chair of the Healthcare Commission is remunerated. That looks like a downgrading in my book. I understand that the Minister is to make an announcement tomorrow, but it would reassure the Committee if he were able in responding to give some indication that he has taken on board the concerns raised by the Committee about the level of remuneration for this very important position.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000030"></a><a name="80429-gc0001.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0001.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="08042990000389"></a>Lord Warner:</b> As a Minister when the present incumbents were taking up posts, it might help if I share with the Committee the benchmark in setting the pay of the chair of the Healthcare Commission. As I recall, that benchmark was the pay of a High Court judge. That was the level of seriousness with which that post was equated. Then there was a comparability issue for the chairman of CSCI.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000031"></a>I say that not because I necessarily think that was the right benchmark, but it gives an indication of the way in which only a few years ago this type of job was viewed by this Government. There is an issue. It is not the Minister&#146;s fault that we are in this situation. It is not too late for the Government to reflect a bit further on consistency in the term of office of this Government and on why we have made this rather dramatic change in five years. Nothing that I have read about the new job suggests that it is in any way not comparable at least with what the present chairman of the Healthcare Commission is paid and with what the present chairman of CSCI is paid. I encourage my noble friend to say to his colleagues, however far down the track they are with particular individuals, that they really need to reflect on  how this is seen and they need to think about consistency of action within the term of office of a Government.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000032"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0001.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="08042990000390"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0001.htm_spnew27"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham</b><b><a name="80429-gc0001.htm_spnew28"></a>:</b> First, let me address the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, about the scrutiny process. I cannot think of a better scrutiny than parliamentary scrutiny, and the Health Select Committee as it stands covers social care and the whole activity of the Department of Health. The shadow chair will be confirmed only once the legislation has passed. That was made clear to the candidate who applied for the post as advertised.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000033"></a>There is no doubt in my mind that the senior leadership of the Care Quality Commission needs to be of a sufficiently high calibre to ensure that it can deliver its statutory functions effectively. The commission will be a powerful new independent organisation responsible for regulating services across the health and social care sectors. It will have significantly greater powers than the current regulators, which it will replace, and it will seek to assure people who use the service and patients that all the services they receive are fair, personal, effective and safe.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000034"></a>We do not believe that the advertised range of the chair&#146;s salary will adversely affect the capability of the new organisation. Let me put the figures into context. The post, which is a part-time, non-executive role, was advertised at the rate of &#163;60,780 for a time commitment of up to three days per week. The advert also made very clear that more was available for an exceptional candidate. The remuneration offered is at the top end of the current Department of Health arm&#146;s-length body pay scales and compares favourably with the salary paid to some other publicly appointed non-executive chairs of regulatory bodies.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000035"></a>A chair&#146;s pay in any organisation must be seen in the context of the planned balance of responsibility between non-executive and executive appointments in the organisation. We expect the new commission to appoint the highest calibre chief executive and other senior executives jointly to realise the vision that the commission creates. I am sure that noble Lords would agree that it is important that we are sensitive to public perception and to general trends in public sector pay with respect to the salary of the new chair. However, we recognise that there is a balance to be struck to attract the right calibre of candidate for the post, and I believe that the advertised salary does exactly that. I therefore ask my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000036"></a><a name="80429-gc0001.htm_spnew29"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0001.htm_spnew30"></a><a name="08042990000391"></a>Lord Lipsey:</b> I had rather hoped for more from the Minister. There is a sort of ambiguity about what he said, because he said what the advertised range was, and then he said that more was available to an exceptional candidate, but he did not say whether a good deal more was going to be paid. I hope that this paragon of a candidate, who will be announced tomorrow, will be such that it must be much more, but we will have to wait and see.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000037"></a>Although I do not wish to persist with the amendment today, we will want to see the colour of the money that the Government are providing for the preferred candidate, and it is within the power of Parliament at a subsequent stage of the Bill to act in line with the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Low, and me, to up  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that package if we think that the Government are so frightened of the public complaining that they are providing an inadequate salary to advertise the importance of the job.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000038"></a>I must admit to another concern that has arisen out of the Minister&#146;s statement; I make no bones about it. This House has not yet agreed that a new regulator should start in office, as proposed by the Government, with the powers set out in the Bill. I moved an amendment the other day&#151;which I withdrew because we do not vote in Grand Committee&#151;to say that it should not happen before 2013. I believe that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is this afternoon proposing that Clause 2 does not stand part of the Bill. I have been in this House a while and we are flexible, reasonable people. The one thing I have found about noble Lords is that they do not like being taken for granted. The Government are announcing this appointment tomorrow, when noble Lords have not yet had a chance to come to a stern and settled view as to whether it should be going ahead. Members of the Committee will want to consider carefully whether the obvious needs for due dispatch in proceeding with this, if the Bill goes through, have been rightly balanced with noble Lords&#146; concerns that these matters should be fully debated and decided by the House before the Government go ahead.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000039"></a>In withdrawing these amendments, I say that those two concerns must be met before we come back to this on Report, at Third Reading and even, perhaps, beyond. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000044"></a>Amendment No. 10 is supported by the National Consumer Council, the Picker Institute and <I>Which?</I>. It aims to put users at the heart of the regulatory process by bringing them into the commission&#146;s governance structures to influence the development of plans, programmes, methodologies and approaches at a formative stage through insider engagement. It is intended to bring patients, users and carers into the formative processes of the commission&#146;s workings.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000045"></a>Current consultation with service users is usually over specific projects or established work patterns when plans or decisions are already well formed, and involves users in inspections or reviews the methodology and approach which have previously  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been formed elsewhere. In other words, users are usually involved relatively late in the day and can seem almost tokenistic.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000046"></a>The amendment would require the commission to set up a panel to oversee the work of the regulator, reaching out to and feeding back from a wide range of user and public views and experiences. It would focus on helping the regulator to carry out its functions, including setting themes and priorities for review, and shaping regulatory processes. The panel should not be dominated by professionals from charities or lobby groups but must ensure strong representation of service users themselves, particularly those who are vulnerable or seldom heard.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000047"></a>What would the amendment achieve? The model for the service user panel is partly informed by the success of Ofcom's consumer panel. A service user panel would be a critical friend to the board and executive. It could comment on the extent to which the interests of service users, families and carers are properly built into the commission's work streams, and influence board planning and strategic direction. It could ensure that methodology development for inspection and review is appropriate to the patient and the user population of the service to be scrutinised, and enable external organisations such as local involvement networks cost effectively to feed their views into the commission.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000048"></a>The Government have said that service users&#146; interests should have a high-level voice in the commission's board and executive, and the advisory committee required by Schedule 1, paragraph 6, is welcome but does not go far enough as it does not ensure the users' voices, rather than those of pressure groups, are heard. This advisory committee seems to be a general committee of all relevant stakeholders with the optional inclusion of service users. The nature, membership, objectives and functions of this committee need to be defined, otherwise the user voice will be only one among many. All the research and experience suggests that when patients&#146; voices are made to compete with other interest groups, they become effectively disempowered. The Government suggested that the proposed advisory committee could, through the way it works, help to make the user voice effective; for example, by enabling sub-committees or establishing meetings between the board and that part of the committee representing other interests.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000049"></a>However, that is not stated in the Bill and, therefore, there are no guarantees that the commission would establish a sub-committee of service users per se. There are precedents. The Mental Health Act Commission has already developed an empowered service user reference panel. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, NICE, has established a citizens&#146; council which can cross-examine witnesses and make recommendations which NICE must consider and respond to. The Children&#146;s Plan from the recently formed Department for Children, Schools and Families sets out proposals for parent councils to ensure that their voices are heard within the school.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000050"></a>The Communications Act 2003 required Ofcom to establish a consumer panel, to which I referred earlier. The Act specified 13 separate subject areas on which the panel should be able to advise Ofcom, including,</p>
<ul><a name="08042990000350"></a>&#147;any other matter appearing to the Panel to be necessary for securing effective protection for persons who are consumers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000303"></a>The Ofcom consumer panel has had significant influence. It is able to request involvement in, and explanation of, Ofcom work plans at the conceptual stage, and to begin providing critical feedback. It is skilled at identifying the consumer impact of Ofcom initiatives and at advising the regulator on how to make them explicit in work. The proposals in both these amendments fit the policy agenda for engaging users in the design and delivery of public services, including a requirement for regulators to engage with service users and the public at large.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000051"></a>I was delighted to welcome the amendment to this amendment&#151;Amendment No. 11&#151;from my noble friend Lady Campbell of Surbiton. Her suggestion neatly ensures that service users are indeed at the heart of the commission. Amendment No. 11 would ensure an effective link between the proposed service user panel and the commission by requiring the Secretary of State to appoint a member of the commission who is a service user to chair the panel. This mirrors the arrangements made for the Equality and Human Rights Commission&#146;s disability committee, which, as stipulated in the Equality Act, must be chaired by a member of its board. That would give service users more direct influence on the commission and thus enhance people&#146;s confidence in CQC's ability to put patients and carers&#146; at the heart of quality assurance. It harnesses the talents of the very people that CQC seeks to help and can improve health and social care outcomes as a result. There is always a danger of the panel merely becoming a talking shop or a body to be consulted after decisions have been taken.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000052"></a>In drafting this amendment, my noble friend Lady Campbell has drawn on her experience of chairing the Social Care Institute for Excellence for five years, where its partner panel is chaired by a trustee, and her experience on the Equality and Human Rights Commission, where she serves as both a commissioner and chair of the disability committee. It is the central seat at the table that ensures the users inform the workings of the commission and see its contribution reflected in its work programme and reports. It protects against any temptation for professionals and practitioners to default back to former ways of working where consultation may be token. The amendment seeks to ensure that service user involvement is enhanced by a strong conduit between the panel and the &#147;top table&#148;, bringing the ideas and knowledge directly into the heart of decision-making and forward planning. I beg to move.</p>

Amendment No. 11 would ensure an effective link between the proposed service user panel and the commission by requiring the Secretary of State to appoint a member of the commission who is a service user to chair the panel. Without this direct line of influence to the commission proper, my fear would be that the impact of a service user panel would be diluted and would not see the effective mainstreaming of users&#146; views and aspirations.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000055"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, pointed out, Parliament was careful to ensure that there was no such risk for the Equality and Human Rights Commission disability committee, which similarly has a direct line into the commission via its chair. User involvement is not just desirable in itself; it leads to better policy-making and improved services. With increasing personalisation on the agenda in both health and social care, it is essential that users are involved at every level of the new organisation. It would be difficult truly to personalise a public service if its regulator had minimal user involvement. I would therefore urge the Minister to accept the case for the provision set out in Amendments Nos. 10 and 11. I beg to move.</p>

As we debated recently in the local government Bill, and as the noble Lord, Lord Low, effectively stressed the other day, there is an important difference between involvement and consultation. It is the difference between allowing someone to contribute to the shaping of plans from the moment that the initial idea is conceived and allowing a person to comment on those plans only once they are fully formed. The two are not at all the same. Surely, we want a group of people to help and advise the commission from the perspective of the informed service user&#151;people who know what it is like on the ground and who can offer their wisdom to the commission in a measured and reasoned way.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000057"></a>I believe that such a panel would be a force for good. It would be the means by which the commission could assure itself that the interests of service users and carers were properly embedded in the work that it undertakes. Leaping ahead to the next but one group of amendments, it would be the ideal conduit for LINks to feed in their views to the commission in a structured and co-ordinated way.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000058"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said, there are some good precedents. For instance, there is the Ofcom consumer panel, which I understand works well and is influential. There is also the citizens&#146; council, set up by NICE, which can make recommendations. Above all, there is the service user reference panel reporting to the Mental Health Act Commission, which in its short existence has undoubtedly proved its value. I would argue that there is no more important sphere for

In that context, we are dealing with people who have many of their rights taken away and who find themselves with a need to feel empowered as far as reasonably possible, and able to influence the way in which they are looked after. Without service user involvement, it would be very easy to imagine a culture developing which failed sufficiently to take that dimension into account.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000059"></a>My understanding is that direct involvement by service users in visiting activity in the context of the Mental Health Act Commission has been shown to have considerable benefits. The Government have often said that they are keen on user involvement in the regulatory process and I accept that they are. I therefore hope that they will look constructively at this amendment.</p>

A moment or two ago, in response to the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, the Minister read out a mind-boggling list of responsibilities with which the chairman of the new organisation would have to deal. Every single one was very wide and very important. In fact, when he said it, I wondered how on earth any person was going to do that three days a week, but that may be something for the future. I am, however, concerned that unless the users are clearly harnessed into this work, the commission will not be working on all the information that should be available to it. Surely only the users can know exactly what is going on on the ground. I have seen with my own eyes allegations made by patients about their treatment being totally ignored and put down by the National Health Service people. Unless we ask the users and listen to what they say in the way in which the amendments suggest, the people in charge of the commission will not be able to carry out what all of us here hope they will be able to carry out.</p>

I intend to speak to a number of amendments later, but will say just a few words about why I support this one.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000062"></a>I have for various reasons spent a large part of my life in hospital&#151;I will not go into details&#151;but I have seen a lot in hospitals. I am a classic user, having on occasions spent months on end in hospital. My mother is in a nursing home and I try to visit her four times a week. You learn a lot about nursing homes, and she is in a good one, but I visited many nursing homes before I placed her in one. It is inconceivable that people who have that kind of experience are somehow to be loosely represented under the advisory committee arrangements that are set out in the Bill and which were referred to some moments ago.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000063"></a>I hope that the Minister, when he replies, accepts that we, the users, are in a particularly difficult position, because most users have no knowledge of healthcare. Most people in a lifetime&#151;I do not know; I have no empirical evidence for this&#151;probably go nowhere near a hospital; only those of us who are less fortunate end up in hospitals. They start off with very little knowledge  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and go into hospital with very little knowledge. Most people out there have no idea what goes on in nursing homes or care homes; only when they enter them do they begin to learn how things operate. They are confronted by people who are highly skilled and highly articulate and who know the business through and through and know how to answer all the questions. Very often they simply do nothing because they are overwhelmed by the abundance of knowledge that they know they must take on in the event that they wish to make a complaint. There must be far more effective representation of users in the structure that is being created.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000064"></a>Furthermore, as we are in effect consolidating efforts in one organisation, and as has been repeated previously, there may well be an emphasis in the work done on areas that do not necessarily encompass areas of social care that might be my preoccupation. I want to see in the structure that is being created a body of people who can more effectively represent the area that may well become the Cinderella part of its functions.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000065"></a><a name="80429-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08042990000397"></a>Baroness Gardner of Parkes:</b> I, too, support the amendment. My experience in the health service and in social care is that people have problems, complaints and unfortunate experiences, but their number one wish is to see that the same thing does not happen to someone else. They are not usually out for compensation; they really just want to see that their experience is not repeated. The user panel would give them the opportunity to see that their feelings and experiences were fed through. This is a very important amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000066"></a><a name="80429-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08042990000398"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> At Second Reading, many noble Lords spoke about the importance of ensuring that patients, people who use social care services and their families and carers are involved in the work of the Care Quality Commission. I hope that I was clear about the importance the Government also attach to that. Many noble Lords have drawn attention to the excellent work of the three current commissions in involving those who use health and adult social care services in their work. I reassure noble Lords that this is something that we are absolutely committed to retaining and carrying forward to the commission.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000067"></a>There is no doubt in my mind that the new commission will be just as user-focused as the current commissions and that it will build on their good work. It is worth remembering that the current bodies are not under any specific legal duty in this regard. The requirement in Clause 2 for the commission to have regard to views expressed by and on behalf of members of the public is therefore a new duty. That will of course include patients and service users and those who represent them, such as LINks. That sets a good foundation for the new commission&#146;s programme of involvement and engagement, which I am sure it will develop.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000068"></a>In terms of having suitable mechanisms for enabling ongoing involvement and commentary on its work, we had sought to establish such a mechanism  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>through the requirement in Schedule 1 to appoint an advisory committee, to whose advice the commission will have to have regard. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, along with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has in Amendment No. 10 made the case for a more specific requirement to have a separate advisory committee comprised solely of patients, service users and their families and carers, to be known as the service user panel.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000069"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, has proposed a further addition to Amendment No. 10, through Amendment No. 11, which would require the commission to appoint one of its members who is or who has recently been a user of health or social care services to chair the service user panel. There is no doubt in my mind that direct experience of services would be very valuable in informing the way in which the commission carries out its work. However, I expressed my concerns when we discussed Amendments Nos. 6 and 9 about seeking to specify what kind of background members of the commission should have. I therefore do not think that we should be prescriptive about this in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000070"></a>As a general point, I emphasise the importance of flexibility in engaging with users and carers. Innovation is key and, as I have mentioned, the Healthcare Commission, the CSCI and the Mental Health Act Commission all engage well with users, using a variety of methods of engagement and involvement. However, I recognise the importance that noble Lords have placed on the CQC having appropriate user involvement and engagement, as very eloquently described by my noble friend. I will, therefore, undertake to consider how we could strengthen the current arrangements for ensuring that the commission has strong public, patient, service user and carer involvement in its work, while maintaining a flexible approach, with a view to reporting back at a later stage of the Bill&#146;s passage. Given that reassurance, I hope that noble Lords will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000082"></a>The noble Baroness said: This afternoon we will debate groups of amendments that follow a theme. The theme for this amendment was to some extent set in the previous debate. My understanding was that in the previous group of amendments the Committee was considering the role of users in the governance of the commission. I believe that is important. Governance is about setting strategy and direction, not about management. However, the amendments in this group and in subsequent groups are about operational matters, which are also important.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000083"></a>I live in a part of London where there are two large hospitals that people who need acute care go to. For some services, probably for most services, people can elect to go to one or the other. As we all know, probably the most elective of elective services is maternity services. I live in an area where there are women who will not set foot in one hospital and swear by the other one, but on the other side of where I live there are women who make the reverse judgment. I have no doubt that if one goes to the mothers and toddlers groups round where I live there are raging debates about the benefits or otherwise of those two hospitals, the basis of which is probably highly subjective. What members of the general public who are not engaged and have no need of those services think is probably based on nothing more than the opinion of the person to whom they last spoke. However, the opinions of users are very different and are formed on a wholly different basis.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000084"></a>When we look at the wording of the Bill, it is important to state quite frankly that the Government are way behind the times. By not putting the views of users first, at the heart and above and beyond the views of the general public, they are way behind the thinking, particularly in the field of social care. Why is that? It is, at least in part, because of a point that I referred to at Second Reading, which is that people who need social care have very few rights in law. I suspect that by the time we are through with this  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legislation the only right that they will be left with will be the right to have information. They are certainly not going to have a right to have services. Particularly in the field of social care, the right of people to be involved at a very high level in decision-making about their personal care and about the management and strategy of services overall has gone on apace, and social care is way in advance of what happens in health. While what is in the Bill at the moment may be a giant leap forward for the NHS, it represents a massive leap backwards for social care. I am afraid that that is not acceptable.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000085"></a>Why is this important? Apart from anything else, the diversity of users is important. People who use mental health services have vastly different experiences and needs from people who intermittently use some low-level social care services. Their views are wholly different from people who go through major acute trauma and receive high-level surgical services. There is also a distinction to be drawn between the needs of people with learning disabilities and, for example, older people. That is not a fashionable thing to say at the moment, not least because much of the underlying policy on development of social care services comes from the learning disability field.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000086"></a>There is a range of different views to be taken into account. It is important that we should not be prescriptive in this legislation about how the commission should go about the business of user involvement. Indeed, I suspect that it would be misguided if we thought that if we were prescriptive about the involvement of any particular body the legislation we ended up writing would be relevant for more than two years&#151;that is the average length of NHS and social care reorganisation. That is why my amendments are in some ways quite unspecific. They do not make suggestions about involving specific bodies, but simply say that there must be mechanisms that ensure that there is engagement with users and the public.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000087"></a>In Amendment No. 108, I again pick the point made by myself and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, in our discussions last week about the fact that we remain convinced that a director of adult services must work within the commission to ensure that adult social care has the proper prominence it will need. That is why we have suggested in Amendment No. 108 that it is a duty to have that part of the commission&#146;s work included in its annual report.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000088"></a>If I were in the shoes of the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, I imagine that I would say that this is otiose. It has taken 40 years for user involvement to become an expectation in social care in any meaningful sense. However, it is not easy and certainly not cheap; it is a deliberate and expensive process. There remains a fear among many that, if it is not backed up in statute, it may simply become a passing phase and, when times get hard, become a luxury which hard-pressed professionals can simply dump. That is why it needs to be in legislation&#151;although I accept that, in stating that it needs to happen, we cannot be overly prescriptive about how it happens. That is the basis of my amendment. I beg to move.</p>

The amendment makes it clear that the term &#147;involve&#148; encompasses the need to provide information about the exercise of its functions and to consult and involve service users, families and carers in the inspection of registered service providers. Although I accept the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that we should not be too specific in the Bill, there are certain functions of the commission where it is so essential to involve service users that there is a strong case for being specific. The only other point in this amendment is that users should be involved in the process of special reviews. Again, I do not think that that will be done properly unless users are involved.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000091"></a>The amendment is supported by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the National Consumer Council, <I>Which?</I> and the Picker Institute. My motivation in tabling it lies in my experience of working very closely with users, families and carers in East London. The health service has for years paid lip service to user involvement. We had community health councils and PPIs, but I cannot recollect anything really different occurring because of consultation with those bodies. Only very recently have we on the front line taken this seriously. We are finding that the real involvement of service users is the fastest and most efficient way to find out what we are doing wrong and how to put it right. I have never known things coming so clearly through to board level about our problems and what we are doing to put them right as is happening now. At last, this is apparently a part of government thinking across wider areas of government policy and I am delighted to hear that. Things will improve faster than we imagine because of that commitment. Yet the Health and Social Care Bill makes no explicit reference, as I am sure other Members of the Committee will point out, to service users, their families and carers.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000092"></a>The most important area as far as this is concerned is that of detaining patients in psychiatric hospitals, which I happen to know little about. The Mental Health Act Commission&#146;s work will now be involved in the CQC. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, mentioned, these patients have their rights taken away. They have treatment without their consent&#151;about the most unpleasant thing, if you really put your mind to it, that can happen to anybody. They are told, &#147;You will have this injection. You don't want it but I can't be too concerned about that. You will have it&#148;. Many of them are not allowed to leave the ward. They are de facto prisoners.

How else could it presume to monitor and assess patient focus? I know all too well that that is one of its core standards.

<p><a name="08042990000094"></a>The Government may ask why we need this amendment if current regulators are doing quite a bit of this already. My response is that the Bill as it stands and government statements reveal confusion between listening to the views of the public on the one hand and involving people, users, carers and families in the provision of services on the other. It is a completely different thing. I acknowledge that the Government's response to the pre-legislative consultation in 2007 was encouraging, referring as it did to involving service users. But in response to continuing debate about this issue, the Minister proposed a government amendment producing the following wording in Clause 2:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000332"></a>&#147;In performing its functions the Commission must have regard to&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000334"></a>&#147;There will be a wide range of bodies with an interest in a particular issue or representing particular groups, and we want to ensure that the commission hears their views. For that reason, Government amendment No. 62 proposes to make it explicit that a duty to have regard to the views of the public includes views expressed by representative bodies on behalf of members of the public&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 18/2/08; col. 77.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000305"></a>Testing public views through organisations representing patients and service users is helpful, but it is not a substitute for involving the patients, service users and families in the process of regulation as proposed in this amendment.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000095"></a>Clause 2(3)(a) simply does not deal with the issue that we are debating here. It goes some way, but it is a long way short. Looking at the history of the health service, I suggest that the Bill as currently drafted details what we have been doing for 40 years. We suggest that we have moved way beyond that, as other Members of the Committee have said. However, the regulator now needs to catch up with what other organisations are doing.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000096"></a>I have also tabled Amendment No. 104. This amendment presents a more limited requirement for CQC inspection teams to include lay inspectors&#151;families, carers, users&#151;in their inspections. This is an alternative, more limited amendment and, in my view, it focuses on the crucial bit, which is the inspections. For me, the crucial point about Amendment No. 27 is that it spells out the absolutely key activities&#151;not just one, but a few others&#151;where service users, carers and families really need to be involved if they are to do a good job. I hope that the Minister will agree with the principle proposed here.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000098"></a>I am encouraged by the Minister's previous expression of openness towards further discussions on the question of service-user, carer and general public involvement, especially in the work of the Care Quality Commission. I have put my name to Amendment No. 27, which I think sets out duties for such involvement in a meaningful way. It is, at least, a great improvement on the Bill's construction as presented, which only requires the CQC to &#147;consider the views&#148; of service users and others. A duty to consider the views of service users may be too easily met by consultation, rather than involvement, as many noble Lords have pointed out. I would want an organisation that is required to have service users at its heart, not on its periphery.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000099"></a>The Minister has previously paid tribute to the Mental Health Act Commission's service-user reference panel, as have other Members of the Committee on a previous amendment. The Mental Health Act Commission has always had service users among its membership, but in recent years it has made particular efforts to involve service users who are or have recently been detained, which has had a huge impact on all aspects of the organisation, not just on the visiting programme. Last week, we published a report which I know has been sent to the Minister.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000100"></a>The involvement of service users is something that everyone is keen on but, if the truth is told, very few organisations do it well. Many do little other than consult their service users. Consultation is, of course, a good start but it does not go far enough; it does not engage people in any meaningful way. In my experience and in the experience of the Mental Health Act Commission, real service-user engagement is very challenging. It involves a huge number of risks that managers and staff have to take. It requires resourcing which includes not only staff time&#151;named individuals who take the work forward&#151;but also sufficient funds to undertake the work. Only when the Mental Health Act Commission has put in those resources and individuals to do that work will a real impact have been made. It requires understanding and commitment from the whole organisation. People need to be trained and they need to own the vision. That should not be an add-on or an extra but at the heart of what it does. It is very challenging and should be underpinned by some systematic and proactive approach. We tend to be very reactive when things happen, but we do not have a systematic approach to dealing with this. They are the key elements of what needs to happen.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000101"></a>The rewards are significant. True engagement with effective service-user and carer involvement enables us to understand who people are in all their complexity. It is a truism, but important none the less, that services would not exist if people did not require help, support and treatment. The service exists for the service user. Sadly, that may not always be obvious, but it is the service user who is the expert, for example, on how it feels to be detained against his or her will; to be denied many things that we might take for granted in our  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>day-to-day lives; to be treated with powerful psychotropic medication. Service-user involvement is not a luxury to be added when we have the basics right. It is the basics. The Care Quality Commission must be able to draw on that experience and expertise, to tailor its visits to those matters that service users themselves identify and to ensure that the civil legal and human rights of patients are upheld at all times.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000102"></a>It is essential to the current government agenda of increasing personal choice and ensuring that services are responsive to individual need and that they start to become user-led. The really important point is that the Care Quality Commission must be a leader in this if it wants to inspect how others develop service user and carer engagement. It needs to set the benchmark. It needs to get its own house in order and show the way forward as regards principles of equality and engagement and inspecting others. For too long, professionals, academics, practitioners and managers have retained sole control of organisational priorities. I would want to see the CQC&#146;s technical commitment to service-user and carer involvement fully on board so that this becomes one of the key drivers of policy development and implementation at every level.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000103"></a>We can see the evidence of this in the Mental Health Act Commission, where service-user involvement is not only about having an effect on the patients that it visits, but about changing the culture of the organisation. Commissioners who work alongside service users have reported that experience influences the way in which they carry out their duties. It is important that this cultural shift is preserved by the CQC&#146;s monitoring of psychiatric compulsion and that service-user and carer involvement is entrenched in every aspect of its work, too. I hope that that will be emulated across the CQC, and in support of that aim I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000104"></a><a name="80429-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08042990000408"></a>Lord Lipsey:</b> I support the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, at least as much for what it leaves out of the Bill as for what it puts into it. Under subsection (3)(a), every time a drunk who is being stitched up in A&amp;E says, &#147;This place is a shambles&#148;, that will have to be reported to the commission so that it can have regard to it. Indeed, when he says, &#147;Cor, God bless, you lot are angels&#148;, that, too, will have to be reported to the commission. </p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000105"></a>Of course I exaggerate to make the point, but it is not right to take casual remarks of members of the public as though they were equal to a more considered process. In support of the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, whether the rest of it is right or not, the phrase &#147;engage with&#148; is at the nub of the problem. We need a degree of dialogue and of mutual understanding. That is not just a question of having regard to some grand body up there saying that this or that sounds good, but of communicating in a two-way direction. That is what in the modern world the noble Baroness said this kind of consultation involves. I would like to see the Bill amended to reflect it.</p>

I can imagine sheets of guidance going to every hospital and care home in the country on what has to be reported and in what form. This is the kind of bureaucratic madness that can follow half-thought-out bits of legislation.</p>

Getting service users and carers involved in the day-to-day practice of what the commission does is so crucial. To take on board their expertise&#151;we now talk about expert patients, because they very often know more about their conditions than we do as professionals&#151;their experience and how they are treated in services is crucial to being involved on a day-to-day basis in how the commission works.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000109"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, and the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, have clearly outlined what dramatic changes we have seen in mental health services and in social services, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said, from a much more adventurous involvement than is envisaged at the moment in the Bill. We have to get something more ambitious in it, to make sure that the new commission really will be at the cutting edge and will truly involve people, because that makes a step change in the way in which services develop and respond to service users. That is what it is all about.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000110"></a>I am not sure about the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. I envisage lots of future episodes of &#147;Casualty&#148; with people filling in forms and sending them off to one commission or another; I hope not. There will never be a time when all those comments get accepted and remarked on as perhaps they should. The involvement in the work of the commission is utterly crucial, and is possibly more crucial than the first group of amendments, although they, too, are important. This will give service users what they need.</p>

My experience outside the institution of Parliament is in engineering, and I am more used to dealing with milling machines, capstan lathes, plating plants, pressings and trade exhibitions. I come almost as a virgin to this debate. I support the thrust of the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, but I want to speak to Amendment No. 104, proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, which to me is particularly significant. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000335"></a>&#147;Entry and inspection: lay inspectors</p>
</ul> (1) Persons authorised by the Commission to enter and inspect any premises shall include lay inspectors. (2) In this section "lay inspectors" means persons not trained in the profession or employed in the service being inspected&#148;.
<p><a name="08042990000306"></a>I am one of those people. I want to explain why I think that is very important.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000112"></a>Prior to placing my mother in a nursing home, I visited 19 homes, some of which, I presume, had been the subject of inspections, and which were absolutely appalling. Half of them, to put it bluntly, stank of urine when I went into them. Those were homes which, under the current inspection regime, somehow cleared the hurdle of acceptability. There was one  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>particular home, not very far from this institution of Parliament, in which I would not have kept an animal. The fees were over &#163;1,000 per week. There were more than 30 residents in the home. That is the real world that goes on outside, and when people like me, who have very little knowledge in these sorts of areas, are confronted with a decision to place someone in a home, to put it bluntly, we wonder what the hell is going wrong and how homes such as that one manage to clear the hurdle. If it is that the professionals are prepared to put up with that standard of care, it is about time that lay persons had some rights in these issues and had a right to influence events.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000113"></a>I positively endorse the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. In my view, that amendment would probably make a major contribution to dealing with the problems with which I was confronted when visiting those homes. If I were a lay inspector, and I found homes stinking of urine, as I did&#151;Monday mornings can be difficult in homes&#151;and if during the balance of a week you are confronted by the smell of urine when you go into a home, I would want action. To this day I do not understand how that is allowed to go on.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000114"></a>I toured the rooms in one home, which, presumably, had cleared its inspections under the current regime. Under the diluted arrangements that we are going to introduce, I cannot imagine how bad it will be. As I went around that home, clients were lying semi-naked on beds with the doors open, and I could see in as I passed those rooms. The rooms were dilapidated and undecorated. The beds were iron framed, which reminded me of when I was away at school in the 1950s. For that kind of conditions, there were huge fees&#151;some were far in excess of &#163;1,000 per week&#151;to which I shall turn in a later amendment. However, I should like to say that the home I have found for my mother is excellent.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000115"></a>The homes to which I am referring are finding a clientele. I wonder what families are placing their loved ones in these homes. How often are people visiting these homes? Are they simply dumping their families and oblivious to the fact that conditions are bad because they have never regularly inspected them themselves? It is not a question of the people going into these homes having rights, because very often they are beyond the capability of understanding the conditions in which they have been placed. This whole area needs a major shake-up. Based on my experience, I hope that this Bill gives us the opportunity to bring about the changes in which I very strongly believe.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000307"></a>I like the word &#147;engage&#148;. If I were to be honest, I should also like to see the word &#147;involve&#148; included, which is why I like a great deal of what Amendment No. 27 trying to do, even though my name is not attached to it.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000117"></a>Currently, there is not any explicit reference to service users, families and carers in the Bill. There should be. The essence of Amendment No. 27 is excellent. I very much like the mention of special reviews, as the noble Baroness described. She also rightly mentioned the relevance of her amendment to detained patients in particular. Where I depart from the wording of it slightly is that it is a little vague in the wording of new subsection (1)(e). It is perhaps not as clear as it might be in defining the duty that the CQC will be expected to fulfil. But, with that slight reservation, I commend it to the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000118"></a><a name="80429-gc0003.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0003.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08042990000414"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> The amendments in this group all seek to establish a more general duty for the commission to involve people in its work. We discussed the proposal for the commission to have a children and adult rights director&#151;touched on in Amendment No. 108&#151;in our last session, so I will not repeat the arguments I made on that specific element. I have already referred today to the requirements set out in Clause 2 for the commission to have regard to the views expressed by and on behalf of members of the public, including patients and service users and those who represent them, such as LINks. I would expect the commission to cover these matters in its annual reports on how it has exercised its functions under Clause 79. But this is an area I will look at again when reviewing involvement as I undertook to do in the last group of amendments.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000119"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, would therefore feel able to withdraw Amendment No. 15, which seeks to ensure that the commission will have mechanisms and channels for engaging with people who use health and adult social care services, and not move Amendment No. 108, which would require the commission to report on what it had done in this regard in its annual reports.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000120"></a>Amendment No. 27 was tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and is supported by my noble friend Lord Patel. My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, too, led a powerful debate on the proposed new clause, which sets out in more detail how service users and the public should be involved. The proposed new clause proposes specific requirements for the commission to involve lay persons in its inspections and in special reviews. It also proposes a general requirement for the commission to provide information and to consult on how it exercises its functions, or to involve it in other ways.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000121"></a>Amendment No. 104, which the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, also tabled, specifically provides that the people authorised to carry out inspections will include lay people. The Bill already allows for lay involvement in inspections, and I fully expect the commission to use lay inspectors either in inspections that are carried out for registration purposes or in other site visits associated with service reviews. In this regard, the provisions in the Bill reflect existing  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC22"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legislation, under which the Commission for Social Care Inspection has developed its Experts by Experience scheme. The Healthcare Commission also uses lay representation in its visits. Similarly, the Mental Health Act Commission, as eloquently described by my noble friend Lord Patel, includes lay people with significant direct experience of mental health services, as well as professionals such as lawyers, doctors, nurses, social workers, psychologists and other specialists, in the 100 commissioners who carry out the commission&#146;s visiting programmes. I certainly expect the Care Quality Commission to follow the excellent examples set by the current bodies in this regard.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000122"></a>However, my understanding is that the current bodies do not support routinely involving lay representatives in every visit that they undertake. I am sure noble Lords will appreciate that there might be circumstances in which it might not be appropriate to do so. Indeed, we would not want the commission to have to wait until it could secure the services of a lay inspector where it needed to carry out an urgent inspection. It is therefore right that the commission can involve lay people in inspections as it deems appropriate.</p>

It simply implies that they should be part of the group of inspectors so that they can be selected as appropriate.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000125"></a>We have also sought to ensure that the commission is required to approach its task as openly and transparently as possible. The Bill already requires the commission to consult and to provide information on how it will approach particular functions, including guidance on how it will determine compliance with registration requirements; a code of practice on how it will handle confidential information; its plans for charging fees; its plans for carrying out special reviews, other studies and research; and guidance on how it will approach using its enforcement powers.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000126"></a>In addition, the commission will be required to make available on the register information, reports of any inspections that it carries out for registration purposes, and details of what enforcement action it has taken. There is therefore already ample provision for patients, service users and carers to access information on the commission&#146;s key functions and to influence them.</p>

Why cannot we make it mandatory? Why cannot we have pools of people who are available to carry out inspections in local authority areas and who are drawn from the local community? Enough people out there have an interest in doing so. I cannot see why there should be any discretion. Surely we could create arrangements whereby it was mandatory.</p>

I have a couple of points in response. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, about the power of lay inspection. In my experience, lay inspectors are far less inhibited about saying what they think than professionals. However, I want to correct what may have been a misapprehension: lay inspectors should not merely be confined to inspection of social care services. I remind Members of the Committee that lay people have often uncovered some of the things which were going badly wrong in the health service. There is a key role for lay involvement in that, which is why I chose to use the word &#147;engage&#148; in the amendment; it is perhaps the most important word of all this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000130"></a>Why?

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000131"></a>The important point for us to remember about engagement is that users are not always right. They are not always fully informed. They are not always aware of some of the constraints under which services are, or are not, provided. They can be, and they have an important part to play in making decisions which are informed on that basis. That is why &#147;engagement&#148; is they key word. It is at its most important in mental health, where it is not unknown for service providers and practitioners to develop a sense of their own infallibility and superiority to users over years of dealing with difficult people.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000132"></a>I do not wish to delay our discussions any more, but I hope that when the Minister takes the matter away he will take those points into particular consideration. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<h5><a name="08042990000365"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000137"></a>The truth is that no one yet knows what a typical LINk will look like. None, as far as I know, is yet formed. It is of course early days, but it is too soon to tell even approximately what the likely membership profile of a LINk will be. We hope that it will be what Ministers have talked about; that is, a broadly based grouping of individuals and bodies that is able to take an active interest in the delivery of health and social care services in an area, with the necessary energy and commitment to translate that interest into a positive contribution to service quality and service planning.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000138"></a>There are two things in particular that make LINks an ideal point of reference for the commission. First, like the commission, LINks will have the ability to enter and view both health and social care facilities, and to talk to patients and service users. That is, in part, an answer to the point raised, very tellingly, by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. The second advantage is that of all the bodies collating the views of patients and the public, LINks is likely to be the most broadly based and, hence, the most representative. The potential for useful feedback from LINks to the commission is enormous.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000139"></a>Members of Committee may recall that when the local government Bill was debated a degree of concern was expressed at the idea of LINks needing to get permission from the appropriate regulator before entering and viewing premises. That fetter on the freedom of LINks was not a popular idea and, I am glad to say, was thought better of. But the idea that no one disputed, because it was eminently sensible, was that the health and social care regulators should work closely with LINks, where possible co-ordinating its respective visits, and that the regulators should stand ready to receive from LINks any information which could be relevant to the exercise of its regulatory functions. Particularly when it comes to healthcare facilities, but not exclusively, the work of LINks and the work of the regulator could be seen as, in some respects, complementary.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000140"></a>It is with that thought in mind that I have tabled Amendment No. 64, which proposes that where the commission issues any sort of a notice to a registered service provider or manager&#151;whether it is a notice granting registration, a warning notice of some sort, or a notice to suspend or vary someone&#146;s registration&#151;it should inform the relevant LINk that it is doing so. In making this suggestion, and in the context of my other amendments, I particularly draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the submission made by the CSCI to the Public Bill Committee in another place where it said in paragraph 43:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000337"></a>&#147;It would be useful if there were an explicit expectation that the new care Commission had a relationship with Local Involvement Networks&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000141"></a>Perhaps I could cover just one aspect of this idea. There are some who look at the proposals for the CQC and who regret that the new body, unlike the Healthcare  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC25"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Commission, will not have a role in handling complaints. A group of amendments later covers this concern. I have to say that it is probably right to try to do what the Government propose and to make complaints handling, as far as possible, a more locally based process, which is undertaken by the organisation involved, and to have the ombudsman in the background as the second tier back-up.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000142"></a>However, there is no doubt that if we look at the Healthcare Commission&#146;s current role in handling complaints, it gives it a perspective on the quality of healthcare and health services, which is of value and which it would not otherwise have. In particular, it enables it to discern trends with patterns in the matters complained about, which can prove to be informative and useful. If a mechanism could be found for feeding the views and experiences of LINks into the work of the CQC&#151;a service user panel could well be that mechanism&#151;we could hold out the prospect of replicating the wider benefit that currently flows from complaints-handling; namely, the ability to discern patterns or trends in the concerns expressed by service users.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000143"></a>I hope that the Minister will look constructively on these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000144"></a><a name="80429-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08042990000421"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I support the noble Earl. I start from the premise that the Minister is not responsible for the past history of patient and public involvement. As far as he is concerned, the verdict is &#147;not guilty&#148;. It is, however, worth remembering some of the history. It has been quite a sad story. Volunteers who have given so much in the interests of sick and vulnerable people have been pushed around, disbanded, reformed and disempowered.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000145"></a>I return briefly to community health councils, which were so ably led by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey. They were disbanded because they were too effective. They had real power to refer decisions taken by local health authorities to the Secretary of State. They inspected and reported, carrying out some thorough investigations into how hospitals provided their services. When I chaired the Brighton and Hove Health Authority, we made it our business to work with the local CHC because we recognised that it was a powerful organisation. It was not afraid to make public all our shortcomings. We respected it, and we even commissioned it to undertake surveys and inspections, including of hospital food. As a result, I remember being mortified to read the awful headline in the <I>Evening Argos</I>, &#147;Slug found in hospital lettuce&#148;.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000146"></a>We were taken by surprise when the CHCs were abolished under Alan Milburn&#146;s 2000 NHS plan. There had not been much discussion and there had been little thought about how to fill the void. We then had forums, which had less power. Again, volunteers were pushed around and given a new brief. They related directly to individual trusts, but they proved to be uncomfortable and had to go, as did their overarching body, the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000147"></a>Now we are left with LINks, which are to improve health and social care by promoting and supporting commissioning and scrutinising services. Unlike their  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>predecessor forums, they are not connected with a specific service that an individual hospital provides, but they are coterminous with local authorities. There is real merit in this. It is good that LINks relate to both health and social services. If they concentrate on the patient experience&#151;the patient journey, the individual&#151;they can be hugely effective if they are given some power. However, their powers are minimal. They can make reports and recommendations and receive a reply within a set time, but there is no requirement for the body concerned to take any action as a result. They can ask for information and receive a reply&#151;big deal. They can tell an overview and scrutiny committee what they have found, and they can get a response, but again no action is required as a result. There is a danger that unless we build them into this new regulation, they will simply be a talking shop.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000148"></a>In the <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our Say</I> White Paper, we were told that people should have more choice and a louder voice. In my local area, not only is there diminishing choice, but patients and the public have lost their voice. The forums were closed on 31 March and the host&#151;the overarching organisation that is the home to the LINks&#151;will not be appointed until July. Once the host is chosen, it will have to recruit members, who will have to decide what structure they want. They will also have to be CRB-checked, and will be lucky to have any patient or public voice by the autumn at the very earliest. Most likely, they will have it by Christmas.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000149"></a>In the mean time, local people are fighting to retain maternity services and a major reconfiguration is taking place across two counties in the Brighton and Hove City Council area with no formal system for patient and public involvement. So it is not really surprising that we have marches and protests in our towns and villages and that the local population is losing faith in the NHS. It is widely recognised throughout health and social care that user involvement is a mark of best practice. Indeed, the Healthcare Commission actively monitors the requirement of providers to engage with their users. In many parts of the country, the return will be a blank sheet because patient and public involvement no longer exists. Those of us in the commercial world know that if we do not actively seek the views of our customers or clients, we lose them and we are in danger of calling in the receiver. How much more important is it to have the views of the discerning public when receiving a service delivered by a near monopoly?</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000150"></a>Amendments Nos. 16, 26 and 64 and those of other noble Lords seek to make it crystal clear that LINks are an integral part of the commission's work. A regulator who is not engaged with patients and the public will have a reduced understanding of the impact the work is having. It will miss the eyes and the ears of perceptive lay people, people who can sense immediately when something is wrong. When those of us who, in the course of our careers or through family responsibilities, as illustrated by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, visit residential homes and geriatric wards, it is the smell of a place, as he said, which is the immediate indicator of quality.

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000151"></a>Angela Coulter, chief executive of the Picker Institute, in an interview in the Royal College of General Practitioners&#146; March edition of the college&#146;s news, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000338"></a>&#147;There is evidence that successful patient engagement brings a number of benefits, such as reducing the costs and allowing resources to be used more efficiently. It also promotes self-management, so that when a patient seeks medical intervention, that intervention is appropriate and effective. In the long run, encouraging patients to play an active role in their healthcare saves time and money&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000152"></a>So we know that user involvement is effective and, in the context of what we are debating this afternoon, we also know that it can lead to better regulation. I am hopeful that the LINk system is effective&#151;after all, statutorily it is all we have. I am delighted to hear the Minister say that he will look at this, so through amendments we should ensure that it is involved with the regulatory process.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000153"></a>I was very encouraged to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, in a previous debate talk about engagement. However, I agree with my noble friend Lord Howe: I like the word &#147;involvement&#148;. I believe Nelson Mandela said that if you tell people, they will forget; if you show people, they will not remember; if you involve people, they will understand. We are seeking the opportunity to deepen the understanding of the new regulator by involving LINks. I know that the Minister has a tremendous track record in involving people in the Next Stage review and I am delighted that he will think about the points that have been made this afternoon and that he will return with an amendment on Report. For me, that is no surprise.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000154"></a><a name="80429-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08042990000422"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> I support the amendments tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, and I want to speak to Amendments Nos. 17 and 21A that I have tabled. Like the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, my objective in moving these amendments is to help to save the Government&#146;s reputation. I am sure that that is an objective shared, maybe in one small element, by our two colleagues who have spoken. The history referred to by the noble Baroness of, first, the abolition of the community health councils and then the abolition of public and patient involvement forums is not a happy one. It is for that reason that great thought needs to be given to how LINks are to develop and how they are to be involved in the quality process in which the Bill is so important.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000155"></a>We start from considerable concerns about how LINks will operate. We cannot tell because it is still too early, although the patients&#146; forums have already disappeared, but we know that they will not provide a consistent pattern of involvement and scrutiny across the country because they will not be related to each other in the way they are established. Each local authority area will find a host body. There is no  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>guarantee that those host bodies will be the same or will be connected to organise the LINks, and there will be no clarity about what the expectations are intended to be for those LINks. There has deliberately, and perhaps rightly, been vagueness about who are to be the members of LINks. There has similarly been a feeling that it is right and proper that in every part of the country LINks should determine how they should operate in the interests of best reflecting the needs of a particular locality. The consequence is that there will be even more of a patchwork quilt of local involvement than there was under community health councils or public and patient involvement forums because there will be no mechanism whereby they can be drawn together.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000156"></a>The noble Baroness has been kind enough to refer to my period as director of the Association of Community Health Councils, and I have obviously taken an interest in all this. One of the distinctive features of community health councils, through the national association of which I was director for a period, and the public and patient involvement forums was the existence of a national body that was able to assist them and support them in the work that they were doing, certainly as far as CHCs were concerned, was involved in raising standards in the work that they did and was also able to draw out general lessons about the issues being identified around the country. If the LINk process is to work, there needs to be statutory recognition of the role that it is to play.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000157"></a>Following Second Reading, my noble friend Lord Darzi was kind enough to write to pick up points about LINks. He wrote, quite correctly, that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000339"></a>&#147;Clause 2 of the Bill requires the new Commission to consider the views of the public, as well as patient and service user representative groups, in all aspects of its work&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000308"></a>He also wrote that the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="08042990000352"></a>&#147;have deliberately framed the duty in relation to representative bodies generally rather than LINks specifically, because we think it is right that the Commission should have the ability to engage with the full range of people that will have an interest in its work&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000309"></a>That would be a fine argument to deploy if it was being suggested that the sole mechanism for listening to local views or to the views of users of services or their families was to be the LINks, but that is not what is being proposed by any of these amendments. They are simply suggesting that the bodies that have been given a statutory role by Parliament should have a statutory role in respect of this commission. That is not to say that the views that will be expressed by other representative groups or local groups will have no value; it is simply saying that that statutory role and the fact that they are resourced by public money, because they will be through local authorities, should give them a particular right to be listened to. If LINks are not explicitly referred to, it is likely that people will pick and choose which voice they wish to listen to. That will always be the case, but if there is no expectation that they will listen to the voice that has a statutory basis and is supported by public money, we are in danger of wasting that public money and the statutory status that has been conferred on LINks. That is why it is very important that LINks are  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>referred to explicitly in the proposals for the Care Quality Commission, which is the purpose of Amendment No. 17.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000158"></a>Amendment No. 21A is in two parts. First, it aims to place a responsibility on the Care Quality Commission to ensure that on an annual basis the lessons drawn out from the work of LINks around the country are pulled together and considered. That is important because the issues highlighted in different places in different ways by different LINks may demonstrate a pattern, which should inform the plans and intentions of the CQC in its future work. At the moment, there is no mechanism whereby that will happen. There is no national structure for LINks, which relate to individual local authorities and to the service providers in their patch. There is no way in which those lessons will be drawn out. It is extremely important that those matters are dealt with.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000159"></a>For example, in this Committee, we will at various times consider amendments about the quality of food in hospitals, which I know is a concern of many organisations. When I was director of the Association of Community Health Councils, something like 12 to 14 years ago we published a report, <I>Hungry in </I><I>Hospital</I><I>?</I>, which highlighted, from the experience of individual community health councils around the country, the problems that particularly the elderly and many other vulnerable patients were having in the way in which food was served to them.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000160"></a>Those messages were pulled together from individual reports and organisations, for which there will be no mechanism at the moment. That is why something which will place an obligation on someone&#151;I would suggest that the Care Quality Commission is the best place to do that&#151;to pull those lessons out will be extremely important. If it is to be the Care Quality Commission, the expectation would be that that would help to inform its planning.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000161"></a>The second element of Amendment No. 21A is to consider the effectiveness in each local authority area of the arrangements under that section. I assume that my noble friend Lord Darzi will have absolutely no problem with that amendment, because when my noble friend wrote to me he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000340"></a>&#147;LINks will ... be required to report annually to the Secretary of State&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000310"></a>He goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000341"></a>&#147;The Care Quality Commission will play a vital role in supporting LINks&#146; development&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000311"></a>I am not clear how that will happen, but he is saying that that will be the case&#151;</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000342"></a>&#147;The Commission will assess local authority social services using outcome focused indicators and this will contribute to the CAA. These assessments will include consideration of how engaged the public and service users are in service planning and the impact of public involvement and user feedback on local services&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000312"></a>He is saying that, by the nature of the local area agreements and the monitoring role that the Care Quality Commission will have, one of the requirements will be to look at the effectiveness of local engagement.</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80429-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000162"></a>This is a job that the Care Quality Commission will be doing anyway. Therefore, to make it explicit to report on the effectiveness of the local area agreements seems to be something to which there can be no possible objection from my noble friend. It is a job that the CQC will do anyway. For the sake of transparency and clarity, and the importance that public money is used effectively to engage local citizens, local users of service and their families, it seems very sensible that this obligation should be placed on the Care Quality Commission.</p>

I have added my name in support of this group of amendments, which all set out the relationship between the CQC and local involvement networks.

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000164"></a>This is about taking a joined-up approach. We should expect LINks to feed in their knowledge and experiences to CQC, so that it can act on the basis of the widest range of user views. We should expect some independent oversight of how well user involvement is working on the ground under the new arrangements so that problems can be picked up quickly and improvements made. At the moment, as has been clearly outlined, the relationship is undefined. I believe that we will do users of health and social care no favours by leaving it in this way.</p>

I was once upon a time on a community health council, when I was a young mother with little children, and I worked extraordinarily hard. It is never too late even in this debate to pay tribute to those people who worked on the community health councils; they worked hard and made a tremendous contribution to the health service. As a health service manager later on, I remember being driven mad by our local community health council, which was a very good thing indeed. It would not get off our backs if it was dissatisfied with something that was going on in the area. I was very sad to see the demise of the community health councils, although I was not in any sort of health brief at the time. Likewise the patient forums, which had barely got going; they were only just grouped and knew what they were doing.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000166"></a>We have heard today that there are no LINks ye, because no host bodies have been found&#151;that makes LINks sound a bit like tapeworms or liver flukes. What a dreadful phrase! Contrast that with what we were discussing earlier; the advertisement for and appointment of a shadow director of the Care Quality Commission, which rather pushes the users of the health service down the ladder a little bit and says that they are not nearly as important as some of us think they are. We should support the amendments, and I hope that the Government will take them on board and look at this carefully. It is an ideal and logical way

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000168"></a>This group of amendments seeks to ensure that LINks are in the Bill. Amendment No. 17 requires the Care Quality Commission to have regard to comments or views expressed by local involvement networks that it considers are relevant. Amendment No. 16 is very similar and singles out LINks as a particular body whose views the commission must take account of when performing its functions. Amendment No. 26 simply defines a local involvement network for the purposes of Amendment No. 16.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000169"></a>I agree wholeheartedly that the involvement of those who use care services, carers and the general public must be central to the work of the new commission. Clause 2 already includes a requirement to have regard to the views expressed by and on behalf of members of the public in relation to activities where the commission has functions. My noble friend the Minister has already given commitments to address the issue of patient care, carer and user involvement as we move forward with the Bill. As discussed on Report in the Commons&#151;someone mentioned this earlier&#151;Clause 2 was specifically amended to refer to &#147;on behalf of&#148;, to ensure that the commission listens to representative groups, which include, but are not limited to, LINks.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000170"></a>Amendment No. 21A places a duty on the new commission to summarise the comments and views expressed by LINks and to report on the quality of LINks arrangements in each locality. Under Clause 79, the commission is already required to make an annual report, which must cover the way in which the commission has exercised its functions during the year. I reassure my noble friends Lady Wilkins and Lord Harris that it will include reporting on how it has engaged with the public. It seems highly likely that, as part of its engagement work over the year, the commission will have worked with LINks as a very important stakeholder, and that will duly be captured. As previous debates have indicated, we are committed to ensuring that the Bill reflects more strongly the aspirations for the involvement of patients, service users, families and carers.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000171"></a>As to whether the commission should have a role in monitoring the effectiveness of LINks, I put it to the Committee that that is an appropriate function for the commission. I say that because LINks have their own accountability. They are required to be transparent and must make public certain decisions that they make. They report annually direct to the Secretary of State and must provide details concerning their activities as set out in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 as well as the extent to which local views were taken on board by commissioners and providers. LINks must also report

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000172"></a>The commission&#146;s functions are assuring the safety and quality of services, safeguarding the rights of patients subject to the Mental Health Act, commissioner assurance, the performance assessment of providers and minimising the burden of regulation. The proposal that the commission should consider the effectiveness of LINks therefore does not seem to fit with that remit. Indeed, placing the role with the commission would appear to cut across the arrangements to review their effectiveness.</p>

Where the Care Quality Commission initiates enforcement action against a provider, it seems appropriate for the commission to advise commissioners so that they can make arrangements, if necessary, to commission alternative care. It is therefore not necessary for there to be express provision for early notification to LINks for two reasons. First, under Clause 85, there is already provision allowing for regulations to make provision for the publication of enforcement action. That is an important provision which will provide the public with information about successful action the commission has taken in relation to breaches of registration. The purpose of Clause 35 is to allow early notification where a particular body may need to take action as a result of the initiation of enforcement action. I do not believe that in the majority of circumstances where the commission initiates enforcement action against a provider there is a need for LINks to take any specific action, although in the commission of their duties it seems likely that they will be aware of, interested and indeed involved in any given situation.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000178"></a>Secondly, Clause 35 allows the commission to notify any other person whom it already considers to be appropriate, so if it considers it appropriate for LINks to be notified, there is a provision that allows it to do so. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. Given the assurance that the Bill already allows LINks as well as other representative bodies to be involved in the work of the commission, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

However, the amendment suggests that there is statutory recognition of that voice&#151;that channel&#151;along with all the other channels that merit being specifically referred to in the Bill because the bodies that are being set up by Parliament for this purpose will receive public money for this purpose. For that reason, they should be separately and explicitly mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000185"></a>In case the Minister is not minded to reply to that point, I shall also comment on her saying why it was not appropriate for the Care Quality Commission to report on the effectiveness of LINk arrangements. She said in effect that she acknowledged the distinction that I was drawing between accountability to a body that has a vested interest in running things and making them effective and that external scrutiny would be by the Department of Health. Yet we are told&#151;she made this clear in her response&#151;that the Care Quality Commission will have a responsibility to look at how engaged the public and service users in each area are in service planning and in the impact on public involvement and user feedback on local services. We are told that the Care Quality Commission will do that, so are we now being told that the effectiveness of those arrangements will be scrutinised by the Care Quality Commission and entirely separately by some army of civil servants in the Department of Health? The implication of what she is saying is that this will be duplicated. The Care Quality Commission will do work on how effective these arrangements are in local areas, but it must not publish it because that would not quite fit in with everything else that it does. It will do it and keep it secret. Separately, the Department of Health will monitor the commission&#146;s effectiveness and presumably tell someone whether it thinks it is effective.</p>

I would like to have supported the noble Earl, Lord Howe, because he and I have battled this out and tried to get some sense into LINks during the passage of the original Bill. I am speaking now because there is time for thought between now and Report, when I may be more vocal in this area. I do not know what LINks are or will be&#151;I do not even know what grammar to use to describe them. That has been my difficulty. Therefore, if I support the noble Earl, which I would like to do, I do not know whom I am supporting in having this power in relation to the users. I might prefer all the other groupings, if I understood them. I might have preferred Parliament to have created a different kind of representative body.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000188"></a>One reason for the demise of the community health councils was that they were rather troublesome. They raised issues that should have been raised, but sometimes not in the quietest way. My worry about LINks is that they are so amorphous that their voice will be muted, particularly in relating directly to the local authority. Some organisations owe their funding to the local authority. I declare an interest as someone with a sister who feels she cannot speak out about what is happening in the voluntary sector because she is dependent on funding from her local authority, which is a typical scenario that happens with people who are dependent on funding. LINks will be dependent on funding from the local authority. At the moment, we have no picture of how that will be managed or monitored&#151;points made clearly in previous debates. I also find it difficult to know whether it is appropriate to monitor user involvement.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000189"></a>While I am on my feet, I should say that there are also some real issues about user involvement and the privacy of those using the institutions, homes and hospitals. I was appalled to hear the noble Lord&#146;s description. I hope and pray that he reported directly to his local commissioners, because no visitor should see that kind of condition and not report what has been seen. He should also expect a response. I relate that directly back to LINks. LINks should have on them people such as the noble Lord who can report directly back. Then there is a voice that is not muted by the local authority. The report can go directly to the Secretary of State, although I still do not know exactly how that accountability will work, and the commission will somehow be able to get that information together. The Commission for Social Care Inspection excelled in many areas, but particularly where there was no information about the number of homes and their conditions. We now have a complete register. It would be valuable if the new commission could link into the local bodies to gather that information.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000190"></a>There is an awful lot to do here until we are absolutely clear about how this pattern and matrix will work. That is crucial if ordinary folks&#146; voices are to be heard appropriately and privacy maintained.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000192"></a>I fully take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth. We do not know what LINks will look like&#151;I made that point earlier&#151;but they are creatures of the Government's own making. It is odd, to say the least, that the Minister will not countenance the idea of giving them a special place at the table because, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris, rightly said, LINks are established by Parliament and funded by public money. Because of that alone, they have a particular claim to be involved and listened to, not exclusively, as the noble Lord emphasised, but certainly automatically.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000202"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights has proposed the amendment as a result of the findings of its report into older people in healthcare. The people whom the committee was concerned about were vulnerable and powerless. In that inquiry, we heard a lot of evidence that strongly echoes the remarks made earlier this afternoon by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, when he described his search for a care home.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000203"></a>Being able to complain without fear of victimisation is an essential element of the protection of rights of all vulnerable people, whether they are prisoners, detained mental patients, people in hospital or people receiving social care. It is not just about being able to complain; it is also important to get a satisfactory and speedy response. The amendment would require the Care Quality Commission, in exercising its functions, to consider the extent to which the complaints of those who use the services are dealt with adequately by the providers of health and social care who are being regulated.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000204"></a>Amendment No. 63, our second on complaints, would require the Secretary of State to enable the Care Quality Commission to hear individual complaints where the service users were not satisfied that their direct provider had handled a complaint effectively.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000205"></a>As I indicated, the amendments in this group are intended to deal with problems that we identified in our study into older people in healthcare. These were that the system was inaccessible; did not meet all the complaints that residents may wish to raise, particularly where human rights were at issue; and could not deal with complaints raised by self-funders, who could complain only directly to their provider&#151;which was difficult when they were resident in a care home&#151;or through a contractual claim in the civil courts. The Government responded to our report, making it clear that, in their view, these amendments were not necessary because, in cases where care is commissioned by the NHS or local authorities, there will be a statutory complaints process with a further avenue of complaint to the relevant ombudsman, who is either the health ombudsman or the Local Government Ombudsman. Those whose care is privately funded will not be covered by these procedures, but the Government are considering what options should be available to them.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000206"></a>I hope that the Minister can tell us what the options will be for those whose care is privately funded, and whether the Government have had any rethinking on this question as a result of the Joint Committee&#146;s reports and amendments. I beg to move. </p>

<p><a name="08042990000208"></a>Amendment No. 50 says that regulations may make provision not only about the handling of complaints  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC38"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but about the implementation of recommendations arising from complaints. Amendment No. 48 has a more limited scope, but would enable the CQC to issue a warning notice if an organisation failed to implement recommendations arising from complaints upheld by the Health Service Ombudsman. Amendment No. 58A of the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, extends this provision further to include the Local Government Ombudsman. Together, all these amendments ensure that the Care Quality Commission has a power to deal effectively with an organisation that fails to deal with complaints properly and to implement fully recommendations arising from those complaints. The implementation of recommendations is the absolutely crucial point, and where so many trusts fail.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000209"></a>I am embarrassed to confess to the Committee that complaints are the one area of work on which the East London NHS Foundation Trust, which I chair, failed to meet the standard of the Healthcare Commission last year. It is perhaps ironic for me to stand here and propose that the regulatory authorities should have greater powers to ensure that people like me do a little better in future, but I have no hesitation in doing so. I shall say a word or two about our experience because it illustrates the value of the Healthcare Commission&#146;s system. I will then go on to indicate why it is nevertheless inadequate. We were not able to meet the standard because of the long-term sickness of a member of staff that year. This public embarrassment in a single year has led to a complete change and the reorganisation of my department to make absolutely sure that we have proper back-up so that our complaints are dealt with properly and on time in future. Although we had done well in the past, we were running a system that was at risk and that exposed us to failure in the event of long-term sickness. We were lucky, until last year, and we are not the only culprits.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000210"></a>The Healthcare Commission&#146;s report on complaints, which was issued on 7 April 2008, concluded that trusts have some way to go before they effectively resolve the complaints they receive and learn from the issues patients raise. Why is that so if the Healthcare Commission&#146;s system is adequate? It is clearly not adequate. I accept that only by giving complaints a higher profile and putting more pressure on requiring the trust to do the job well will we ensure that sufficient priority is given to this vital customer care area of work. The reality at the moment is that some trusts&#146; recommendations simply get lost in the system&#151;I have to tell the Committee that I am familiar with that&#151;and they are not fully implemented. The same problems arise again and again. Clearly, that is entirely unacceptable.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000211"></a>Why is this so terribly important? Complaints systems are the safety valve for the public when things go wrong. If the safety valve goes wrong, public confidence in the whole system is threatened. I am acutely aware of that because of my work heading the police complaints system for a while. I often faced the fury of families and communities when the complaints system, for which I was responsible, failed, we had long delays in our investigations or we came out with results that were not satisfactory to the family or the community. Facing that fury was one of  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC39"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC39</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the most challenging areas of work with which I have ever had to deal. The anger that people feel if the system has gone wrong and the complaints system fails on top of that is incredible.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000212"></a>In the health service, these things are rather hidden. The fury is hidden because people cannot express it anywhere. Yet it is there and it is dangerous. I shall give an example of how terrible this can be. This example comes from Rethink. A young man suffering from a serious mental illness was given Clozapine. As my noble friend Lady Murphy will be well aware, people using medication such as Clozapine must have regular blood tests because they are susceptible to diabetes. In this case, blood tests were not offered until the mother of the man intervened and made multiple requests to the trust to test her son. By the time the tests were done, the son had diabetes. I find that absolutely shocking and terrible, and I am sure that other noble Lords do too. When the Healthcare Commission investigated, it found that the Clozapine clinic had simply not been running. A year later, when the mother raised with the trust what had happened as a result of the Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation, the staff had no recollection of the complaint or of the recommendations. Nothing had happened. The Healthcare Commission&#146;s system is not ensuring that complaints are properly dealt with and that recommendations are implemented. I put it to the Minister that that has to improve. I think I have said enough about that to make the point.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000213"></a>I raise two related issues. Help the Aged has expressed a fear that the proposed loss of the investigative powers of the Healthcare Commission will leave a gap. I would be grateful if the Minister could give us an assurance that that gap will be filled. It is very important.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000214"></a>Amendment No. 53B, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, is supported by Help the Aged and argues that existing complaints procedures are inadequate, particularly for people who fund their own care. My noble friend Lady Stern has already raised that point. Such people have no access to an independent complaints system beyond that available from the provider. Those funded by the local authority, as my noble friend said, have access to the local authority complaints system. Older people are very fearful of complaining to their provider for obvious reasons&#151;there can be very unpleasant retribution.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000215"></a>The Minister in the other place stated that the Government are considering options for self-funders, but he also suggested that self-funders could take their custom elsewhere. I find it shocking that anyone could suggest that a 90 year-old woman could up sticks and take her custom elsewhere. Perhaps the Minister might raise this matter with his colleague in the other place. It is utterly cynical and completely unacceptable. I find it hard to think of any reason not to adopt these amendments. I hope the Minister will agree. I beg to move.</p>

I am anxious that the Government should bring forward provisions to address that in relation to privately funded, but also publicly funded, complainants in care homes.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000217"></a>I have recently experienced a very elderly relative being evicted from a care home as a result of becoming too dependent and frail. She was shipped off to hospital with a fractured femur, which is very common. I have experienced that professionally a million times, as have many other doctors, I am sure. She was evicted with no notice at all and we were told, &#147;She is now in hospital, so it is up to you to find somewhere else because she is just too bad for us to take back, even if she recovers&#148;. At the end of the rehabilitation process for the fractured femur, we as a family are faced with trekking around trying to find an alternative placement.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000218"></a>That kind of eviction happens often. Since I have made this case known, many people have written to me about similar instances. There is nowhere to complain to. Of course, I have complained to the group of homes where this occurred, but there is absolutely no come-back at all; no right to retain your home; no right to have an appropriate assessment of services; no right to have things talked through at all; and nowhere to complain about the manner in which such things are done.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000219"></a>I turn to the amendment of my noble friend Lady Meacher on the need for a power to follow up the recommendations that result from investigations of complaints. My noble friends Lord Patel and Lady Meacher will be endlessly aware of complaints that have been investigated by the Mental Health Act Commission, when one has had to go back time and time again to the same place to say, &#147;What have you done about it?&#148;, and nothing happens. You almost have to sit on the doorstep of the medical director, the senior nurse or the chief executive and say, &#147;I am not leaving your office until you have given me a plan of what you are going to do about this problem&#148;. I applaud the fact that yet again there is an emphasis on local resolution, but the NHS has been spectacularly bad at dealing with matters locally and is perhaps even worse than local authorities, although I am not so sure about their complaints procedures. The responses to complaints&#151;when as chairman of the strategic health authority you sign the letters that finally reach you because they are so dreadful&#151;embarrass you, because the responses are transparently ghastly. You can only send them back so often for a rewrite before you agree to sign them.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000220"></a>We must give someone powers&#151;I cannot see who else it could be except the Care Quality Commission&#151;to be able to go in and ask, &#147;Have you achieved this, this and this, which were recommended as a result of this complaint?&#148;, to ensure that trusts and other health service and social service bodies are faced with the threat that at least Big Brother will breath down their neck if they do not do it. The Care Quality Commission is Big Brother in this respect.</p>

I think back to my time in this area when most people who complained were not seeking personal redress; they wanted to see the system improved. Yes, it would be nice to get a proper apology, but they were really looking for some undertaking or some feeling that the lessons had been learnt from something that had gone wrong in their particular case.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000222"></a>When you return to an issue after a number of years, it is always interesting to see whether things have developed. I was talking to a business contact whom I had not seen for a while. He said, &#147;I have had this terrible problem. Have you heard about my teeth?&#148;. It turned out that he had been given the wrong medication and goodness only knows what in hospital. What was now driving him was not that this appalling mistake had happened and that he had been incapacitated for a period, but the quality of the response that he had had. It was, like all those apologies that I remember from when I was involved in community health councils, classically of the nature, &#147;We are so sorry that you have found it necessary to complain&#148;. That was it; there was no indication of what was going to be done about the particular complaint.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000223"></a>When he pressed for a further response, it was that the person involved was no longer with the trust. That might indicate that action has been taken, but it might indicate that the person was an agency worker who was no longer providing agency services in that trust. He was looking for some statement that said that a procedure had been implemented that would prevent that error in prescribing from arising again. Whether or not that was a sensible thing to do, he would have liked that issue to be addressed.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000224"></a>What concerns me, and the reason why I support the amendments, is that it is necessary to build in a requirement to learn lessons and to implement them where recommendations have been made following some major shortcoming. This group of amendments is about that. I come back to the point, which has already been made, that if this is not monitored or seen as part of the remit of the Care Quality Commission, whose responsibility is it and whose responsibility will it be to ensure that these matters are picked up and dealt with? My concern is that it will not happen in the absence of that responsibility. If the assumption is that it will be dealt with by someone else, no doubt by the Department of Health or whomever else it might be, why is that not a relevant factor for the Care Quality Commission in looking at the way in which these issues are dealt with by the bodies that it regulates? That is an essential part of assessing whether the management is good and learns from the things that go wrong.</p>

<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I am sure that noble Lords will understand why I am saying that. My comments are based on conversations that I have had with others.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000226"></a>I shall concentrate my remarks on the reference made by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, to self-funders.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000227"></a>The financial bottom line in London is that you will get nothing for under &#163;1,000 a week, which is &#163;50,000 a year. If you want something reasonable, it will cost you &#163;1,200 a week, which is &#163;60,000 a year, or &#163;100,000 a year of taxable income to fund it. We are talking about a very expensive service, and people who pay that kind of money for their care&#151;that includes my mother, to whom I refer only because there are others like her in other institutions&#151;demand certain standards. At the moment, self-funders are in an impossible position in nursing homes. They can say and do nothing, and have to put up with it, unless they or a relative are prepared to place themselves on the line and take a risk that there will be no retribution inside the home. As I say, this has nothing to do with my mother&#146;s situation. I must keep emphasising that because I do not want my comments to be misrepresented in any way.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000228"></a>I thought long and hard about the solution. I shall quote selectively from the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, because the following words are the nub of the amendment so far as I am concerned. They are:</p>
<ul><a name="08042990000355"></a>&#147;the extent to which complaints ... are adequately dealt with by the bodies which it regulates&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000315"></a>Those are the key words. There is a way of dealing with this. As I say, I am an engineer and a trader by background and not a professional in this area, so I look at this more as part of the client group. Many of the complaints are not hugely important to us, but they are to the people who are in these institutions. They can be very small. They can be about the variety of the diet; the arrangements for cleaning people; the people, such as the nurses, who have been allocated to them; at what time they are required to get out of bed in the morning and be put to bed in the evening; at what time the television is turned off; and whether they are allowed to circulate within the home. There are all kinds of minor things that cannot necessarily be dealt with in a conversation with the home manager, because the information can somehow feed its way down the line and the client&#151;that is to say, the resident&#151;may well feel that they will somehow suffer as a result.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000229"></a>There is a need for someone between the client, the home management and the nursing staff who is utterly independent and can be relied on to receive information and deal with complaints effectively by raising them directly with the home management without identifying the person who has made the complaint or the relatives who represent that person. I do not know what the position is in homes that are in essence funded by local authorities and where the entire intake might well consist of people who are funded publicly; I am talking about self-funders. We can find these people, and one function of the commission should be to establish a structure that can identify people in communities who are in a position  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC43"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to act in this independent role. They do not deal with major complaints; they deal with the minor things that people as residents find impossible to raise in the home. Many such issues arise.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000230"></a>I talked to a resident of a home in the north of England that is very near my former constituency. That person had a catalogue of complaints that were not hugely important, but it was quite clear that they were causing them immense frustration and concern. Even I felt it difficult to raise the issue with the management in the home for fear that they might communicate what I had said to the nursing staff. It might be fed back to a member of the nursing staff and to a particular resident to whom I had been seen talking. So you are in an utterly impossible position.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000231"></a>Therefore, all I am asking for is a structure which allows for an independent person. Perhaps it could be linked to the LINks, to which my noble friend referred when speaking to his amendment. I do not know whether that is the answer, but I simply would ask that it is considered. At present, the position is utterly impossible for people who are paying out annually a very large amount of money.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000232"></a><a name="80429-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08042990000445"></a>Baroness Greengross:</b> I support these amendments and should like to make two points. On self-funders, the Minister with responsibility for care in another place has said publicly on many occasions that this is the total unintended consequence. It was never intended that self-funders should be treated in this way and not be given the help and advice that they need. I very much hope that the Government will do something about that very soon&#151;certainly, in the Green Paper which will shortly be brought forward. At the moment, it is an absolute disaster for self-funders. We all know that it is very difficult to have a home worth &#163;21,000 or less in this country. Therefore, to be a self-funder you do not have to be particularly wealthy.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000233"></a>As regards complaints and human rights, one of the obvious places to go is the Equality and Human Rights Commission, on which I am a commissioner. But there are severe limitations to what the commission can do on human rights. It is absolutely essential that the Care Quality Commission takes up these cases of complaint. The EHRC can comment, hold inquiries and be an advocate on issues such as dealing with policies, but individual cases cannot be taken up in same way as equality cases. Therefore, the CQC must take on this role very thoroughly, with gusto, and really sort out these problems. As the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has said, some of these issues may be minor but, in many cases, they are major issues, which affect people&#146;s lives and, sometimes, cost them their lives.</p>

<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC44"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they want to introduce an independent element into complaints procedures for people who fund their own care. I would welcome further details of what that will mean. Can the Minister clarify whether the 40,000 people or their families who partly self-fund through top-up payments are included in the definition of self-funders? That is important.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000236"></a>Secondly, when the current investigatory powers are removed from the Healthcare Commission, does the Minister believe that the Health Service Ombudsman will be able to pick up the anticipated volume of complaints? If so, what is the basis of this understanding?</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000237"></a>Finally, the CQC will be a joint health and social care regulatory body. Complaints in the two systems are handled very differently. I cannot be the only Member of this Committee who has had reason to make a complaint within the NHS on behalf of someone who was not a relative but with whom I was concerned, only to have patient confidentiality thrown straight back at me as a reason for not doing anything at all. I would have thought that one of the big things that the Care Quality Commission would have to do early on would be to establish the underlying principles by which one regulates two currently completely different complaints systems. It is not unusual for those who are most active in raising complaints in social care not to be recipients of the services, but they know what goes on and they have a heavy interest in them. I would welcome the Minister addressing those matters in his response.</p>

I welcome the opportunity to reinforce that.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000239"></a>Amendment No. 18, tabled on behalf of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, would require the commission to have regard to the level of satisfaction with complaints handling. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and my noble friend Lady Jones have taken a different approach. Amendments Nos. 50 and 53B build on existing provisions in Clause 16 to make it explicit that registration requirements could cover the steps which registered providers should take to act on any recommendations resulting from complaints. Amendment No. 53B also addresses a different point, specifying that registration requirements could, in particular, cover the handling of complaints made by those service users who do not currently have recourse to a second-stage complaints process. Finally, Amendments Nos. 58 and 58A would enable the commission to issue warning notices where providers are failing to implement recommendations of the Health Service Ombudsman and Local Government Ombudsman.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000240"></a>I hope Members of the Committee would all agree that the onus must be on care providers, wherever possible, to resolve complaints themselves. I reassure the Committee that the Bill provides mechanisms to

Clause 16 enables the Secretary of State for Health to set, in regulations, the essential registration requirements that providers will need to meet in order to become, and remain, registered with the Care Quality Commission. Clause 16 already enables regulations to make provision for the handling of complaints and disputes.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000241"></a>Members of the Committee will be aware that we are consulting on key areas which these crucial registration requirements need to cover in order to provide proper assurances of safety and quality of care to patients and service users. Requirement 10 of the draft registration requirements proposes that there should be a requirement on registered providers and managers to have effective systems in place for handling complaints, and that they should learn from complaints. Indeed, this proposed requirement has been agreed by both the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman and the Local Government Ombudsman, and sets out that providers should:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000344"></a>&#147;Ensure that people and their relatives and carers are aware of and can use, with support where needed, and without prejudice to their care and treatment, simple and clear arrangements for handling comments and complaints. Ensure that complaints about failures to ensure people&#146;s health, safety and welfare are investigated and resolved promptly and effectively. Learning from complaints is reflected in risk management, quality assurance, clinical governance and training and development arrangements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000316"></a>I therefore do not believe that it is necessary to amend the provisions to make regulations ensuring that the commission takes into account not just how the provider handles complaints but also how the provider learns from those complaints. Furthermore, because the registration requirements will apply across both publicly and privately funded care, this should help to improve the situation for those people that Amendment No. 53B seeks to help.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000242"></a>We recognise that there is an issue about the fairness of current arrangements for people who either choose to seek care independently or who do not qualify for state support and feel that their complaints have been inadequately addressed. The Government are actively considering ways in which some form of independent resolution may be achieved for those groups; I very much hope to have some answers in due course. We are also looking at options for ensuring that local complaints arrangements are as consistent as possible, whether they relate to publicly or privately funded services. So, to the extent that the final registration requirements&#151;currently the subject of our consultation&#151;cover this issue, the commission will already have the powers it needs to ensure that registered care providers are handling complaints properly, whatever the arrangements may be to provide that care.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000243"></a>Let us remind ourselves that where registered care providers fail to meet registration requirements, the commission will be able to use the full range of its enforcement powers, not just issuing a warning notice as proposed by Amendments Nos. 58 and 58A. The emphasis in the new system we are putting in place for resolving complaints locally will also assist organisations to identify their mistakes, to learn lessons from them and to ensure that similar mistakes are not repeated.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000244"></a>The noble Baroness raised the capacity of the ombudsman to deal with some of these complaints. I quote from a letter from Ann Abraham, the Parliamentary Ombudsman for the UK and Health Service Ombudsman for England:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000345"></a>&#147;Clearly I recognise that, in the short term, the changes will result in an increase in the number of enquiries made to my Office and the number of investigations I undertake. I do not, however, expect to receive the same number of complaints for investigation as the Healthcare Commission has done. As evidence, I note that when the Scottish health system moved to a similar two-stage model at the time of the introduction of the Healthcare Commission in England, the number of investigations increased, but not unmanageably so ... I have recently restructured my Office and I am confident that we will be able to meet the forecast increases in my workload, and will be able to provide an efficient and effective response to demand&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000245"></a>I have tried to answer some concerns of the Members of the Committee. I take the point about the care provided for those who may not qualify for state support, and am more than happy to look into that further. With the assurances I have given Members of the Committee today, I hope that they can, at least at this stage, consider withdrawing their amendments.</p>

I do not wish to criticise the health ombudsman&#151;in fact, I think she is a wonderful health ombudsman&#151;but I think I am right in saying that the changes in Scotland to which she referred coincided with the introduction of the policy of free personal care. Therefore, in Scotland there was something that does not exist in England: a clear understanding of basic entitlements in health and social care. I point out to those who are unaware of it that we do not have a happy precedent, given that it has taken eight years for there to be some kind of resolution about what the criteria for NHS continuing care should be and consistent application of those criteria. I think we are underestimating the scale of the problem. I wish to highlight the point that a major element of the argument is costs in residential care. Regulating acute care, when one looks at what happens to a patient where there is a particular adverse incident, and looking at when a care home provider decides to up his or her fees and the person who is paying for himself takes issue with that are wholly different. That is a commercial transaction. It is worth reiterating that within this one regulator we are seeking to bring together things that are at present in separate systems, both of which are wanting. Putting them together may compound a lot of the problems. I urge the Minister not to underestimate the scale of the problems that will have to be dealt with.</p>

Providers already have an obligation to deal with complaints properly and to follow up recommendations, but it does not happen. The whole point of this debate has been to say that complaints really matter in terms of public confidence in health and social care services. There needs to be a robust system&#151;it seems to us that the only sensible robust system has to be with the CQC&#151;to make sure that complaints are properly dealt with and that recommendations are properly followed up in good time. That is the other thing; these things can go on for years. I do not think I heard the Minister give an assurance that the CQC will be required to follow up and deal with complaints and recommendations from complaints. The Minister referred to the powers of the CQC to do that, but the purpose of this debate is to say that leaving it with the opportunity to do that is not sufficient. I think I heard the Minister say that he would think a little more about this, which was encouraging, and I would be grateful if he would give us an assurance that he will think further about this. I hope that he will take very seriously the point that we are making that there is a need in terms of public confidence to bite this one and make sure that the CQC deals with it.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000252"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am grateful for the support from other noble Lords for these amendments, which are many and all relate in some way or another to putting human rights at the heart of the work of the Care Quality Commission. I will try to explain the perspective of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on this and why the Bill has such profound human rights significance.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000253"></a>The human rights framework has considerable importance in structuring the ethos of public life in this country. In saying that, I build on much that has already been said this afternoon. The European Convention on Human Rights played that role for many years, but the framework was, as the Government say, brought home by the Human Rights Act 1998. That Act signalled a change and brought into being a framework within which the states&#146; actions towards individuals should be shaped. I refer here not only to areas in which the state takes powers to coerce someone or deprive them of their liberty, such as in counterterrorism and criminal justice or in the detention of patients under Mental Health Act powers. This is about how the state, and those through whom it works, deals with human beings.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000254"></a>This view of human rights has led the Joint Committee on Human Rights to broaden its work and to undertake two major thematic inquiries: one  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>into older people and healthcare, and one into the treatment of adults with learning difficulties. Both those inquiries were revelatory for committee members and brought us into contact with the meaning of human rights to a very broad range of people&#151;those who are being cared for and those who work with those who are being cared for. I stress that the human rights framework is enormously important for those who care for people, because it enables them to see their work within an ethical framework through which they can articulate their values as caring professionals. It also enables them to stand up to anyone who tells them to cut corners and leave the old lady lying in a dirty bed, and to feel that they must blow the whistle when abuse needs to be exposed.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000255"></a>The human rights framework is also part of each individual&#146;s relationship with the state. It means that we can expect that our right to life will be protected, that we should not be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, that our right to family life shall be respected, and a number of other rights. By simply listing those three, however, I hope it is clear to the Committee that the work of the Care Quality Commission will have human rights work at its heart.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000256"></a>I also resort to recounting a personal experience. Some years ago, I had an illness that kept me in hospital for quite a long time. I was in a wheelchair for six months. It was a profoundly educational experience. When I was recovering, I amused myself by writing about it. Articles appeared in the health pages of both the <I>Times</I> and the <I>Guardian</I>, if I remember rightly. My main thought was that my experience was parallel to that of my day job, in which I dealt with matters relating to prisons, prisoners and the protection of basic rights. Everyone needs the protection of those rights, and it became clear to me in hospital that I was one of those who needed them. First, there is huge potential for ill-treatment, neglect and abuse when one is a patient or someone who is being cared for. You are without power and you feel that you are without it. Your feeling of powerlessness is increased enormously by the potential humiliations that you can suffer through the invasion of personal privacy. If they do not have time to give you a shower, you cannot have a shower, so you feel dirty and smelly all day. You then wish that your visitors were not coming because you do not want them to see you in that state. It is very difficult to do anything about those things because you are completely dependent on your carers. If you try to do anything about it, what happens to you could get worse, rather than better.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000257"></a>Those are classic human rights situations where protection is called for. They are the issues behind the whole conceptual framework of human rights. I know that the Government are not at all convinced by those arguments. They have said, as the Minister said in response to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, that the application of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998&#151;the duty to act compatibly with convention rights&#151;will mean that the Care Quality Commission will automatically take into account convention rights, and that there is no need to do any more about it. The Government say that the broad regulation-making power in Clause 16,</p>




<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC49"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="08042990000356"></a>&#147;already is sufficiently wide to enable regulations to be made in relation to the health and safety and welfare of service users and to secure their Convention rights&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000317"></a>Finally, the Government say that the inclusion of express reference to the Convention rights in Clause 16 could lead to uncertainty as the scope of an obligation to make regulations to secure rights would not be easy to determine. The Government do not wish the Care Quality Commission to become a quasi-judicial body.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000258"></a>Perhaps I could ask the Minister whether the Government understand that Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the Care Quality Commission to act compatibly with convention rights&#151;not merely to take them into account. Taking them into account is not the same thing as acting compatibly with them. Do the Government consider that the inclusion of obligations in respect of rights could create any greater uncertainty for the commission than the inclusion of obligations in relation to health and safety or welfare? Why would the inclusion of that obligation lead to the Care Quality Commission becoming quasi-judicial and why would that be so inappropriate? How would that differ from the role that the commission would play in relation to the protection of health and safety, and welfare?</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000259"></a>In our discussions and in the Government&#146;s response to the Joint Committee, I feel that there has been a failure on the part of the Government to understand the profoundly important relationship between health and social care and human rights. I very much hope that the Government will be able to think again about their view on this and that maybe we shall make some progress. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000260"></a><a name="80429-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08042990000454"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> I support this group of amendments moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern. Collectively, these amendments would ensure that not just the CQC but all registered providers really have to think about the human rights of people in their care and that the CQC can back that up through its inspection process. The noble Baroness has moved the amendments comprehensively, so I wish to make two points in general support. The first is a general point and, secondly, I will support in particular Amendment No. 19. On the general point, the Minister has stated that the whole establishment of the CQC and the implementation of the legislation will take place and be deeply implicated in an ethos of human rights; but I am not sure that the drafting of the Bill bears that out.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000261"></a>Clause 16, for example, which was referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, contains the regulation-making power. Clause 16(2) simply says that regulations &#147;may&#148; make provision with a view to various things that do not include rights. That is why Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 have been tabled. They seek to ensure that regulations &#147;shall&#148; make provision with a view to,</p>
<ul><a name="08042990000357"></a>&#147;securing the health, safety, rights and welfare of persons for whom any such service is provided&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000318"></a>The other amendments in the group go through strengthening the legislation in respect of rights.  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Amendment No. 23 is also necessary to insert &#147;rights&#148;, and Amendment No. 28 has been tabled in general terms to provide:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000347"></a>&#147;The protection and promotion of human rights shall be central to the performance of the functions of the Commission&#148;. </p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000319"></a>Amendment No. 72 prescribes the content of standards and Amendment No. 76 would provide that respect for rights may be a quality indicator in periodic reviews. I submit that there is quite a lot in the drafting of the Bill to indicate that it needs quite a lot of strengthening before we can be confident that it will be implemented in an ethos and culture of human rights.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000262"></a>Secondly, I support Amendment No. 19 in particular, as it is an area of which I have particular knowledge, but also as proxy for the whole group. The JCHR has suggested that the CQC should perform its functions in a way that encourages health and social care providers to improve the information given to service users about their rights. In commenting on the JCHR&#146;s recommendations, the Minister in another place relied on the fact that the commission, NHS bodies and local authorities are all public authorities for the purposes of the Human Rights Act and that the courts have a role in enforcing rights, such as access to information. Therefore, we can rely on the fact that the Human Rights Act applies to these public bodies and that the courts will be there to enforce human rights where necessary.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000263"></a>In its 15th report at paragraph 3.25, the JCHR characterised the Minister&#146;s response to its recommendations as simply standing pat on the status quo and said that it regarded it as &#147;complacent&#148;. It referred to its report on the human rights of older people in healthcare, which,</p>
<ul><a name="08042990000358"></a>&#147;drew attention to the inadequacy of information provision, in accessible forms&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000320"></a>and to the fact that it had subsequently made similar findings in relation to adults with learning disabilities. It pointed out:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000348"></a>&#147;Reliance on the Human Rights Act has largely failed to improve the provision of accessible information about healthcare to vulnerable groups. Public authorities have tended to take a minimalist view of compliance with the Human Rights Act and not used the Act to positively enhance the protection and promotion of rights&#148;.</p>
</ul><h5><a name="08042990000373"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000264"></a>I can illustrate this matter from an area within my own knowledge by reference to a provision in the UN Convention on the Rights of Disabled People, which the UK has signed and I am sure shortly will ratify. Article 21, &#147;Freedom of expression and opinion, and access to information&#148;, says that states parties must provide,</p>
<ul><a name="08042990000359"></a>&#147;information intended for the general public to persons with disabilities in accessible formats and technologies appropriate to different kinds of disabilities in a timely manner and without additional cost&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000321"></a>I draw two morals from that.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000265"></a>First, if there is not a binding legal obligation on the UK Government to ensure disabled people&#146;s rights to information, there very soon will be in the light of the UN convention. That being the case, it is, at the very least, highly desirable, if not absolutely essential, that this obligation should be reflected&#151;the  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC51"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC51</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister may say anticipated, but why not since we are promised ratification by the end of this year&#151;in the Bill in relation to disabled people&#146;s rights to information from providers of health and social care.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000266"></a>The second moral I draw is that, as the JCHR says, it is absolutely essential to go further than the status quo if the situation is to be in any way satisfactory as regards the provision of information to disabled people. For health services alone, a recent survey of blind and partially sighted people in the UK showed that 95 per cent of respondents had never received health advice leaflets or information from their local surgery in their preferred format; 96 per cent had never received letters from their GP, results of tests or other correspondence in their preferred format; and 95 per cent had never received medicines labelled in large print.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000267"></a>That is the situation for disabled people, but I am in no doubt whatever that the situation in relation to the provision of information to other elderly and vulnerable people, and to people with learning disabilities will not be found to be materially different. Therefore, I speak in support of Amendment No. 19 in particular, but as an illustration of the need for this group of amendments as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000268"></a><a name="80429-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0007.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08042990000455"></a>Baroness Wilkins:</b> I strongly support this group of amendments, which is so vital to creating a genuine culture and respect for human rights across health and social care. They have been superbly covered by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and the noble Lord, Lord Low. I strongly support the need to make human rights central to the work of the new Care Quality Commission. As RADAR puts it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08042990000349"></a>&#147;Human rights are not &#145;just another consideration&#146;, they are the prime consideration underpinning everything else&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042990000322"></a>The core principles behind human rights are autonomy, dignity and equality, and it is these which must guide and inspire the new commission in its work. Indeed, we recently voted in support of measures to make sure that health and social care providers ensure that service users are empowered with information about their human rights and that rights are respected throughout the hospital discharge process, when we passed the Disabled Persons (Independent Living) Bill, introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000269"></a>Building a human rights culture across health and social care will require all the measures set out in these amendments, and more. So widespread is the level of ignorance and disrespect for basic human rights standards, we should take this opportunity to enact the JCHR recommendations without delay.</p>

It is relevant to quote to the Committee the results of a poll announced today by Age Concern. I declare an interest as vice president of Age Concern and as its former chief executive. The poll showed that people of all ages and incomes are deeply concerned about the quality of the personal care that they will get in old age. According to the poll, eight out of 10 people  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in Britain are concerned about the quality of care that they or their loved ones will get in later life. Four out of 10 people are not even confident that they will be treated with dignity or respect, despite a high-profile government campaign to address that.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000271"></a>When the media are taking on board something like that, it is in the Government&#146;s interest to make a definite claim to support the human rights of people in care or needing care and to put that on the face of the Bill. That would show commitment and would reverse the distrust or apprehension that so many elderly people feel. If the poll were repeated with disabled people, who may be younger, we would have precisely the same result.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000272"></a>The Government must make some sort of commitment urgently. In this respect, human rights mean dignity. We need the sort of care that leads to less malnutrition, respects privacy and stops people being evicted, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, described so eloquently, from what has become their home, because when that happens they get even more frail and vulnerable and need that protection even more.</p>

My mind goes back to one of the homes that I visited, to which I referred before, which is not very far from this institution. I described it as a place in which I would not be prepared to place an animal. I presume that the home cleared the inspection hurdles as being a satisfactory place.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000274"></a>One problem that I believe exists cannot be dealt with in the Bill, but it helps to emphasise the need for human rights to be embodied in the Bill. Staff in these homes often simply do not understand what human rights are. The reality is that in many private homes&#151;as I say, I am not in that profession, but many here will know exactly what I am talking about&#151;staff are on minimum wages at the bottom end of the wage market. They are often people who can find employment in very few areas other than in care, yet we presume that somehow, instinctively, they will want to flag up human rights issues in the way that they handle a client group. I do not believe that they necessarily do. Some of those on minimum wages are very good carers, but some, from what I hear, are appalling, and they remain in those institutions. Unless someone complains, which we talked about before, very little happens.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000275"></a>If we can embody in the Bill this human rights issue in a way whereby service providers cannot avoid it as a consideration, the responsibility will then be placed on them to ensure that those who they employ, at the very bottom end of the wages market, are well aware of their responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>

<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC53"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rights look like in an A&amp;E department. There is an approach to trauma medicine that can be conducted with due regard to human rights. I am not sure that that is the first thing that goes through practitioners&#146; minds, but it is still important. That flags up why this is important. We cannot talk about other rights in relation to healthcare or social care; we cannot talk about equality, for example. We cannot talk about non-discrimination. A large part of the practice of medicine is exactly about judgment and discrimination; what is appropriate and right for one group of patients, and one patient as opposed to another.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000278"></a>I suppose that it is precisely because we cannot talk about other rights as we know them and overcoming other forms of discrimination, because they do not logically apply, that, particularly in social care, people have come to have such an acute understanding of how the principles of human rights apply in a situation where individuals do not have entitlement and in which there are not infinite resources. There is much to do before people from the world of social care truly understand what the implementation of human rights means in an acute healthcare setting, and vice versa. That is why it is important to place this in the Bill and not to rely on the general public authority duty, which the Minister might be tempted to use as a recourse. We have only just begun to address the full implications of what this means. For the foreseeable life of this legislation, to have it in statute will be a necessary reminder, both to practitioners and users, of the basis of all their practice. That is why it has particular importance.</p>

I wholly agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, said about being vulnerable while being dependent on other people. This time, I hope that the Minister will explain why he cannot accept &#147;shall&#148;, if he cannot accept it. I hope that he will accept it. All vulnerable people should be protected; that is so important. There is bullying in some of these hospitals and homes, and above all else that should be stamped out.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000281"></a>Human rights issues were debated in depth in the other place, and the debate focused mainly on the public authority definition. However, I recognise that the Joint Committee has indicated that it was not fully convinced by some of the arguments that the Government put forward in relation to other amendments. I hope that I shall be able to explain the Government&#146;s position more clearly today.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000282"></a>Through this Bill, we are seeking to establish a unified framework for the regulation of health and adult social care services. It will create a level playing field for all registered providers across both the private and public sectors, but not all such providers will count as public bodies for the purposes of the Human Rights Act. That, fundamentally, is at the heart of why the registration requirements should lay down specific requirements that give effect to human

<h5><a name="08042990000374"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000283"></a>Dealing with each of the amendments proposed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in turn, Amendments Nos. 23 and 28 seek to give the commission a general duty to promote human rights. Amendment No. 23 would require it to encourage services to be provided in a way that focuses on the rights as well as the needs of the people using those services, and Amendment No. 28 proposes a general requirement that the protection and promotion of human rights should be central to the commission&#146;s work.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000284"></a>We have already included a requirement in Clause 2 for the commission to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of children and vulnerable adults in everything it does. We adopted that wording because it is important for the commission to pay particular attention to the needs of those who are less able to advocate for themselves. However, I also recognise the strength of feeling that the commission should take proper account of the rights of all people who use health and social care services. I have already undertaken to look again at the drafting in Clause 2 and will look at this issue as I do so. That would be the most appropriate way to reflect the intention behind Amendments Nos. 23 and 28, and I hope to come back to this on Report.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000285"></a>The remaining amendments propose changes to specific functions the commission will have to ensure that human rights issues are covered. Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 seek to ensure that regulations under Clause 16 will include requirements for securing the rights of people using health and social care services, as well as their health, safety and welfare. Amendment No. 76 proposes that respect for the rights of people using health and adult social care services should be included in the indicators of quality to be used in periodic reviews under Clause 42.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000286"></a>On Report in the other place, my honourable friend the Minister for Health gave an assurance that the registration requirements will be in line with the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights. In its 15th report, the Joint Committee on Human Rights queried whether this recognised that the European convention has legal force in the UK. I am advised that the convention itself does not&#151;in the same way as any other treaty to which the UK is party&#151;but the Human Rights Act gives very strong force to the substantive rights drawn from the convention. Crucially, however, the registration requirements will go beyond the convention rights, both in content and in their application to persons not subject to the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000287"></a>The Government want all providers to follow the sensible principles set out in the convention in order to ensure that they deliver appropriate and effective care. That is why it is our intention that the registration requirements reflect the spirit of the European convention. It is also through the registration requirements that the commission might have a role in monitoring the  


<notus-date day="29" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC55"></a><b>29 Apr 2008 : Column GC55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provision of information to people about their rights, although I maintain that that is primarily a role for the Equality and Human Rights Commission and will go on to outline what work it will be doing. As currently drafted, the registration requirements include a requirement to involve people in making informed decisions about their care and treatment. Something similar to this draft would address the proposal in Amendment No. 19, but Members of the Committee will be aware that those requirements are currently out to consultation. I will welcome views on whether we have got the balance right.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000288"></a>The Care Quality Commission will also have to bear convention principles in mind in its periodic reviews. Tackling health inequalities and social exclusion for vulnerable groups are government priorities for performance assessment. However, it would be impossible to set indicators that measure whether someone&#146;s rights have been respected as proposed by Amendment No. 76.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000289"></a>Moving on, Amendments Nos. 68, 70 and 72 relate to Clause 41, which enables the Secretary of State to publish statements of standards relating to healthcare provided and commissioned by primary care trusts. PCTs will need to have reference to standards issued under this clause in discharging their duty of improvement under Clause 133. Amendment No. 68 would require the Secretary of State to publish standards rather than enabling him to do so. Amendment No. 70 seeks to extend the standards to apply to all health and social care bodies.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000290"></a>The new clause proposed in Amendment No. 72 sets out a number of rights-related topics which it is proposed should be covered by these standards. It is important to remember that the standards which will be drawn up under Clause 41 are not intended to be requirements which providers of regulated activities must meet in order to be registered with the Care Quality Commission. Standards under Clause 41, on the other hand, will be designed as improvement tools to help to deliver high-quality publicly funded healthcare. We envisage that they will be used primarily by clinicians and managers to measure and improve the care they give to their patients and by patients to make informed choices about treatment providers.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000291"></a>The Secretary of State should not be required to issue standards, as envisaged by Amendment No. 68, rather than be enabled to do so. Standards will be issued only where it is clear that they can contribute to enhancing the quality of care, where there is a need for a common framework and terminology, and where there is a broad consensus between the department, clinicians, managers and patients about the role that standards can play in driving improvements. It is unnecessary to make similar provisions to apply to publicly funded social care, as envisaged by Amendment No. 70. Local authorities have their own local and national reporting and accountability arrangements, and the Minister for Communities and Local Government has powers to issue standards under the Local Government Act 1999.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000292"></a>It is our intention ensure that the standards can deliver real improvements in care by involving a wide range of individuals and bodies in drawing up their content and subjecting any new or changing standards to full public consultation. This is necessary to ensure that the standards are widely supported by the clinical community and patients. I am sure that the Joint Committee on Human Rights will have a valuable contribution to make to this future process and would be happy to ensure that it is informed of any standards consultations.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000293"></a>I hope that I have been able to set out clearly where I believe the commission should have a role in promoting the principles of human rights legislation and why it should not have more specific responsibility than I have outlined. However, I take seriously the concerns that the Joint Committee has expressed that public authorities have tended to take a minimalist view of compliance with the Human Rights Act and have not used the Act positively to enhance the protection and promotion of rights.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000294"></a>As to what the Government are currently doing, I think that most Members of the Committee will know that the Government have already distributed guidance and a toolkit on human rights in healthcare to the NHS, which is available to the public. Independent evaluators have been commissioned by the Department of Health to assess the benefits to NHS organisations of using human rights-based approaches. The department intends to publish the evaluation before the end of this year.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000295"></a>In addition&#151;and this is something close to my heart as a clinician working in the healthcare service&#151;the Social Care Institute for Excellence published <I>Promoting dignity within the law</I>, which was commissioned by the Department of Health to help practitioners and commissioners of health and social care services understand how legislation protects people&#146;s rights to be treated with dignity. It provides a concise guide to the law on discrimination and equality issues, but with strong emphasis on the centrality of a human rights-based approach to improving people&#146;s lives.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000296"></a>I hope that I have given Members of the Committee a helpful review of where the Government stand on the human rights issue. I have no doubt that we will be discussing this more in due course. I very much hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and the noble Lord, Lord Low, will agree to withdraw their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="08042990000297"></a><a name="80429-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80429-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08042990000461"></a>Baroness Stern:</b> I am very grateful to all Members of the Committee who have supported these amendments so eloquently and to the Minister for that extremely full reply. I have to admit that I shall need to read and concentrate on it fully in order to absorb the implications of the Government&#146;s response. I think I heard the Minister say that something we proposed, which was supported, is of interest to him. I see some nodding coming from that quarter, so that raises my spirits a little.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000298"></a>However, I do not quite understand why the Government find their own legislation so frightening. The Human Rights Act is not frightening at all. It just

It is not very demanding on resources and people do not find it difficult when they understand it. The people getting this service would rather be treated in that way, and the people giving the service would feel better about themselves and their professionalism if they gave the service like that. It is a gift. It is not something to run away from or to feel gets one into all sorts of difficulties.</p>

<a name="80429-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08042990000299"></a>I hope that this very helpful debate will encourage the Minister to look at the Human Rights Act as a blessing, rather than as something fearful, and that we might at the next stage be able to secure a little

<a name="08042965000006"></a><a name="80429-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80429-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08042965000019"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> On 18 March 2008, during the debate on the Second Review Conference of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), in response to a question by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, I said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08042965000018"></a>&#147;it is certainly correct that there are toxic chemicals that fall outside the so-called schedule 1 to this convention. One of the issues for review and for any successor convention after 2012 will be to make sure that there is a more comprehensive list of such chemicals&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/3/08; col. 136.]<I>.</I></ul>
<a name="80429-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08042965000007"></a>I should have said that the CWC&#146;s prohibitions apply to all toxic chemicals and their precursors, unless they are intended for permitted purposes and provided that they are of a type and in a quantity consistent with such purposes. The schedules of chemicals do not limit the scope of the convention&#146;s prohibitions; they provide only a framework for the application of verification measures. Reinforcing the comprehensive nature of the CWC has been a key UK objective for the Second Review Conference and the subject of one of the UK&#146;s four working papers submitted to the preparatory working group. It has also been a priority for the EU as set out in the EU&#146;s common position 2007/469/CFSP of 28 June 2007.</p>

<a name="80429-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08042965000008"></a>The CWC is a key component in the disarmament and non-proliferation agreements and regimes and will remain so after the 2012 deadline for completion of destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles. We have already started to consider how the CWC will need to adapt to face future challenges and see this as a key issue to be addressed in the years ahead.</p>

Since independence, there have been positive developments by the Kosovo Government in meeting these obligations, including the approval of a new constitution, which will come

The EU and NATO have also made progress in preparing to assume their responsibilities under the Ahtisaari proposals, including the European security and defence policy policing and rule of law mission in Kosovo and the implementation of NATO&#146;s new tasks in relation to Kosovo&#146;s own security forces.</p>

<a name="80429-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08042965000011"></a>During this period, the security situation has remained tense and there have been some sporadic incidents of violence. The NATO Kosovo Force (KFOR), in co-operation with the UN international police authorities, are working hard to address this and to maintain a safe and secure environment.</p>

<a name="80429-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08042965000012"></a>Against this background, the UK has received a request from NATO for the deployment of a UK battalion to Kosovo by the end of May as part of our existing commitment to the NATO-EU shared pan-Balkans Operational Reserve Force (ORF). This is a long-standing commitment that the UK meets in rotation with Italy and Germany. Since 1 January this year, it has been the UK&#146;s turn to provide the highest-readiness battalion for a period of six months. We are, therefore, well prepared to meet NATO&#146;s request and I have agreed to deploy our ORF battalion until 30 June 2008. The task will be undertaken by 2nd Battalion, The Rifles, which has been trained specifically for this requirement.</p>

<a name="80429-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08042965000013"></a>This deployment will demonstrate our commitment to the security of the region and will provide NATO with extra flexibility in maintaining peace and stability for all communities within Kosovo. The House will also wish to be aware that our commitment to the NATO-EU pan-Balkans ORF continues until the end of this year at a lower readiness.</p>

<a name="80429-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08042965000014"></a>I would like to stress that the deployment of the UK ORF battalion confirms yet again the professionalism of our Armed Forces and their ability to provide essential military support at short notice. I shall make a further Statement on this deployment in due course, if required.</p>

A further treaty was agreed in 1937 which reaffirmed the boundary in the Shatt al-Arab as established by the Constantinople Protocol. On 6 March 1975 a joint communiqu&#233; was issued in Algiers by Iran and Iraq relative to the resolution of the problems of their common boundary as follows: to undertake the final demarcation of their land boundaries on the basis of the Constantinople Protocol of 1913; and to delimit their river boundary according to the thalweg (deep water channel) line. Following World War II, problems continued along the boundary and Iran was keen to establish the actual position of the thalweg in the Shatt al-Arab. This process became a Treaty Relating to the State Boundary and Good-Neighbourliness between Iran and Iraq with three protocols and their annexes and was signed in Baghdad on 13 June 1975. The protocol relating to the river boundary included an annex of four admiralty charts of the Shatt al-Arab containing co-ordinates of the thalweg boundary. The boundary as agreed in these treaties was effectively ignored by Iraq during the Iran/Iraq war, but was reinstated in 1990. The boundary as defined in the 1975 treaty is therefore the present ratified boundary between Iran and Iraq and is depicted on our charts and maps.</p>
